<p>Creative Commons licenses<br />
              In December 2002, Creative Commons released its first set of copyright licenses for free to the public. Creative Commons developed its licenses â€” inspired in part by the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) â€” alongside a Web application platform to help you license your works freely for certain uses, on certain conditions; or dedicate your works to the public domain.</p>
<p>                In the years following the initial release, Creative Commons and its licenses have grown at an exponential rate around the world. The licenses have been further improved, and ported to over 50 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>              Science<br />
              Since 2005, Creative Commons has undertaken projects to build commons-based infrastructure for science through identifying and lowering unnecessary barriers to research, crafting policy guidelines and legal agreements, and developing technology to make research, data and materials easier to find and use.</p>
<p>              Education<br />
              Creative Commons also works to minimize legal, technical, and social barriers to sharing and reuse of educational materials, with dedicated projects in this field since starting in 2007.</p>
<p>              Global infrastructure for sharing<br />
              Creative Commons licenses, public domain tools, and supporting technologies have become the global standard for sharing across culture, education, government, science, and more.</p>
