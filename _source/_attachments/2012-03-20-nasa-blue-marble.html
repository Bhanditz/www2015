    NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Image by Reto StÃƒÂ¶ckli (land surface, shallow
    water, clouds). Enhancements by Robert Simmon (ocean color, compositing, 3D globes,
    animation). Data and technical support: MODIS Land Group; MODIS Science Data Support
    Team; MODIS Atmosphere Group; MODIS Ocean Group Additional data: USGS EROS Data
    Center (topography); USGS Terrestrial Remote Sensing Flagstaff Field Center (Antarctica);
    Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (city lights).\n\nThis spectacular Ã¢Â€Âœblue
    marbleÃ¢Â€Â\x9D image is the most detailed true-color image of the entire Earth
    to date. Using a collection of satellite-based observations, scientists and visualizers
    stitched together months of observations of the land surface, oceans, sea ice,
    and clouds into a seamless, true-color mosaic of every square kilometer (.386
    square mile) of our planet. These images are freely available to educators, scientists,
    museums, and the public. This record includes preview images and links to full
    resolution versions up to 21,600 pixels across.\n\nMuch of the information contained
    in this image came from a single remote-sensing device-NASAÃ¢Â€Â™s Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS. Flying over 700 km above the Earth onboard
    the Terra satellite, MODIS provides an integrated tool for observing a variety
    of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric features of the Earth. The land and coastal
    ocean portions of these images are based on surface observations collected from
    June through September 2001 and combined, or composited, every eight days to compensate
    for clouds that might block the sensorÃ¢Â€Â™s view of the surface on any single
    day. Two different types of ocean data were used in these images: shallow water
    true color data, and global ocean color (or chlorophyll) data. Topographic shading
    is based on the GTOPO 30 elevation dataset compiled by the U.S. Geological SurveyÃ¢Â€Â™s
    EROS Data Center. MODIS observations of polar sea ice were combined with observations
    of Antarctica made by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationÃ¢Â€Â™s
    AVHRR sensorÃ¢Â€Â”the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. The cloud image
    is a composite of two days of imagery collected in visible light wavelengths and
    a third day of thermal infra-red imagery over the poles. Global city lights, derived
    from 9 months of observations from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program,
    are superimposed on a darkened land surface map.\";s:17:\"created_timestamp\";s:1:\"0\";s:9:\"copyright\";s:0:\"\";s:12:\"focal_length\";s:1:\"0\";s:3:\"iso\";s:1:\"0\";s:13:\"shutter_speed\";s:1:\"0\";s:5:\"title\";s:0:\"\";}}"
