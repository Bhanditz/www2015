<p>Having been here at Creative Commons for a couple of weeks now, I'm excited to share what I'm working on this summer as a Google Policy Fellow.</p>
<p>A quick introduction: I'm currently a graduate student in Management Science &amp; Engineering at Stanford University. Before moving to Northern California, I lived in the Boston area where I worked at the Learning Games Network (LGN), a nonprofit spin-off of the MIT Education Arcade. While helping to develop a foundation-funded Open Educational Resource (OER) project at LGN, I came to appreciate the possibilities that open licensing can offer innovators in the philanthropic and nonprofit sectors.</p>
<p>The project I'm working on during my ten weeks here focuses on the use of Creative Commons licenses in the world of philanthropy. Our goal is to provide best practices that will help foundation leaders implement open licensing policies and ensure that the work they fund is available for others to build upon. This follows in the footsteps of last yearâ€™s <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2011/foundation_funding"><em>Foundation Funding: Open Licenses, Greater Impact</em></a>, published by the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society as an updated version of its 2009 report, <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2009/Open_Content_Licensing_for_Foundations"><em>An Evaluation of Private Foundation Copyright Licensing Policies, Practices and Opportunities</em></a>.</p>
<p>As the title of the Berkman Centerâ€™s update suggests, open licensing can be thought of as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplier">force multiplier</a> in the context of grant-making. Sharing the digital outputs of philanthropic investments under open licenses makes their reuse easier and increases their potential impact. If grantees produce documents, materials, or other content that could be applied in different settings or remixed in unanticipated ways that offer further social benefits, why not lower the barriers to these possibilities by automatically granting others permission (i.e., open licensing) to pursue these additional uses?</p>
<p>While a few foundations require or encourage their grantees to use open licenses in their work, this is not yet a standard practice. Some highlight their philosophies regarding open licensing, like the <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/about-us/our-philosophy/licensing/">Shuttleworth Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.soros.org/about/policies/intellectual-property">Open Society Foundations</a>, while others mandate specific licenses for selected programs or projects, like the <a href="http://nextgenlearning.org/sites/default/files/IP_Policy_105.pdf">Next Generation Learning Challenges</a> initiative that's funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.</p>
<p>Creative Commons encourages philanthropic funders to help lead the way for greater use of open licensing within the nonprofit sector. To learn what works and develop best practices, we're reaching out to foundations that have already incorporated open licensing into their grant-making processes, analyzing existing policies and the documents used to communicate them, and talking with others in the field to better understand the challenges to broader adoption. Our final output will be sample copyright licensing policies for foundations that want to establish new expectations for sharing the intellectual works they fund, while also preserving flexibility for those instances where reserving more rights might still make sense.</p>
<p>If you're a staff member at a grant-making foundation and would like to learn more about this project, please contact us at info@creativecommons.org.</p>
