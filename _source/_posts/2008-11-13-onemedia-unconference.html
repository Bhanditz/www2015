<p>If you can't attend the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10645">Standford Open Source (Un)Conference</a> this Friday because you are in London, you are in luck!  There is another unconference option right in your city!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.one-media.org/">Onemedia Unconference</a>, which is being held in London today and tomorrow, is hoping to provide a venue for all who are interested in how new or multiple media technologies will transform the business landscape.  The attendees of the conference will represent a variety of industries including TV, Film, Games, Animation, Mobile, Software, and  Music industries.</p>
<p>Especially useful will be what is produced by the conference: a report that collects all of the unconference's output from the wide breadth of topics that will be covered.  The report will be provided under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives</a> license so attendees are free to share this report with others to allow for more enhanced discussion to happen.</p>
<p>If you are interested in how businesses are reacting to and creating new changes in the content arena you should check out the conference if able or at least the report when it is released.</p>
