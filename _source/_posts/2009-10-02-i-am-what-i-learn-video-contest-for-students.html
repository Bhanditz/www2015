<p>Students over 13, including all struggling college students, have a chance to win $1,000 from the U.S. Department of Education in their "<a href="http://www.ed.gov/iamwhatilearn/index.html">I Am What I Learn</a>" video contest. eSchool News <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/top-news/index.cfm?i=60852">reports</a> that "to get students invested in their education, President Barack Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan have announced a new video contest, asking students to "inspire" them with their stories."</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.ed.gov/iamwhatilearn/index.html">I Am What I Learn</a>" asks you to answer the question, "Why is your education important to fulfilling your dreams?" in two minutes or less, and submit it to them by the Nov 2nd deadline. Be sure to visit the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/iamwhatilearn/index.html">site</a> for more details and to check out Secretary Arne Duncan's own video.</p>
