<p>With <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org">"Get Creative"</a>, our Flash movie, we took a shot at explaining Creative Commons' mission. We're fond of it, but we think you could do an even better job. On August 1st Creative Commons is launching the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/contest/">GET CREATIVE! Moving Image Contest</a>, a competition to create a 2-minute moving image that articulates the Creative Commons mission.  </p>
<p>
The 1st prize winner will receive an <a href="http://www.apple.com">AppleÂ® Power MacÂ® G5 Personal Computer</a>.<br />
Contest runs August 1st, 2003 to September 30, 2003. Please return to this site for official rules and entry restrictions.</p>
