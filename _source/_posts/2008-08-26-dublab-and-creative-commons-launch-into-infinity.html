<p>I'm happy to announce that <a href="http://www.dublab.com/">dublab</a> and Creative Commons have launched <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/">Into Infinity</a>, a CC-licensed art and music project themed around the infinite possibilities of creative reuse. The online exhibition is available now; physical installations are being planned for Winter 2008 and throughout 2009.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we distributed 12" circular canvases to a collection of visual artists. We also commissioned an array of musicians to create eight-second audio loops. We went through all of the submissions and posted the best online, including pieces by world-renowned graffiti artist <a href="http://keepdrafting.com/">Kofie</a>, 2008 Whitney Biennial alumni <a href="http://www.hawksandsparrows.org/">Lucky Dragons</a>, Anticon collective member <a href="http://www.myspace.com/nosdam">Odd Nosdam</a>, and electronic musicians <a href="http://www.flying-lotus.com/">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href="http://www.jimmytamborello.com/">Dntel</a> (AKA Jimmy Tamborello of The Postal Service).</p>
<p>Each time you refresh the site's <a href="http://www.intoinfinity.org/exhibition">exhibition</a> page, you'll get a new art and loop combination. All of the images and sounds are published under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial</a> license and (as you may have guessed) we strongly endorse the sharing and remixing of this project. You can download the pieces individually via the links on the exhibition page; you can also download the entire project (including the site's source code) all at once via the <a href="http://www.intoinfinity.org/exhibition/downloads">downloads</a> page.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for updates, because we're talking to new artists and musicians all the time and we'll be adding new pieces to the exhibition regularly. Soon, we'll also issue a formal call for remixes of Into Infinity's works, many of which we'll include in future versions of the show.</p>
<p>You can read a bit more about the project in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=8987&amp;preview=true">press release</a> we issued earlier today.</p>
