<p>Yesterday the European CC Leads have under their regional identity CC Europe <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/1/12/EU_Consultation_-_CC_Europe_response_final.pdf">responded (PDF)</a> to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm">'Public consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules'</a>, run by the EU Commission through its Internal Market and Services Directorate. Like several other groups, the CC Leads have stressed the need for more robust and flexible exceptions and limitations throughout the region, especially regarding transformative uses in general and educational uses in particular. They also urge the EU Commission to find ways for copyright law in Europe to better recognize creator's wishes to contribute to the 'voluntary Public Domain' through legal tools like CC0. They also <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/reform">highlighted once more</a> the fact that CC Licenses are a patch for certain aspects of the copyright system but not a fix that substitutes legislative action. According to the Commission, all responses to the 80 question consultation will be published at some point in the future.</p>
