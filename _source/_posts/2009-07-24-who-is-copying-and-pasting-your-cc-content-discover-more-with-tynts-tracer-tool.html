<p><a href="http://tynt.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16061" title="Tynt Logo" src="img/logo_tynt.gif" alt="Tynt Logo" width="85" height="74" /></a> If you're one of the couple dozen people who copied text off our blog yesterday, you may have noticed some more text accompany your clipboard when you pasted it -- a link to our site and the license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a>) we've offered our content under. This is because we've installed <a href="http://www.tynt.com">Tynt's</a> <a href="http://tracer.tynt.com/features-and-benefits-of-tracer#">Tracer tool</a> on our blog which uses a bit of javascript wizardry to concatenate attribution and, as of now, particular CC license information to content copied from our site.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how this works, try selecting some text from anywhere on our blog and pasting it somewhere. Rich text editors (such as most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG HTML</a> editors, or Gmail) will preserve the hyperlink but the text will also show up in standard plain text editors as well.</p>
<p>As a creator and contributor to the commons, you have the right to attribution (all six of our licenses require it), so why not make it easy for your audience to automatically provide it?</p>
<p>Setting up and installing Tracer on your own site is easy, just head over to the site, <a href="https://tcr1.tynt.com/tracer/log_in">create an account for your domain</a>, select the CC license you've released your work under, and add the javascript tags to the footer of your pages. You'll then be able to see on your Tracer dashboard precisely which text and images are being copied and pasted from your site, and where they are going.</p>
<p>And don't worry, the extra markup is just text. Nothing about Tynt's tool forces reusers to do anything, its merely useful additional information providing proper attribution and license notification.</p>
