<p>There's an update to mozCC available.  You can find all the gory details <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc/news/">here</a>, but suffice it to say you really should upgrade.  This release fixes a couple of naggling bugs, and adds support for <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a>.  Flock is a browser based on the Mozilla Firefox codebase which integrates several interesting tools to make your browsing experience more seamless.  Ideas?  Suggestions?  <a href="http://yergler.net/yiki/MozCc/FeatureRequests">Write them down</a> and we'll see what we can do.</p>
