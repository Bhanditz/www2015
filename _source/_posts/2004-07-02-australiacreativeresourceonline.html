<p><a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/acro/">Australia Creative Resource Online</a>, a project funded by the Australian government, has launched its pilot site.  Their aim is to create a <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/acro/information.html">digital junkyard</a>, and have articulated a very compelling economic argument as to why this should exist.  Currently, they are <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/acro/contribute.html">taking submissions</a> for content, and are even willing to (selectively) digitize your content for free.  They plan to go live in September, and will use <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/au/">Creative Commons Australia licenses</a>.</p>
