<p>[...]Â  So one question comes up a lot: how is it consistent to have a license (such as CC-BY) that allows derivative works to be made while at the same time recognizing that the author reserves his moral rights? Isn't any derivative work an infringement of moral rights, when they exist? [...]"</p></blockquote>
