<p><a href="http://wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,69042,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_6">Wired News posted an article</a> yesterday covering the story of LA-based comedy collective <a href="http://www.thelonelyisland.com/">The Lonely Island</a>. Like most comedians, they spent years trying to get discovered but they did one thing unusual: they posted all their comedy shorts and songs to their extensive website with Creative Commons licenses. Thanks to <a href="http://www.thelonelyisland.com/music.html">their licensed music</a>, they soon found other artists began making remixes of their tunes which they also posted.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, they got tapped to create a comedy pilot episode (called <em>Awesometown</em>) for Fox TV, but Fox eventually passed on the show. Instead of letting the show wither on a shelf somewhere, the group <a href="http://www.thelonelyisland.com/awesometown/">posted the full video both cut and uncut</a>. The edgy, quirky short spread like wildfire online and eventually landed all three performers an audition spot for <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/">Saturday Night Live</a> (SNL).</p>
<p>Tonight's episode of SNL is the season debut, featuring all three members of The Lonley Island as part of the show. Andy Samberg will be a cast member, with Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer as writers. Creative Commons would like to congratulate Lonely Island and wish them good luck and fun times in NYC.</p>
