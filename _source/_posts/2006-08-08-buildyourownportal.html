<p><a href="http://www.zimbio.com/">Zimbio</a> is fairly new to the scene â€” it allows people to build and participate in "public portals" with others who share their interests. A portal can include photographs, links to websites and articles, a group blog, online discussion forum, recommended RSS feeds, and live chat about the subject.  While we've all learned to love <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, unlike Wikipedia which seeks to offer a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">neutral point of view</a>, Zimbio is about opinions and discussion among like-minded people.  You can find, build and engage in dialogue about a diverse range of topics including <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/portal/Podcasting+Law">podcasting law</a>, <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/portal/Energy+Conservation">engery conservation</a>, or the <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/portal/Tour+de+France">Tour de France</a>. Zimbio has also partnered with companies like Webshots, SmugMug, and Flickr for photos, Aim, Skype, and Yahoo for instant messaging, and Topix, Sphere, and Blogdigger for news and blog search.
