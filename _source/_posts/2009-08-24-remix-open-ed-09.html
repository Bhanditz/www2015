<p>This year's <a href="http://openedconference.org/">open education conference</a> was held in breathtaking Vancouver, BC and the ccLearn team (consisting of Lila Bailey, Ahrash Bissell, Alex Kozak, and myself) was there to soak it all in. Vancouver could be the emerald city, or an alternate reality to San Francisco, from whence three of us hail. This parallel universe yielded skyscrapers made of turquoise tinted glass, Lion's gate (sea foam green instead of Golden Gate's deceptive red), and a plethora of downtown eats and night life. The conference itself was located right next to the Vancouver Art Museum, home of the Dutch masters. </p>
<p>While my colleagues presented OpenEd (<a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org">opened.creativecommons.org</a>, the global open education community site we launched earlier this month), the <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=Cf7SBEwRDEhdXP3JOlrh7g_3d_3d">OER Copyright survey</a>, and cogitated on whether international copyright exceptions and limitations can support a global learning commons---I had the chance to run around with lots of people and talk to some of them. I was pleasantly surprised by the increase in diverse persons and locales represented, and I picked each of their brains for a few seconds with the help of my Flip cam. </p>
<p>The result is this <a href="http://blip.tv/file/2512680"><strong>video</strong></a> (blip.tv), which we hope you will enjoy and encourage you to <strong>remix</strong>! It's all open via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY</a>, including the soundtrack---laid with the album Ambient Pills by Zeropage (thanks to <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/2843">Jamendo</a>). We also have lots of footage we didn't include due to time constraints, so you may see snippier iterations down the line. </p>
<p>The video is also available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUS8nbyrEY">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/6255216">Vimeo</a>.</p>
