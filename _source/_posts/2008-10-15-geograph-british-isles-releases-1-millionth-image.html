<p>Just <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8471">three months ago</a>, we were praising the GBI project's effort to release torrents of their image database, which then totaled 860,000 images. Congrats to the GBI project on this huge milestone - read more about their project <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/help/freedom">here</a>, including their well articulated points on the benefits of remaining free and open.</p>
