<p><a href="http://www.streamingsuitcase.com/">The Streaming Suitcase</a> is a brand new site developed by <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~adam/">Adam Hyde</a>, where you can find CC-licensed manuals on a variety of technical topics. Learn how to stream media over the internet, study Linux basics, or even build your own mini FM transmitter. The whole site is great, but one thing that especially struck us was Adam's great illustration of his business model:</p>
<blockquote><p>In part this is an experiment in developing a model for the sustainable development of professional online documentation and manuals released under Creative Commons. So if you need a manual to be written on streaming and associated topics, and you have a commissioning budget then write to me and I will write one. This means you get a manual, I get some cash to support my nomadic artist life, and others benefit from having a nice manual too.</p>
