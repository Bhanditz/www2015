<p style="margin-left: 40px"> "    Because the indemnification received by the violation of a Creative Commons license - the first case in Chile and Latin America - the "Panda Punk Lab" was inaugurated yesterday (Monday), which will benefit more than 200 students of the E-120 "MarÃ­a Saavedra" School, ChillÃ¡n.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">During the ceremony, the Director of Studies of <a href="http://www.derechosdigitales.org/">NGO Derechos Digitales</a>, Alberto Cerda, emphasized how this donation ratifies the validity of the CC licenses to share and spread intellectual works, and protect them from non-authorized uses.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px" align="left">The case was born in April of 2007 when designer Armando Torrealba realized one of his works - a panda bear drawing with pink punk hair - was used by a retail store for publicity without his authorization. After NGO Derechos Digitales' intervention, <a href="http://www.derechosdigitales.org/2007/04/13/creative-commons-logra-triunfo-historico-en-la-proteccion-de-los-derechos-de-autor/">the enterprise indemnified the professional with a non-specified amount</a>, part of which was destined to the implementation of this laboratory."</p>
