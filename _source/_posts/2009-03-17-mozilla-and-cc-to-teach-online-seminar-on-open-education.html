<p><a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org">ccLearn</a> is collaborating with the <a href="http://www.peer2peeruniversity.org/">Peer 2 Peer University</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education">Mozilla</a> to teach practical open education skills to educators and anyone else who is interested. From the announcement on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/EduCourse/Announcement">course wiki</a>: </p>
<p>"This six week course is targeted at educators who will gain basic skills in open licensing, open technology, and open pedagogy; work on prototypes of innovative open education projects; and get input from some of the world leading innovators along the way.</p>
<p>The course will kick-off with a web-seminar on <em>Thursday 2 April 2009</em> and run for 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Weekly web seminars introduce new topics ranging from content licensing to the latest open technologies and peer assessment practices. Participants will share project ideas with a community of peers, work on individual projects, and get feedback from experienced mentors. We will also take a close look at some of the most innovative examples of open education projects, and speak to the people who designed them, including:</p>
<li>The Open Source Software courses at Seneca College;</li>
<li>David Wiley's Introduction to Open Education;</li>
<li>The open blog infrastructure at Mary Washington University; etc.</li>
<p>The course is targeted at educators who want to help shape the open education future. Participants should have some knowledge of web technologies, or open content licensing, or open pedagogy (or all three), but don't need to be experts.</p>
