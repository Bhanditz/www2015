Apple just announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2004/may/05itunes.html">they sold 3.3 million songs in 7 days</a> on the iTunes Music Store. To put this in perspective, the entire top ten of the Billboard music chart is tracking just over <a href="http://www.selloutcentral.com/archives/000058.php">2 million units</a>. If anyone in the music industry doubted that people would ever want to pay for music online, Apple's recent sales explosion clearly points out that it's here to stay.</p>
