<p>Wow, some really killer tracks have been submitted to ccMixter's <a href="http://ccmixter.org/ghostly">Christopher Willits Remix Contest</a>. Check out some of the entries <a href="http://ccmixter.org/ghostly/view/contest/entries">here</a>. Or better yet, sign up for an account and upload your own remix -- you still have four days left, as the contest stops accepting entries on December 27. Don't forget -- the winner will have her or his remix featured on a CD compilation to be distributed with future issues of <a href="http://www.xlr8r.com/"><em>XLR8R</em></a> magazine!</p>
