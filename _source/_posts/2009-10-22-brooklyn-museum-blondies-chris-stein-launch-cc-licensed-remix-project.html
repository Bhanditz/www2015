<p><img style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" title="4" src="img/4.png" alt="4" width="130" height="126" />On October 30th, Brooklyn Museum will open <em><a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rock_and_roll/">Who Shot Rock &amp; Roll</a></em>, an exhibition commemorating photographers and their creative role in rock &amp; roll history. To celebrate, the museum has teamed up with Chris Stein - co-founder of the legendary new wave band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_%28band%29">Blondie</a> (and one of the photographers featured in the exhibit) - for a companion musical project called <em>Who Shot Drums and Bass</em>.</p>
<p><em>Drums and Bass</em> is made up of eight original songs composed by Stein in <a href="http://www.submersiblemusic.com/TemplateMain.aspx?contentId=7">DrumCore</a> and released under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike</a> license. Brooklyn Museum is asking remixers to download the tracks from its <a href="http://soundcloud.com/brooklynmuseum/sets/chris-stein-for-who-shot-rock-and-roll">Soundcloud page</a> and remix them for the <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rock_and_roll/remix.php">Who Shot Rock &amp; Roll: Remix!</a> contest. Remixes are due December 1st, and will be judged by Stein and Matthew Yokobosky - Brooklyn Museum's Chief Designer. The creator of the winning remix will receive a copy of the <em>Who Shot Rock &amp; Roll</em> companion book signed by author Gail Buckland and have their remix featured during the <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/visit/first_saturdays.php">Target First Saturday</a> party in January.</p>
<p>More info, including contest rules and registration, is available <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/rock_and_roll/remix.php">Brooklyn Museum's website</a>.</p>
