<p>Just a reminder that the first Creative Commons Technology Summit is coming up in less than two weeks.  There's still space to <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~nathan/techsummit/">register</a> if you're interested in attending.</p>
<p>The list of panelists has grown; the full schedule is available <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18">in the wiki</a>.  We're looking forward to great discussions around digital asset management, digital copyright registries and how CC technologies integrate with and enable them.  And for those of you who aren't in the Bay Area, we're planning to make video from the day available online.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p>
