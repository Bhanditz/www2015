After discovering the dozens of unauthorized and possibly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvvhDngERXo">infringing remix videos</a> that resulted from his adamant calls not to remix his <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=12008">interview with CC founder, Lawrence Lessig</a>, Stephen Colbert is mad. He's so mad he featured <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/216595/january-21-2009/stephen-s-remix-challenge">a new segment and music video challenging fans not to remix his show any more</a>. He reiterated this demand in a staccato a capella, so that fans could clearly understand what he was saying and not sample his words. If someone were to remix his show or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Am-America-So-Can-You/dp/1600240364">audio book</a>, they certainly shouldn't upload it to <a href="http://community.colbertnation.com/RemixUpload">the special section of Colbert Nation soliciting uploads, either</a>.</p>
