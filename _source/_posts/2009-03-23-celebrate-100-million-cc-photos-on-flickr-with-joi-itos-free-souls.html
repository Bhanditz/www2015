<p>Over the last couple of weeks we've been keeping a close eye on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/License_statistics#Flickr_data">number of CC licensed photos of Flickr</a>. Our calculations now show that Flickr has surpassed 100 million CC licensed photos sometime during <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~paulproteus/stats/flickr/2009-03-21.csv">the day on Saturday, March 21st, 2009</a>. As of Monday, we're calculating <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~paulproteus/stats/flickr/2009-03-23.csv">the total number of CC licensed photos at 100,191,085</a>.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p>These photos have been used in hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia articles, blog posts, and even mainstream press pieces; all examples of new works that might not otherwise been created without our standardized public licenses. Flickr's integration of CC licenses was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4287">one of the first and best</a>; not only do they allow users to specify licenses per-photo, but they offer an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons">incredible CC discovery page</a> which breaks down searches for CC licensed materials by license. This means that you can look for all the photos of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=New+York+City&l=4&s=int">New York City licensed under Attribution and sorted by interestingness</a>, to give an example.</p>
<p>As part of our celebration of Flickr passing this historic milestone, <strong>we are offering a dozen copies of Creative Commons CEO Joi Ito's <a href="http://www.freesouls.cc">Free Souls</a> book at our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/join">$100  donation level</a>.</strong> Naturally, all of Joi's photos are not only licensed under our most permissive <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a> license, but they're also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/tags/freesoulsbook/">available on Flickr for download</a>. By donating to Creative Commons today you can support the work that we do and receive one of the <a href="http://www.freesouls.cc">1,024 copies of Joi's limited edition book</a>.</p>
<p><small><sup>*</sup>We are linking to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> files generated per-day based a simple scrape of Flickr's CC portal. To generate the total number of licensed photos, we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet#Formula">SUM()</a>'d the 2nd column of the CSV file. <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~paulproteus/stats/flickr/2009-03-21.csv">March 21st</a> yielded approximately 99 million and <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~paulproteus/stats/flickr/2009-03-22.csv">March 22nd</a> yielded over 100 million, hence our estimate that 100 million was passed sometime during the day on Saturday.</small></p>
