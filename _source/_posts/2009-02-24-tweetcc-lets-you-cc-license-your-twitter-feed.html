<p><a href="http://www.tweetcc.com/"><img src="img/picture-21.png" alt="tweetCC" title="tweetCC" width="259" height="98" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13001" /></a>Until now, the only way to mix your microblog and Creative Commons licenses was to sign up for the free-as-in-speech service <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a> <a href="http://laconi.ca/trac/">(or run your own instance of Laconica</a>), which <a href="http://identi.ca/doc/faq">requires all posts to be under our Attribution license</a>. But as of February 18th, thanks to the work of UK author Andy Clarke, you can CC license your twitter feed via <a href="http://www.tweetcc.com">TweetCC</a>. </p>
<p>The idea is to post a tweet to <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> letting <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tweetcc">@tweetCC</a> know that what license (or waiver, in the case of <a href="http://www.tweetcc.com/cc/zero.php">CC Zero</a>) you want your feed to be under, and then the service keeps track of your choice for the rest of the web's reference.  Users can also look up whether and how a given Twitter user has chosen to license their feed. Right now, our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">Public Domain Dedication</a> is the default and thereby <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%40tweetcc">most popular choice</a>, but <a href="http://www.tweetcc.com/cc/">take a look at the rest of our licenses offered on the site</a>, and CC license your twitter feed today!</p>
