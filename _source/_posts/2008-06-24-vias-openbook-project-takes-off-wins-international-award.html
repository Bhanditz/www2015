<p><a href="http://www.viaopenbook.com">Big news coming out this month on VIA's OpenBook mini-notebook computer</a> project which incorporates an "open design" approach that makes the CAD design plans for the device available to the public under the permissive terms of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">a Creative Commons BY SA license</a>.  The project invites customers to innovate and solicits suggestions from users on future iterations of the laptop. To spur involvement, they've <a href="http://www.viaopenbook.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=1">even recently released a video</a> that opens the laptop up and showcases the electronic guts that enable OpenBook's users the flexibility to add modules and <a href="http://www.viaopenbook.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=10">choose openly between wireless options</a>.</p>
<p>Happy to announce that since we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8320">first reported on the laptop's debut in May</a>, the project has taken off. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/05/27/via-openbook-hands-on/">Engadget</a> recently reviewed the product, writing simply that the OpenBook made "that Macbook Air look positively last century." And, this month, before an international jury of design experts at this years <a href="http://www.computextaipei.com.tw/">Taipei Computex</a>, the VIA OpenBook has taken home the <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/resources/pressroom/pressrelease.jsp?press_release_no=2389">Gold Award for Design and Innovation</a> for 2008. Congratulations guys!</p>
