<p>Our good friend and new media sociologist Alek Tarkowski from CC Poland has been working hard to compile data for a new report on Flickr user patterns and content licensing. This'll be a great boost for deepening our developing <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Flickr_Case_Study">case study</a>, and will go a long way to supporting <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics">our ongoing efforts</a> to develop an understanding of how creators release their works.</p>
<p>But he needs your help to gather data! You can get a link to <a href="http://ankiety.icm.edu.pl/index.php?sid=31587&amp;lang=en">his short survey here</a>. Definitely worth the few minutes.</p>
