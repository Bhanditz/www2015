<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a> is a blog run by the design gurus at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 Signals</a>, who strive for attractiveness and simplicity in all their designs. They have a regular feature where  they ask their audience of designers to come up with ways to describe difficult concepts in 10 words or less. <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000904.php">Today they decided to take a crack</a> at helping come up with a simple, concise way to describe the Creative Commons.</p>
<p>So far, they've already come up with a few good slogans, but if you can think of a way to describe Creative Commons to folks that have never heard of it, in just a few words, be sure and <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000904.php">post your ideas on the thread</a>.</p>
