<p>The ACIA workshop (like ASIA, with a "C"), is the highly-anticipated, self-sponsored event organized by Creative Commons jurisdiction project teams and other commons-based initiatives, and they are inviting all interested parties to attend the workshop with a focus on the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strengthening the â€œAsia Commonsâ€ by bringing in more members and improving links to related organizations within the Asia Pacific region;</li>
<li>Promoting the commons in the region, and providing a forum to develop practical strategies for this promotion;</li>
<li>Providing a forum for industry engagement, and in particular identifying and presenting successful commercial uses of open content licensing within the region;</li>
<li>Providing a forum for discussion of topics of importance to the Asia Commons (e.g., the meaning of â€˜openâ€™ in our age, and the history and role of the commons in Asia).</li>
</ol>
