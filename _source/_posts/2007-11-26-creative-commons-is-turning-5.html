<p>CC is turning 5 and to celebrate we're throwing a community-wide party. If you'll be in the San Francisco Bay Area on December 15, join us for a night of celebrating the commons at a party generously sponsored by <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://www.lastfm.com">Last.fm</a>. The evening will feature announcements by <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a> and <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, a live acoustic performance by <a href="http://www.gilbertogil.com.br/">Gilberto Gil</a>, video remixing by <a href="http://www.phi-phenomenon.com/">Phi Phenomenon</a>, and music provided by <a href="http://www.djspooky.com/">DJ Spooky</a>. Space is limited so please RSVP to party@creativecommons.org as soon as possible to let us know if you will be joining us (seriously, please do this!). Details are listed on our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/8/8c/Flier-general-final.pdf" title="CC 5 Flyer">birthday flyer</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not in the Bay Area, don't worry. There will also be parties in Berlin and New York City. For more details about these events, or if you want to register a party in your own part of the world, check out our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party">wiki page</a> for more information. <a href="http://air.mozilla.com/">Air Mozilla</a> will be streaming Gilberto Gil's performance for those who won't be able to attend any of the parties. And of course, please feel free to celebrate CC in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life</a> as well.</p>
<p>No matter where you are in the world, we invite you to celebrate CC's five years of helping to keep culture free and celebrate the future of participatory culture.</p>
