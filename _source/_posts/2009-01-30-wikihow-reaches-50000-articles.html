<p><img src="img/wikihow.gif" alt="wikihow" width="211" height="61" align="right" /><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/">wikiHow</a>, a community site that aims to be the world's largest how-to manual, just reached the incredible milestone of 50,000 articles with the publication of <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Obtain-a-Copy-of-Your-Birth-Certificate-in-New-Mexico"><em>How to Obtain a Copy of Your Birth Certificate in New Mexico</em></a>. All of the content on wikiHow is <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Creative-Commons">released</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>, keeping the content therein open for sharing and reuse according as long as the reuse is noncommercial in intent, the author(s) is properly attributed, and any derivative works are shared under the same license. This has broad ramifications, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7700">described by Rebbeca Rojer</a> a little over a year ago as wikiHow passed the 25,000 article mark:</p>
<blockquote><p>wikiHow is a great example of the possibilities for participatory culture opened by Creative Commons licenses. According to wikiHow founder, Jack Herrick, â€œCreative Commons licensing has been a necessary ingredient of our success thus far. These licenses allow others to easily share, republish and modify our content which furthers our mission. In addition, the licenses provide our editors with the â€œRight to Forkâ€, which gives our community comfort that their work will always be freely available to them and others.â€</p>
<p>Jack continues â€œIâ€™m optimistic that one day wikiHow will offer accurate, helpful how-to instructions on almost every topic in almost every language. Iâ€™m looking forward to sharing a how-to manual in Arabic, Chinese, German, Hindi, Japanese, Polish and many other languages we donâ€™t currently serve. Fortunately Creative Commons licensing exists in all these languages and will help us along this path.â€

<p>Congratulations to wikiHow, who are ever supportive of Creative Commons both in their mission and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10557">their actions</a>.</p>
