<p>Recently we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14023">launched the second round of a questionnaire on noncommercial use</a>, this one focusing on users.  Read that post for details, or <strong><a href="http://ur1.ca/3e27">hop directly to the questionnaire, which takes 15-25 minutes to complete</a></strong>.  The questionnaire will be open through May 5.</p>
<div style="float:right;padding:10px"><a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/nc-study/NC_Use_Study_Interim_Report_20090501.pdf"><img src="img/nc-study-contacted.png" alt="nc-study-contacted" width="443" height="333" /></a></div>
<p>We'll be publishing preliminary data (note: free text answers will be removed for privacy) and reports from the first round after this second questionnaire is closed -- as well as some thoughts from CC on noncommercial licensing that won't be any news to anyone who has followed really closely this blog, the initiatives of our science and education programs, and our CEO Joi Ito's speeches. Many thanks to everyone who has asked about study results so far. We're getting information out as quickly as possible, given how busy we are, and not wanting to interfere with this round of data collection. Of course as mentioned previously a full report on the entire study will be available in July.</p>
<p>To whet your appetite (and hopefully encourage your participation in the current questionnaire), we're releasing <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/nc-study/NC_Use_Study_Interim_Report_20090501.pdf">preliminary slides (.pdf)</a> reporting on interesting data gathered in the first round that won't influence the current round -- on the profiles and activities of a random panel of U.S. content creators and those of "CC Friends & Familiy", i.e., people who took the first questionnaire as publicized from the CC website -- a self-explanatory slide from that set is to the right, as well as a <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/nc-study/nc-study-creators-questions-datamap.ods">list of questions asked in the first round (.ods)</a>, as some of you have requested.</p>
<p>Please contribute to this research -- <a href="http://ur1.ca/3e27">take the questionnaire on noncommercial use for users</a> -- and spread the word. You have through May 5!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> The questionnaire closes 6PM Pacific on May 5. That's 01:00 GMT on May 6.</p>
