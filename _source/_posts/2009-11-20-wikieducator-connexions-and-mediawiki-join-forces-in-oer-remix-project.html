<p>In case you haven't heard, <a href="http://wikieducator.org/">WikiEducator</a>'s Wayne Mackintosh <a href="http://groups.google.co.nz/group/wikieducator/browse_frm/thread/1590af1fb5f019f0">announced</a> earlier this week that they were joining forces with <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a> "to provide educators with greater freedom of choice to mix and match the best of two OER worlds, namely "producer-consumer" models with more traditional work flow approaches and commons-based peer production." WikiEducator and Connexions are two collaborative OER projects that use Creative Commons licenses. While WikiEducator, licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, focuses "on building capacity in the use of Mediawiki and related free software technologies for mass-collaboration in the authoring of free content," Connexions, licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>, focuses on the collaborative development, sharing, and publishing of modular educational content that can be easily integrated into larger collections or courses. According to the announcement, the two projects will partner "to build import export capability between the Connexions and WikiEducator/Mediawiki platforms."</p>
<p>It's definitely exciting to see these two OER projects <a href="http://wikieducator.org/CNX-WE">working together</a>, especially since the collaboration is being generously funded by a grant from one of our own biggest supporters, <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/oer">the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>. There are various ways you can tune into its progress, including visiting the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/CNX-WE">project planning node</a>, subscribing to the <a href="http://groups.google.co.nz/group/connexions-community">Connexions mailing list</a>, or helping them develop <a href="http://wikieducator.org/CNX-WE/Project_plan">use case scenarios</a>. </p>
