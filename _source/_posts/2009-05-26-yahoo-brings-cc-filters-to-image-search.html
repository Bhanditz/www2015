<p>Forgive me, but a picture (screen shot) is worth a thousand words (searches):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/2009/05/26/find-images-to-use-and-reuse-with-the-new-creative-commons-filter/"><img src="img/3566427067_f3153b2e8c.jpg" alt="Yahoo Image Search" title="Yahoo Image Search" width="500" height="253" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14715" /></a></p>
<p>Today, on <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/">Yahoo's Search Blog</a>, Polly Ng and Anuj Sahai <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/2009/05/26/find-images-to-use-and-reuse-with-the-new-creative-commons-filter/">announced the addition of CC license image filtering options to their image search and also explained why CC licenses are so important for finding images online</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finding a great image online elicits a little thrill, but it can be tricky - if youâ€™re looking for a pic to pop into a presentation or illustrate a Web page, you need to know if youâ€™re allowed to use that photo, and how you can use it. Today, Yahoo! Image Search is launching a Creative Commons license filter that allows you to simply and quickly find images that are available for reuse.</p>
<p>When you use Yahoo! Image Search, youâ€™ll now see a checkbox for Creative Commons allowing you to filter for images from Flickr that can be used commercially or that can be modified (remixed, tweaked, or built upon) with restrictions set by the imageâ€™s creator.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats to the Yahoo! team for extending CC <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/09/searchmonkey_support_for_rdfa_enabled.html">even further into their platform</a>!</p>
