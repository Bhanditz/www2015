<p><a href="http://www.jahtari.org/">Jahtari</a> is a German dub/reggae web label that releases the majority of their music under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/de/">BY-NC-ND license</a>. Specializing in what they call <a href="http://www.jahtari.org/main/theory.htm">Digital Laptop Reggae</a>, Jahtari focus on the collision between the free form aesthetics and rhythm of dub/reggae music and the inelastic nature of computer based electronica. Both stylistic movements focus heavily on experimental production techniques, providing a unique starting point for Jahtari's artists to begin genre bending. Make sure to check out <a href="http://www.jahtari.org/artists.htm">their vast catalog</a> - the music is as interesting as it sounds.</p>
