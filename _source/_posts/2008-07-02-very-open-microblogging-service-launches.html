<p><a href="http://identi.ca">Identi.ca</a>, an <a href="http://identi.ca/doc/source">open source/free software</a> + <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">open content</a> = <a href="http://opendefinition.org/osd">open service</a> microblogging service launched today. From the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>How is Identi.ca different from Twitter, Jaiku, Pownce, Plurk, others?</b></p>
<p>Identi.ca is an <a href="http://opendefinition.org/osd">Open Network Service</a>. Our main goal is to provide a fair and transparent service that preserves users' autonomy. In particular, all the software used for Identi.ca is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software">Free Software</a>, and all the data is available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0</a> license, making it Open Data.</p>
<p>The software also implements the <a href="http://openmicroblogging.org/">OpenMicroBlogging</a> protocol, meaning that you can have friends on other microblogging services that can receive your notices.</p>
<p>The goal here is <em>autonomy</em> -- you deserve the right to manage your own on-line presence. If you don't like how Identi.ca works, you can take your data and the source code and set up your own server (or move your account to another one).</p>

<p>Creative Commons' <a href="http://identi.ca/rejon">Jon Phillips</a> is quoted in the <a href="http://controlezvous.ca/?p=5">press release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Response from initial testers has been enthusiastic, both for the softwareâ€™s design and functionality, as well as the siteâ€™s openness. â€œIt makes me feel alive again to see the resurgence of free/open on the web,â€ said Jon Phillips, Community Manager with Creative Commons in San Francisco, CA.</p></blockquote>
