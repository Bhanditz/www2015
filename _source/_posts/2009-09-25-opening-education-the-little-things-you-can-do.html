<p>By now, you've heard and/or used the term OER (Open Educational Resources) a ton of times. Whether you're an advocate for open education, promoting the use, reuse, and adaptation of openly licensed educational materials, or an <strong>everyday user of them</strong> because you find them convenient and effective for your teaching or learning needs, you have contributed in some way to improving the educational landscape for everyone, everywhere. </p>
<p>But there's a lot of little things you can do to improve education and the educational process no matter who you are and where you're located. These are things you do all the time as part of your professional or personal routines, such as filling out forms about your job or project, writing up summaries or abstracts on papers you've researched, or describing and tagging photos (aka adding metadata). These activities are also integral to the functioning of many open education projects, which depend on efforts from online communities consisting of persons like ourselves. A list of these projects are growing on <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Volunteer">OpenEd's volunteer page</a>, which currently points to projects like dScribe and AcaWiki. If your project could use help on a specific activity, please add it here! <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/">OpenEd</a> is a wiki; anyone can edit.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://open.umich.edu/blog/2009/09/24/we-created-over-200-images/">dScribe needs descriptions for their medical images</a></strong><br />
dScribe has created over 200 images to aid instructors in their teaching, but they need to be made discoverable first! You can help by adding tags and short descriptions for one or two images. All images and their accompanying info will be licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://acawiki.org/Home">AcaWiki could use those summaries and abstracts you've written</a></strong><br />
AcaWiki makes summaries and literature reviews of peer-reviewed academic research available to the general public via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, allowing people like us to easily find desired information. If you've written summaries and reviews for papers before, now's the time to make them useful by uploading those files to AcaWiki. And if you regularly research and write up abstracts for class or for your own good, you can easily make uploading them a habitual part of the process. It only takes a couple of extra clicks. </p>
<p>We also encourage you to add your project or organization to <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/ODEPO">ODEPO</a>, ccLearn's Open Database of Educational Projects and Organizations. Not only will this make your project more discoverable, it will enable better research across the landscape of open education related projects.</p>
