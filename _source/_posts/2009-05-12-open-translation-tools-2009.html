<p>One of the social barriers to wide adoption of educational resources is the availability of them in various countries' native languages. When educational resources are licensed openly, sans the ND term, this barrier is easily overcome via translation practices. However, a lot of issues still remain even with OER at hand to be freely translated, such as stream-lining translation processes, exploring tools that aid in translation, and seeking the best ways to distribute such translations. </p>
<p>To address these issues and more, FLOSSManuals.net and Translate.org.za, with generous support by the Open Society Institute, are putting on <a href="http://www.aspirationtech.org/events/opentranslation/2009">Open Translation Tools 2009</a>, a conference that,</p>
<blockquote><p>"...will convene stakeholders in the field of open content translation to assess the state of software tools that support translation of content that is licensed under free or open content licenses such as Creative Commons or Free Document License. The event will serve to map out whatâ€™s available, whatâ€™s missing, whoâ€™s doing what, and to recommend strategic next steps to address those needs, with a particular focus on delivering value to open education, open knowledge, and human rights blogging communities.</p>
<p>... â€œOpen contentâ€ will encompass a range of resource types, from educational materials to books to manuals to documents to blog content to video and multimedia."</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the agenda items is "Addressing the Translation Challenges Faced by the Open Education, Open Content, and human rights blogging communities, and mapping requirements to available open solutions." ccLearn's Ahrash Bissell will be in attendance, having helped to shape the vision for the event.</p>
<p>Open Translation Tools 2009 will take place in lovely Amsterdam from June 22-24. They are currently <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/300/event/index.jsp?event_KEY=49120">calling for participants</a> and do not require a registration fee (though donations are requested). Limited scholarships are also available. </p>
