<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/freebassel">We've written several times</a> on this blog about <a href="http://freebassel.org/">Bassel Khartabil</a>, the Syrian Creative Commons community leader who's been imprisoned since March 2012 without having had any charges brought against him.</p>
<p>European Parliament members Charles Tannock and Ana Gomes recently <a href="http://freebassel.org/campaign/statements/2013/12/10/eu-parliament/">submitted an official question to the Parliament leadership</a> concerning Bassel's imprisonment:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Is the VP/HR aware of the ongoing imprisonment of Bassel Safadi Khartabil? If so, has she issued any public statement on the matter?</li>
<li>Does she agree that this represents a further abuse by the Assad regime in its attempts to block the free spread of information?</li>
<li>Will the VP/HR use the leverage available to her to press for his release, insisting upon his status as a non-combatant whose only crime has been to oppose censorship and promote the freedom of information?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kikisurvives">Our friend Niki Korth</a> recently created <a href="http://lettersforbassel.tumblr.com/">Letters for Bassel</a>, a blog that collects letters to Bassel from friends or people who've been inspired by his story. <a href="http://lettersforbassel.tumblr.com/post/72675653875/happy-anniversary-to-bassel-and-noura-and-may-you">She recently published this heartbreaking letter</a> that Bassel wrote to his wife Noura on their first anniversary:</p>

<p><a href="/weblog/entry/37414">As Cathy wrote in her piece on Bassel for Huffington Post</a>, "For Bassel and others around the world who fight for open, a free internet is not a theoretical matter. Real lives hang in the balance." Creative Commons' wish for 2014 is for Bassel to be freed and rejoin our community.</p>
