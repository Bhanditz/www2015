<p>ccLearn is a participating member of the program committee for the upcoming conference on <a href="http://cfp2008.org/">COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, AND PRIVACY: TECHNOLOGY POLICY '08</a>, to be held May 20-23, 2008 in New Haven, CT.</p>
<p>The conference covers many different themes, including a few near and dear to the heart of Creative Commons, such as social networks, digital education, copyright and fair-use, open access, and more. We encourage you to consider submitting a proposal and attending the conference! But act fast, deadline for most proposal submissions is in less than two weeks.</p>
