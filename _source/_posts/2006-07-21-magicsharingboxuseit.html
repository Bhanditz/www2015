<p>Canadian author MCM has created a <a href="http://dustrunners.blogspot.com/2006/07/pig-and-box.html">kid's storybook and fable for the commons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The Pig and the Box</i> is about a pig who finds a magic box that can replicate anything you put into it.  The pig becomes so protective of it, and so suspicious of anyone that wants to use it, that he makes people take their copied items home in special buckets that act as... well, they're basically DRM.  It's like a fable, except the moral of the story is very modern in tone.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book is licensed under the CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 Canada</a> license <em>and</em> published the sources -- the book has already been translated into Chinese, Danish, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.  A <a href="http://www.dustrunners.com/Pig_and_the_Box_BW.pdf">colouring book</a> version is also available.</p>
<p>MCM has pledged <a href="http://dustrunners.blogspot.com/2006/07/free-pig.html">free the pig from its repressive NonCommercial chains</a> and release the book under the truly free (as defined by free software activists) <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ca/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license -- if he can raise $2000.  Patrons who pledge $20 toward the cause will get a signed copy of the book.</p>
