<p>Just a reminder that <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC Salon</a> is happening tonight from 6-9pm at <a href="http://shinesf.com/">Shine</a> in San Francisco. CC Salon is a free, casual monthly get-together focused on conversation, networking, and presentations from people or groups who are developing projects that relate to open content and tools. CC Salon SF is now being presented in conjunction with <a href="http://www.copynight.org/">CopyNight</a> SF.</p>
<p>This month's line-up of speakers includes Hemai Parthasarathy and Barbara Cohen of the <a href="http://plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a>, Owen Byrne of <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>, and John Buckman of <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>. Shannon Coulter will be DJing a set of CC music from Magnatune's catalogue.</p>
