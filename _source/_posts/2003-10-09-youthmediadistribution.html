Youth Media Distribution is a project that aims to improve the distribution of independent youth created film, video, radio and new media. They offer a variety of tools for young people making films, including hosting on their site and promotion through film festivals. Recently they've added the option of choosing a Creative Commons license when uploading a film. They've even created <a href="http://www.ymdi.org/media/browse_media_cc.php">a special page listing all the entries released under a license</a>,</p>

The YMDI project is an offshot of <a href="http://www.mediarights.org/">MediaRights.org</a>, a non-profit organization that helps people locate and use documentary films that focus on social issues.</p>
