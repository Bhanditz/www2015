At April's <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/San_Francisco_Salon">CC Salon SF</a>, we will hear from three presenters showcasing their innovative international ventures and discussing how CC licenses can be used in international projects to facilitate content sharing and connectivity across borders:</p>
<p>* Miquel Hudin Balsa,  Co-Founder of <a href="http://www.maneno.org">Maneno</a>, a blogging and communication platform built to meet the needs of the Sub-Saharan blogger and writer.</p>
<p>* David Harris, Executive Director of <a href="http://globallives.org">Global Lives Project</a>, an international collaboration of filmmakers, designers, architects, activists, and institutions to chronicle 24 hours in the life of ten individuals from around the globe, forming an innovative video installation and collaborative online video encyclopedia.</p>
<p>
<p>* Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee, Founder and Director of <a href="http://globaloneness.org">Global Oneness Project</a>, which seeks to explore how the radically simple notion of interconnectedness can be lived in our increasingly complex world by creating a "living library" of films chronicling the courageous lives of people passionate about sustainability, conflict resolution, spirituality, art, economics, indigenous culture, and social justice.</p>
<p>
We're delighted to have our friends over at <a href="http://parisoma.com">PariSoMa</a> host us for the second time in their lovely and inviting space (<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=1436+howard+st+san+francisco&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=de&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=image">map and directions</a>). Plenty of street parking is available. Please note, the space is located up two steep flights of stairs, and unfortunately does not currently have elevator access.</p>
<p>Light refreshments will be provided, and since we rely on the generosity of our community to keep us afloat, weâ€™ll be accepting donations for CC at the door. </p>
