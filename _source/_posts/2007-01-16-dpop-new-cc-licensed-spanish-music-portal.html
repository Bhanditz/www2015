<p>Check out <a href="http://dpop.es">dpop</a>, a cool new music portal featuring CC-licensed podcasts and songs by Spanish pop groups. The site is really easy to navigate and features lots of great mp3 downloads from acts working in various styles of rock and electronic music.</p>
<p>From dpop's site:</p>
<blockquote><p>dpop is an independent platform to promote spanish artists supporting free culture, and licensing their pop creations under a Creative Commons license or any copyleft license.</p></blockquote>
