<p>One of the kings of scientific publishing, the journal <a href="http://www.nature.com/">Nature</a>, has <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/">recently launched a forum</a> to bring together articles and information about open access publishing. They've even got <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/rss.rdf">an RSS feed</a> for updates to the forum.</p>
<p>It's great to see a top journal open a dialogue about a somewhat controversial issue in the scientific publishing industry. In an age of ever increasing journal subscription costs and shrinking library budgets, many smaller journals have embraced the concept of <a href="http://www.doaj.org/">open access publishing</a> and <a href="http://plos.org/">a prominent journal</a> started with the issue at heart, but many larger publishers have distanced themselves from the topic.
