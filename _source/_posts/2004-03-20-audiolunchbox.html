Although they're not selling any Creative Commons licensed music, it's worth noting that there's a new player in the downloadable music arena: <a href="http://audiolunchbox.com/">Audio Lunchbox</a>. They specialize in small indie rock labels, selling albums for around ten dollars each in instantly available downloadable formats. Additionally, the high bitrate MP3 and ogg vorbis tracks contain no DRM of any kind; just unencumbered music.</p>
