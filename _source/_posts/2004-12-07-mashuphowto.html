<p>Making music mash-ups (combining two songs, layered one over the other) is relatively easy for those in the know when compared with recording your own tracks, but it's not always easy to pick up an audio application and understand the ins and outs of it. While <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5062">some have called for tutorials</a> to help music fans get up to speed, one person has answered the call, publishing <a href="http://www.paintingbynumbers.com/bootcamp/">this detailed step-by-step mash-up tutorial</a> for using the software package <a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion/">Tracktion</a>. The article is fairly specialized, tailored to Tracktion, but there are basics that could be applied to other audio applications as well.</p>
