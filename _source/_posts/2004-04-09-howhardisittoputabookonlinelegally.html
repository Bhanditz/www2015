<p>Sometimes people ask us why we created the Creative Commons, and we often say that we wanted there to be an easy way for you to share your creations and also to build a large pool of creative work that is easy to redistribute, print, (and if the license allows) collage, remix, or even sell to others.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what the world without Creative Commons is like, check out this helpful primer on the question "<a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/okbooks.html">How Can I Tell Whether a Book Can Go Online?</a>" The answer, as you can see, is quite complicated, including the various laws around the world. The page doesn't mention CC, but if it did, one of the top bullets would be "look for a Creative Commons mark" and the permission and legal questions that take up the rest of the page would be solved.</p>
