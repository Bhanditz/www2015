<p>Creative Commons introduces its innovative copyright licenses at the Free  Culture Festival in Zagreb</p>
<p>San Francisco, USA and Zagreb, CROATIA ï£§ Jan. 19, 2005 ï£§ Creative  Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides a flexible copyright for authors and artists, this week unveiled a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Croatia. The Creative Commons licenses afford authors and  publishers an intermediate degree of protection over their photos, music, text, films, and educational materials under a â€œsome rights reservedâ€ copyright, in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reserved.â€</p>
<p>With the announcement, Creative Commons now offers free legal tools in a total of fourteen country-specific versions. The organization already provides copyright licenses specific to Austrian, Belgian, Brazilian, Dutch, Finnish,  French, German, Italian, Japanese, U.S., Taiwanese, Canadian and Spanish law, thanks to a global network of artists, lawyers, and technologists.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™s offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with project leads Tomislav Medak and Diane Kovaeeviae Remenariae of the Multimedia Institute (mi2), Zagreb, to adapt the standardized licenses for use  under Croatian law.</p>
<p>Medak said, â€œIn Croatia there was a powerful grass-roots free culture  movement even before we started transposing the licenses into Croatian law. We hope to be able to build on the festivalâ€™s momentum to promote rapid license uptake.â€</p>
<p>Creative Commons released the new legal tools, which are available free of charge from the Creative Commons website, at the Free Culture Festival in Zagreb, which featured an exhibition, various lectures, and a two-day concert  that brought together representatives of the burgeoning local music scene and British artists from Loca Records. Lawrence Lessig, professor of law at Stanford University and chairman of Creative Commons, delivered a keynote speech at  the festival.</p>
<p>â€œMany thanks to Diane and Tomislav for their terrific work,â€ says Glenn Otis  Brown, Executive Director of Creative Commons. â€œThe organizationâ€™s tremendous international growth is due entirely to our network of top-notch experts and volunteers worldwide. â€</p>
<p>The continued global expansion of Creative Commons is one of the main priorities of the San Francisco-based organization for 2005.</p>
