<p>Looking for a new way to search for CC licensed photos? We've just been informed about a <a href="http://color.slightlyblue.com/">tool</a> that searches <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> for CC licensed content based on their color hue and saturation. Now you can easily puruse the millions of CC licensed photos based on all your color palette needs.</p>
