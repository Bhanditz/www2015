<p>Happy Belated Birthday <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_milton">John Milton</a>! The poet that English majors belabor and grow to know so well turned 400 earlier this week, and to celebrate, the <a href="http://www.okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> launched <a href="http://www.openmilton.org/">Open Milton</a>. What is Open Milton?</p>
<p>Open Milton is "an open set of Milton's works, together with ancillaryÂ information and tools, in a form designed for reuse.Â The Open Milton project has two main objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide the works of John Milton, along with textual apparatus andÂ tools all in an open form.</li>
<li>Deliver this material as a knowledge package that allows for easyÂ deployment, redistribution and reuse.Â </li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically [they] provide a full open set of Milton's works along withÂ ancillary material, a variety of tools and a python API. In additionÂ to the works themselves there is a chronology, statistics, aÂ concordance and search facilities."</p>
<p>The great thing about Open Milton is that it is a specialized resource, organized and pieced together in novel and thoughtful ways---but it doesn't prevent you or anyone else from tinkering with it, adding to it, and making it better. Why? Because it's <a href="http://www.openmilton.org/about">licensed</a> under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">CC BY</a> and therefore discoverable (machine-readable), even if it doesn't conform to some aggregator's notion of a proper resource.Â Open Milton is an excellent example for self-publishing; anyone can give their work the advantage of open licensing.</p>
