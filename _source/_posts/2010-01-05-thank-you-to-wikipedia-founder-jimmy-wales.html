<p>Wikipedia <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/19993">also</a> wrapped up a wildly successful fundraiser at the end of the year. See below for Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales' <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Jimmy_Thank_You/en#appeal">thank you letter</a> to the community, reproduced in full under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, the license Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411">migrated to last June</a>. Note "support our friends" at the end -- it is a great honor for CC to be in such esteemed company!<br />
<blockquote>Wow.  What can I say?  Thank you.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve just ended the most successful fundraiser in our history, $7.5 million USD raised in less than 8 weeks.</p>
<p>Incredible. But Iâ€™m not surprised.</p>
<p>In 2001, I took a bet on people, and youâ€™ve never let me down.</p>
<p>You have created the largest collection of human knowledge ever assembled: 14 million encyclopedia articles in 270 languages, still growing and getting better every day. You have supported, funded and protected it.</p>
<p>Advertising doesnâ€™t pay for Wikipedia. You do. Wikipedia is the fifth most visited website on earth â€“ 340 million people last month â€“ and we run our servers and pay our lean staff entirely with donations.</p>
<p>Your donations keep Wikipedia free to use and free of ads. Your donations keep spreading free access to knowledge all across the earth.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you give to make Wikipedia a reality.  Iâ€™ve been inspired by your comments, and feel privileged to witness your passion for Wikipedia.</p>
