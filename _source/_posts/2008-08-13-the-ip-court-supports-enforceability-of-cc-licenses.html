<p class="western"><span style="Trebuchet MS;">The United States Court of Appeals held that "Open Source" or public license licensors are entitled to copyright infringement relief.</span></p>
<p style="Trebuchet MS;">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), the leading IP court in the United States, has upheld a free copyright license, while explicitly pointing to the work of Creative Commons and others. The Court held that free licenses such as the CC licenses set conditions (rather than covenants) on the use of copyrighted work. Â As a result, licensors using public licenses are able to seek injunctive relief for alleged copyright infringement, rather than being limited to traditional contract remedies.</p>
<p style="Trebuchet MS;">Creative Commons founder <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> explained the theory of all free software, open source, and Creative Commons licenses upheld by the court: "When you violate the condition, the license disappears, meaning you're simply a copyright infringer. This is the theory of the GPL and all CC licenses. Put precisely, whether or not they are also contracts, they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license." Lessig said the ruling provided "important clarity and certainty by a critically important US Court."</p>
<p style="Trebuchet MS;">Today's ruling vacated the district court's decision and affirmed the availability of remedies based on copyright law for violations of open licenses. Â The federal court noted that ignoring attribution requirements contained in the license caused reputation and economic harm to the original licensor. This opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principles of the internet; attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy.Â  <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/082002.pdf">Read the full opinion</a>.(PDF)</p>
