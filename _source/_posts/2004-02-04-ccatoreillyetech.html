<p>Creative Commons will be an <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/28/exhibitors.html">exhibitor</a> at  the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference</a> in San Diego next week.</p>
<p>Etech is regarded by many as the best tech conference of the year, always in step with the latest creations and aspirations of the alpha geeks, having <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/archive.csp">evolved</a> from the Peer-to-Peer Conference in early 2001 and P2P & Web Services in late 2001 to the current multi-tracked annual conference starting two years ago. (Incidentally, the Creative Commons concept was <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2002/view/e_sess/2376">introduced</a> at ETCon 2002. How time flies.)</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#14">Matt Haughey</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#21">Mike Linksvayer</a> will be attending.  Stop by the Creative Commons booth, or better yet our <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/etech/view?ParticipantSessions">participant session</a> (time and location yet to be announced).  We'll be introducing a new CC metadata-enhanced application.  Hint: it's described in one of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/challenges">tech challenges</a>, heretofore unmet.</p>
<p>If you're in the area but not an attendee, you can still <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/create/ord_et04">register</a> for a free exhibits pass, or an exhibits plus keynotes and birds-of-a-feather (participant sessions) pass for only $50.  Hope to see you there!</p>
