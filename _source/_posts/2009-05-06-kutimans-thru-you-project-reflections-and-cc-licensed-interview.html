<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14406" title="thruyou" src="img/thruyou.jpg" alt="thruyou" width="350" height="68" />If you're interested in online culture, you've probably come across the amazing <em><a href="http://thru-you.com/">THRU YOU</a></em> project from Israeli producer <a href="http://www.myspace.com/kutiman">Kutiman</a> (see this <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/03/kutimans-pionee/">WIRED profile</a> for some background). Kutiman mashed together various YouTube clips of people playing instruments (many of them instructional videos) to create something totally new and unique. The result was a collection of <a href="http://thru-you.com/#/videos/">seven songs and videos</a> that artfully demonstrate the potential of digital collaboration.</p>
<p>Last month, CBC Radio's <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/spark/">Spark</a> talked to Kutiman about the project and posted the interview audio posted to ccMixter under a Creative Commons BY-NC license for producers to chop up and use in their own tracks. <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/sparkcbc/20126">Check it out!</a></p>
