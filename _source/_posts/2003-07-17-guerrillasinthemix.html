<p>There's a good, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,59657,00.html">brief article</a> in Wired News today on the importance of digital editing tools to the underground film movement.</p>
<blockquote><p>They describe themselves as "guerrilla filmmakers," independent directors who create for both fun and profit, and they see themselves as a resistance force battling the banality of mainstream movies.</p>
<p>"There's a world full of weird and important stories to tell, so I'm not sitting around waiting for scripts or budgets to be approved," said filmmaker Laszlo Balogh. "I roll my own movies."</p>
</blockquote>
