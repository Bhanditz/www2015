<p>Erik MÃ¶ller of the Wikimedia Foundation <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2008-December/048213.html">announced</a> a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Questions_and_Answers">questions and answers document</a> concerning the possible licensing update for Wikimedia Foundation projects to CC BY-SA. On "What will happen next?"<br />
<blockquote>We will present a proposal for dual-licensing all Wikimedia projects currently using the GFDL, by January 15, 2009. It will be published on the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation-l">foundation-l</a> mailing list. This proposal will be discussed and revised through open community discussion, leading to an open vote among all active Wikimedia contributors (to be defined using similar criteria as the Board elections). If a majority of community members favor migration to CC-BY-SA, it will be implemented.</p></blockquote>
<p>This follows the enormously important November 3 move by the Free Software Foundation to enable FDL-licensed wikis to migrate to CC BY-SA. For more background and why this is so important for free culture, see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10443">our post on the FSF's move</a>.</p>
<p>FSF president and free software movement founder Richard Stallman has since <a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/2008-12-fdl-open-letter">written an open letter on the matter</a>. Excerpt:<br />
<blockquote>If a wiki site exercises the relicensing option, that entails trusting Creative Commons rather than the Free Software Foundation regarding its future license changes. In theory one might consider this a matter of concern, but I think we can be confident that Creative Commons will follow its stated mission in the maintenance of its licenses. Millions of users trust Creative Commons for this, and I think we can do likewise.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great honor for Creative Commons, and a debt of trust we are compelled to uphold. We hope the Wikimedia community will come to the same conclusion. Regarding maintenance of CC BY-SA licenses, see our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8213">Statement of Intent</a>, also cited by the Q&A linked at the top of this post.</p>
<p>For a more general take on license stewardship, please see Bradley Kuhn's post on <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/blog/2008/dec/04/license-drafting-responsibility/">The FLOSS License Drafter's Responsibility to the Community</a>, prompted by Stallman's letter:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The key quote from his letter that stands out to me is: "our commitment is that our changes to a license will stick to the spirit of that license, and will uphold the purposes for which we wrote it." This point is fundamental. As FLOSS license drafters, we must always, as RMS says, "abide by the highest ethical standards" to uphold the spirit that spurred the creation of these licenses.</p>
<p>Far from being annoyed, I'm grateful for those who assume the worst of intentions and demand that we justify ourselves. For my part, I try to answer every question I get at conferences and in email about licensing policy as best I can with this point in mind. We in the non-profit licensing sector of the FLOSS world have a duty to the community of FLOSS users and programmers to defend their software freedom. I try to make every decision, on licensing policy (or, indeed, any issue) with that goal in mind. I know that my colleagues here at the SFLC, at the <a href="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Conservancy</a>, at FSF, and at the many other not-for-profit organizations always do the same, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CC does not create software licenses (we recommend existing excellent free software licenses, such as the FSF's GNU GPL), but these are words to take to heart as closely as possible.</p>
