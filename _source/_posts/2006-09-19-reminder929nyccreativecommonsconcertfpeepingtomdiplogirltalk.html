The show will feature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Patton">Mike Patton</a>'s experimental pop supergroup <a href="http://www.myspace.com/peepingtomispatton">Peeping Tom</a>, DJ/producer <a href="http://www.myspace.com/diplo">Diplo</a>, and mash-up/remix artist <a href="http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic">Girl Talk</a>. Creative Commons' CEO Lawrence Lessig will be on hand to introduce the artists.</p>
<p>This concert is a great way to show your support for our work, as proceeds from all ticket sales will go directly to Creative Commons (please note that ticket price is *not* tax-deductible).
