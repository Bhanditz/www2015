<p><a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> is a new open source vector graphics editor, specializing in the SVG format. In the past, vector illustration applications have been limited to a few expensive choices, so it's great to see an open source project tackle an open format. As an added bonus, Inkscape even supports <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/usingmarkup">our metadata</a> and does fine opening up the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/presskit/">svg files in our presskit</a>. Currently it's available for windows and linux, hopefully a os x client is soon to follow.</p>
