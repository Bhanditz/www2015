<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12778">we posted about Facebook's recent Terms of Service ordeal and how it demonstrates the need for human readable legal deeds</a>. Now, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=54746167130">is asking the Facebook community for feedback on a Facebook Bill of Rights</a>. We think this is a great opportunity for you, our community, to let Facebook know how the social network should use and license your content. </p>
<p>Do you think Facebook should support CC licensing options for user photos and other content? Now is the time to let them know. As of this post, the official group "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=69048030774">Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities</a>" has almost 75,000 members and 800 topics on the discussion board, so don't hesitate to make sure your voice gets heard. Also, relevant is Miguel Barrera Maureira's group "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=55178542061">Why not include Creative Commons in Facebook TOS?</a>"</p>
