<p>From last week's episode:</p>
<p>Thus we use our licenses to build the freedoms authors want upon a<br />
reinforced layer of "fair use" freedoms. Creative Commons is thus<br />
"fair use"-plus: a promise that any freedoms given are always in<br />
addition to the freedoms guaranteed by the law.</p>
<p>That's the end of the background. Next week I will describe some of<br />
the fun stuff Creative Commons has built, and some more about where<br />
we're going.</p>
<p>The story continues:</p>
<p>About two months ago, a friend asked:</p>
<p>"I don't get what Creative Commons is, beyond a bunch of servers<br />
serving up licenses to people around the world. Why would you need<br />
support?"</p>
<p>The question was completely understandable. Most who see us just see<br />
us through our licenses. Yet there's a great deal more to what we're<br />
doing. And my aim over the next few weeks is to describe that great<br />
deal more.</p>
<p>This email is just a start (I promised to keep these short). Its aim<br />
is to describe the initial core of CC.</p>
<p>When Creative Commons was launched in December, 2002, we had a<br />
simple, narrow focus â€” to spread Creative Commons licenses. The<br />
organization was housed in the basement of Stanford Law School. The<br />
tiny staff worked so hard that some at Stanford thought they lived<br />
there too.</p>
<p>The aim at the time was straightforward: to explain why Creative<br />
Commons licenses mattered. We did that with lectures, with stories<br />
for the press, and even with Flash: <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/getcreative/clicktoplay.html">http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/getcreative/clicktoplay.html</a></p>
<p>Slowly, we found traction. MIT's OpenCourseWare project used CC<br />
licenses to free an extraordinary range of content for anyone to<br />
build upon or share. Rice University's Connexions project did the<br />
same. And Tim O'Reilly gave us over 500 titles from O'Reilly Press to<br />
release under free licenses, including some under a license (the<br />
Founders' Copyright) that voluntarily reduces the term of copyright<br />
to just 14 (or 28) years.</p>
<p>Very soon into the project, we started getting emails from around the<br />
world asking how others in other countries could participate too.<br />
Technically, our licenses were designed to work anywhere in the<br />
world. But this enthusiasm went far beyond the desire to adopt US-<br />
based licenses.</p>
<p>So early on we launched the "iCommons Project." Headquartered in<br />
Berlin, the initial aim of the iCommons Project was to coordinate<br />
with volunteers from around the world to develop versions of our<br />
licenses that were tuned to the law of local jurisdictions. Japan was<br />
the first, developing a license based in Japanese law that could also<br />
be used anywhere in the world. These localized licenses would then<br />
link to a translated "Commons Deed" (remember, the simple plain<br />
English (and now, plain-Japanese, Spanish, French, etcâ€¦) explanation<br />
of the license), and then to a universal set of metadata that would<br />
make the freedoms attached to the content understandable by computers.</p>

<p>iCommons quickly exploded. Soon we had volunteers from over 70<br />
countries around the world interested in porting our licenses to<br />
their local law. And as countries completed the project, I began<br />
trekking across the world to celebrate the launch of Creative Commons<br />
internationally. With Slovenia's launch this last weekend, there are<br />
now 24 jurisdictions that have gone live. And a bunch more will<br />
become live very soon.</p>
<p>This is the core of what CC has been â€” making free licenses work<br />
wherever we can. But that's just the beginning of the work we've<br />
done. Next, we'll describe the Science Commons. And after that,<br />
another major new international project.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>One final fundraising related bit of news: As you know, I'm writing<br />
these letters as part of our annual fundraising campaign. This letter<br />
might begin to help you see why such a campaign is needed. But I<br />
wanted to tell you about a new feature to this campaign: We're asking<br />
our supporters to add a Creative Commons button to their site, to<br />
help grow the Commoners Movement. Please support us by adding a<br />
button to any page you might control. You can get the button here:</p>
