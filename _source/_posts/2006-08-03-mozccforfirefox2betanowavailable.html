<p>Development work on <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox2">Firefox 2</a> is moving along, and the Mozilla team has released the first beta.  While in San Francisco this week I've spent some time hacking on a new MozCC 2 codebase, and we're happy to announce the availability of MozCC 2.  Just a few notes about the release.  First, download links and installation instructions are available <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/MozCC">in the wiki</a>, of course.  Second, this release <em>only</em> supports the Firefox 2.0 beta (Bon Echo to those in the know).  Finally, running the Firefox 2 beta isn't for everyone: see the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bonecho/all-beta.html">download page at mozilla.org</a> for details on what you can expect.</p>
<p>That said, if you are testing Firefox 2 and enjoy MozCC in your previous version, try this out and let us know what you think.</p>
