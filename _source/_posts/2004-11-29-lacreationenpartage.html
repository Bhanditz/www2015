<p>CC French project lead Melanie Dulong de Rosnay and Daniele Bourcier<br />
have just published '<a href="http://fr.creativecommons.org/iCommonsAtTheDigitalAge.pdf">International Commons at the Digital Age - la creation en partage</a>', a book with<br />
some valuable chapters on our first experiences with the internationalized CC licenses.</p>
<p>The book was written as a contribution to a day-long event in Paris on<br />
November 19th to celebrate the launch of the French CC licenses.</p>
<p>For this occasion (photographs and some abstracts to follow in these<br />
pages) Melanie had organized several panels at the French National<br />
Assembly debating the merits of the CC approach from a variety of<br />
different perspectives (academia, the publishing industry, politics,<br />
science, the arts). The celebration continued into the wee hours at the<br />
Maison de Metallo in downtown Paris with live music acts, poetry<br />
readings, website presentations and fair trade drinks.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Melanie for all her enthusiasm and her splendid<br />
organization of this event.</p>
