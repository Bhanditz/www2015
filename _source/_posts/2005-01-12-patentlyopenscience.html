<p>MIT Technology Review just published an <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/01/wo/wo_delio011205.asp">article</a> that nicely ties together three related news items: <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002385.shtml">IBM's release</a> of 500 patents for use in open source developments, Bill Gates's "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/5223">communist</a>" screed, and <a href="http://science.creativecommons.org">Science Commons</a>.</p>
<p>The article misleads on one point:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Creative Commons licenses allow writers, artists and musicians to put their work into the public domain while still retaining some rights to how it is used and redistributed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Creators retain their copyright with a Creative Commons license. Dedication to the public domain is a separate option.  Here's what our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">choose a license</a> app says:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a Creative Commons license, <strong>you keep your copyright</strong> but allow people to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/fullrights">copy and distribute your work</a> provided they <a href="http://creativecommons.org/characteristic/by?lang=en" onclick="window.open('http://creativecommons.org/characteristic/by?lang=en', 'characteristic_help', 'width=375,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=yes,menubar=no,status=yes');return false;">give you credit</a> -- and only on the conditions you specify here. If you want to offer your work with no conditions, choose the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/publicdomain-2">public domain</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this quibble, the article is a good read, particularly if you (or a friend) haven't followed these recent events.  <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/01/wo/wo_delio011205.asp">Read it now.</a> We live in interesting times!</p>
