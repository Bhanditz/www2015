<p>Creative Commons would like to invite you to a breakfast discussion "Really Open Education. Domestic Policies for Open Educational Resources". The event will take place on the 18th of February 2014 and be hosted in the European Parliament by RÃ³Å¼a GrÃ¤fin von Thun und Hohenstein, MEP.</p>
<p>The event will highlight open education initiatives currently implemented in European member states, with a particular focus on primary and secondary education. With the event, we would like to draw the attention to the development and use Open Educational Resources as a key aspect of the new "Opening Up Education" initiative.</p>
<p>Invited panelists will present projects that deal with open e-textbooks and supplemental resources, repositories for open resources created by teachers, and policies developed in support of open education initiatives. We aim these examples to support the development of open education in Europe within the scope of current educational initiatives and programs, such as Erasmus+.</p>
