<p>Late last month we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20216">looked at</a> how our licenses were being used by both <a href="http://haiticrisis.appspot.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/updates/2010-01-17-haiti-quake-a-plan-for-reconstruction">Architecture for Humanity</a> to keep content open, free, and fluid in their Haiti Relief efforts.  As these efforts continue to grow more groups have turned to CC licenses to assist their goals, with three projects in particular catching our attention.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> project found an <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/Haiti-Open-Street-Map">immediate niche</a> to fill, launching their <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti">Project Haiti page</a> in an effort to map out what was, at the time, a largely incomplete geographical picture. Far more detailed now, OSM's <a href="http://labs.geofabrik.de/haiti/">data set</a> is available for free under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC Attribution-ShareAlike license</a>, helping those on the ground in Haiti get to where they need to be with greater accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="http://haitirewired.wired.com/">Haiti Rewired</a>, a project of WIRED magazine, is a collaborative community focused on tech and infrastructure solutions for Haiti. All the content published to Haiti Rewired is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC Attribution-Noncommercial license</a>, keeping the conversation legally open. You can read the project's <a href="http://haitirewired.wired.com/profiles/blogs/haiti-rewireds-mission">mission statement</a> for more info.</p>
<p>A similar effort comes from <a href="http://www.sahana.lk/">Sahana</a>, a free and open source software disaster management system. <a href="http://www.opensource.org/node/501'">Soon after the crisis hit</a>, Sahana launched their <a href="http://haiti-orgs.sahanafoundation.org/prod/">Haiti 2010 Disaster Relief Portal</a>, which includes an organizations registry, a situation map, and an activities report. All content and data from the portal is released under <a href="<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution license</a>, allowing necessary information to be accessed by anyone without legal or financial hurdles.</p>
