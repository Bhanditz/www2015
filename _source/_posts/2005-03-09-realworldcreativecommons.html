<p>London-based music business magazine <a href="http://www.fiveeight.net/">Five Eight</a> has published an article by <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a> founder John Buckman titled <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2005/03/cc_article_i_wr.html">Using the Creative Commons in the Real World</a> in which Buckman explains how he chose to use a CC license for his record label.</p>
<p>Also, Buckman in response to a <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2005/03/cc_article_i_wr.html#comments">question</a> on his blog regarding source material:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm in the process of consolidating all the various individual tracks we've received, to make a "remix sources" page at Magnatune, so you can easily find them all, and create new, interesting works.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep up the good work John!</p>
