<p>There's a whole lot that's cool about Wikitravel Press from business, community and licensing angles -- follow links from our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8016">previous post about it</a>.</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://wikitravelpress.com/pr/20080410">new <em>Paris</em> title</a> adds to the coolness by incorporating maps from <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, also under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license.</p>
<p>Also, this is a good time to mention that anyone thinking of similarly building a business around collaboratively built content is strongly recommended to absorb Wikitravel and Wikitravel Press cofounder Evan Prodromou's <a href="http://evan.prodromou.name/Talks/SXSW07">Commercialization of Wikis</a> presentation.</p>
