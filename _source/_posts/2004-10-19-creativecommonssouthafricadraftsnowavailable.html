<p>The innovative nonprofit pairs with<br />
South African experts to offer localized versions of its â€œsome rights<br />
reservedâ€ copyright licenses soon</p>
<p><span class="caps">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, USA <span class="caps">AND JOHANNESBURG</span>, SOUTH <span class="caps">AFRICA </span>â€”<br />
October 19, 2004â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a<br />
body of creative work free to share and build upon, announced today<br />
that South Africa is the latest country to join its international<br />
efforts. Creative Commons copyright licenses, which are available at no<br />
charge from the groupâ€™s website (<a href="http://creativecommons.org">http://creativecommons.org</a>),<br />
allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or<br />
transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€<br />
in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling<br />
others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal<br />
friction. South Africa joins twelve other nations in the draft phase of<br />
adapting the Creative Commons licenses; another nine nations already<br />
offer localized Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p>Led by the Johannesburg-based <span class="caps">LINK </span>Centre,<br />
Creative Commons South Africa plans to adapt the copyright licenses for<br />
use under South African law and to build local engagement with and use<br />
of Creative Commons-licensed content. Andrew Rens, a former lecturer at<br />
Wits University Law School, is leading the legal aspects of the project<br />
while Heather Ford, <span class="caps">LINK </span>Centre associate, directs the overall South African effort.</p>
<p>â€œSouth<br />
Africa is well-placed to pioneer developments in the field of<br />
intellectual property law,â€ said Ford. â€œThrough the Treatment Action<br />
Campaign we have had huge success in gaining access to cheaper <span class="caps">HIV</span>/AIDS drugs. More recently South Africa has helped to lead a â€˜development agendaâ€™ at <span class="caps">WIPO</span> which aims to use knowledge as a tool for empowerment, rather than to deepen existing divides.â€</p>
<p>Rens<br />
says that South Africaâ€™s innovative constitution has resulted in<br />
dramatic changes to many areas of law affecting the transmission of<br />
ideas including freedom of expression and access to information a<br />
development with potentially interesting consequences for the local<br />
enforcement of copyright laws.</p>
<p>South Africa offers unique<br />
opportunities and poses unique challenges for the Creative Commons<br />
model. Since the demise of apartheid, South Africa has emerged from<br />
global isolation as a model for democracy around the world. With one of<br />
the worldâ€™s most progressive constitutions and a Bill of Rights that<br />
stresses individual freedoms, it is also a leader in African policy<br />
development, and a champion for the causes of the developing world.<br />
South Africa is, nonetheless, still a divided society. A small,<br />
wealthy, relatively sophisticated population lives side by side with<br />
and a large, unskilled informal population. Only 4 million of the<br />
nationâ€™s 43 million residents are online.</p>
