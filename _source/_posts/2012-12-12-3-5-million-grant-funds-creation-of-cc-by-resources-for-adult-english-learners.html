<p>Just in time for <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons' 10th birthday celebration</a> of its license suite, the <a href="http://www.sbctc.ctc.edu">Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges</a> (SBCTC) <a href="http://www.sbctc.ctc.edu/general/documents/2012_12_06_I-DEA_grant_final.pdf">announced</a> a 3.5 million dollar grant from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a> for a new program -- Integrated Digital English Acceleration (I-DEA) -- that will help adult English language learners improve their language skills while simultaneously providing career and college readiness training through technology-based tools and resources.</p>
<p style="text-align:center" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" about="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2745/4079309979_d10b188084_z.jpg"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grahamstanley/4079309979/in/photostream/"><img src="img/4079309979_d10b188084_z.jpg" alt="cc10" border="0" /></a><br /><small>by <span property="dc:title"></span><span property="cc:attributionName">blogefl</span> / <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></small></p>
<p>The I-DEA program targets community college learners in the state's lowest three levels of English as a Second Language courses, and aims to help learners achieve their language goals in tandem with career goals -- with fewer hours of instruction than traditional programs that teach basic language skills separately from job-specific skills. </p>
<p>I-DEA derives its dual approach from the state's I-BEST model (Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training), which U.S. Department of Education Under Secretary Martha Kanter recognized as furthering adult education faster than any other program: "51 percent of I-BEST students completed a certificate in two years, vs. 14 percent of the comparison group..." (<a href="http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2011/May-June%202011/first-in-the-world-full.html">Change Magazine of Higher Learning</a>).</p>
<p>A significant part of this grant is that all online learning modules developed will be made available openly under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>, allowing anyone to access, reuse, translate, and remix the modules as long as attribution is given. I-DEA learning modules will be added to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/sbctc.edu/opencourselibrary/">Open Course Library</a>, Washington State's collection of high quality CC BY-licensed educational resources for its 82 highest enrolled community college courses. </p>
<p>The grant also includes the creation of new technology tools, laptop computers on loan, Internet access, and online advising and tutoring. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Among other goals, college and partner community-based organizations (CBOs) will create open source curriculum and identify best practices of technology-enhanced instruction that allow more students to be served with less in-class instruction. Courses and techniques developed with the grant will be open sourced, allowing colleges and CBOs in Washington and around the world to replicate I-DEA.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is fantastic news that couldn't come at a better time. Thank you for this birthday gift to CC! Thanks to the SBCTC for spearheading this initiative and to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for making it possible.</p>
