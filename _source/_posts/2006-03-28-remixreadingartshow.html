<p><a href="http://www.remixreading.org/">Remix Reading</a> is running an exhibition of Creative Commons-licensed art at <a href="http://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/galleries/blakes.htm">the Riverside Museum at Blake's Lock</a> in the UK from April 28th through 30th. There's an open call for submissions until April 6, so get to it! Remix Reading's <a href="http://tom.acrewoods.net/">Tom Chance</a> tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone can submit, and we'd especially like to receive "real media" submissions (i.e. not digital art or photographs). We can help arrange international shipping of works if anyone submits them.</p></blockquote>
