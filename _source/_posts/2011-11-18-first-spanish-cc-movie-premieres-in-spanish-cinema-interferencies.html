<p>Today, marks the premiere of the first Spanish movie under a CC license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>) in a Spanish cinema. <a href="http://www.interferencies.cc/">InterferÃ¨ncies</a>, "an audiovisual and educational project launched from the <a href="http://eng.odg.cat/">Debt Observatory</a> (ODG) and <a href="http://www.quepo.org/en/">Quepo</a>," premieres in Barcelona at both the Alexandra and Girona cinemas. InterferÃ¨ncies aims to educate and mobilize citizens, creating awareness of the world's current financial and social situation. CC Spain has also <a href="http://es.creativecommons.org/index.php/2011/11/16/primer-estreno-en-internet-y-en-salas-de-cine-de-pelicula-espanola-con-licencia-cc/">covered the event</a>, but here is the press release in English:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The project includes a film and website regarding the causes and alternatives of the global crisis, putting names to those responsible and addressing issues of today's debt crisis. The film comes from the need to disseminate the results of the research of a social entity; a task of dissemination that aims to create awareness of the existence of mechanisms and institutions inherent in the economic and political system in which we live, that impacts negatively on  the life of billions of people. InterferÃ¨ncies is the result of this anger and wishes to make accessible to the general public a new vision for understanding the reality around us.<br />
<br />
InterferÃ¨ncies arises as an open and shared project from its begining: through the participation and collaboration of more than 150 film professionals, audiovisual companies, social organizations and public institutions who contributed altruistically to make it grow, to the dissemination and distribution under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license</a>.<br />
<br />
The film is just the tip of an iceberg of a 2.0 comprehensive project which includes training and formal complaint dimensions, with a huge social transformation vocation. The project's website provides educational materials, topics, chapters and teaching proposals for individual and collective action. The aim is not leaving the users by themselves with their own reflections on the film, but giving them the opportunity to enhance and participate in campaigns and alternatives for each of the issues proposed, becoming participants of the project. The internet premiere will start with the first chapter on November, 18th, the same day it premieres in cinemas. Coinciding with its period in <a href="www.verkami.com">Verkami's crowdfounding platform</a>, InterferÃ¨ncies will be debuting weekly with a new chapter until the entire movie can be viewed online on December 20."</p></blockquote>
