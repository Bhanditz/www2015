<p>The <a href="http://publius.cc/">Publius Project</a> at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society offers a new essay on OER and public policy in the United States: <a href="http://publius.cc/brief_overview_us_public_policy_oer_californias_community_colleges_obama_ad">A Brief Overview of U.S. Public Policy on OER from California's Community Colleges to the Obama Administration </a>. Written by Carolina Rossini and Erhardt Graeff, it does a great job of pointing out the major recent movements toward OER in state and federal governments, and thoughtfully evaluates the issues that each initiative brings to the table. </p>
<blockquote><p>"This post draws significantly from an interview on August 10, 2009 with Hal Plotkin, a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Dept. of Education, who has closely followed and been involved with OER policies in California. The interview was part of research on the educational materials sector being conducted under the Industrial Cooperation Project at the Berkman Center at Harvard University. The research is part of a broader project being led by Prof. Yochai Benkler and coordinated by Carolina Rossini. In the research, we are seeking to understand the approaches to innovation in some industrial sectors, such as alternative energy, educational materials, and biotechnology. The intention is to map the degree to which open and commons-based practices are being used compared to proprietary approaches and what forces drive the adoption and development of these models."</p></blockquote>
