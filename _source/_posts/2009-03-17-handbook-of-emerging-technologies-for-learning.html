<p>In this age of information overload, traditional teaching methods and roles are fast becoming extinct. Students have access to most of the relevant information in their teachers' heads and more, but this doesn't mean students know how to organize and interpret this information in a meaningful way. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/03/11/handbook-of-emerging-technologies-for-learning/">George Siemens</a> and Peter Tittenberger have developed a handbook for educators who want to use technologies to aid (both teachers and learners) in the learning process. <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wikis/etl/index.php/Handbook_of_Emerging_Technologies_for_Learning">The Handbook of Emerging Technologies for Learning</a> explores "[how education is] to fulfill its societal role of clarifying confusion when tools of control over information creation and dissemination rest in the hands of learners..." The issue is "information abundance" and the handbook is designed to be a resource for educators who want to face these issues head-on.</p>
<p>The handbook is available as a <a href="http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wikis/etl/index.php/Handbook_of_Emerging_Technologies_for_Learning">wiki</a> and <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/learning_technologies/cetl/HETL.pdf">PDF</a>, and is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/ca/">CC BY-NC</a>.</p>
