<blockquote><p>In a move that could shake up the book industry, publishing giant <span class="times">Pearson</span> PLC is joining with two top business schools to create a business book authored and edited by a "wiki" -- an online community dedicated to writing</p>
<p>...</p>
<p class="times">The wiki book, produced by a community of business experts and managers, will be called "We Are Smarter Than Me." It will explore how businesses can use online communities, consumer-generated media such as blogs, and other Web content to help in their marketing, pricing, research and service.</p>
<p>Barry Libert, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who is CEO of Shared Insights Inc., a Woburn, Mass., company, persuaded London-based Pearson, the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School to help develop the new book, which will be published under Pearson's Wharton School Publishing imprint.</p></blockquote>
