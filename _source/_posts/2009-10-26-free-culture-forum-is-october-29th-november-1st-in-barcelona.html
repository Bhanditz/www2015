If you're anywhere near Barcelona this coming weekend, you should seriously consider attending the <a href="http://fcforum.net/">Free Culture Forum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the planet, people are recognizing the need for an international space to build and coordinate a global framework and common agenda for issues surrounding free culture and access to knowledge. The Free Culture Forum of Barcelona aims to create such a space. Bringing together under the same roof the key organizations and active voices in the free culture and knowledge space, the Forum will be a meeting point to sit and put together the answers to the pressing questions behind the present paradigm shift.</p></blockquote>
<p>Representatives from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/es/">Creative Commons Spain</a>, <a href="http://www.freeculture.org">Students for Free Culture</a> and <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia</a> will be in attendance (<a href="http://fcforum.net/participants">among many others</a>), so it'll be a great opportunity to meet plenty of people in our community. Registration is free and open to the public, but <a href="http://fcforum.net/participate">there are more details on how to get involved here</a>.</p>
