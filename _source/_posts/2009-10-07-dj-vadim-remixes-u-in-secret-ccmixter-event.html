<p><a href="http://djvadim.com">DJ Vadim</a> and Creative Commons are celebrating <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>'s <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5036">fifth anniversary</a> with <a href="http://ccmixter.org/mixup/oct-09">Secret Mixter October '09</a>. In this event, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6086">6th of its kind</a> on ccMixter, starting today, musicians and singers sign up to have their name put into a virtual hat. After the two week sign-up period, everyone is notified, in secret, with a remix assignment. They then have two weeks to do a remix of their<br />
assignment. On November 4th, everybody will upload their remix - including Vadim!</p>
<p>DJ Vadim has long been a strong proponent of including his fans in the musical experience. He has been <a href="http://ccmixter.org/bbe">sharing the full studio stems</a> and a cappellas to his albums on ccMixter.org for several years. In early 2009, in advance of his album "U Canâ€™t Lurn Imaginashun," he gave a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14586">featured commoner interview</a> where he said </p>
<blockquote><p>â€œâ€¦releasing music is communication. Nowadays, that means participation and that is what ccMixter offers. It is a combination of the two, letting fans and music people participate and communicate together, with you, with me and create new music and ideas.â€</p></blockquote>
<p> With his participation in the Secret Mixter, Vadim is making the ultimate statement about what it means to communicate with his fans.</p>
<p>Come and join the ongoing musical conversation of the Commons at the  <a href="http://ccmixter.org/mixup/oct-09">Secret Mixter October '09</a> - you never know who's going to remix you.</p>
