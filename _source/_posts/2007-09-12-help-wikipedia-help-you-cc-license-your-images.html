<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/070911-083723.php">An Untapped SEO Opportunity: Image Link Love From Wikipedia</a> suggests that web marketers should license their images under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> and contribute them to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org">Wikimedia Commons</a> for use on Wikipedia sites.</p>
<p>I like this advice for the obvious reason (encouraging CC licensing, especially under a liberal CC license), but the remarkable thing is that following this "Search Engine Optimization" advice contributes to the greater good.  This is largely a testament to the robustness of the Wikipedia community.  As I said regarding similar but broader advice earlier this year in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7435">Creative Commons for Newspapers, Scientists, Film students and Wikipedia SEOers(!?)</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apart from the CC recommendation, this last article really points to the benefits of the Wikipedia community. Normally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">â€™search engine optimizationâ€™</a> is associated with people basically attempting to scam the search enginesâ€™ anti-spam defenses, but most of the articleâ€™s tips on participating in Wikipedia are for the good â€” itâ€™s hard to get any value out of Wikipedia without adding value for others, i.e., itâ€™s hard to scam the Wikipedia community.</p></blockquote>
