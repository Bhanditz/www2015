<p><a href="http://www.openeducation.net/" title="http://www.openeducation.net/">OpenEducation.net</a> tracks the changing climate of education--more specifically, the movement towards the growing availability of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a> on the web.  In a recent post entitled, <a href="http://www.openeducation.net/2008/02/21/the-digital-commons-%e2%80%93-left-unregulated-are-we-destined-for-tragedy/" title="http://www.openeducation.net/2008/02/21/the-digital-commons-%e2%80%93-left-unregulated-are-we-destined-for-tragedy/">The Digital Commons -- Left Unregulated, Are We Destined for Tragedy?</a> , they explore the potential of the open digital commons, concluding that open access is the key to avoiding, not creating, tragedy.</p>
<p>They also recognize ccLearn as a part of this movement. ccLearn's Executive Director, Ahrash Bissell, recently spoke with OpenEducation.net about ccLearn's and, in general, Creative Commons' relationship to net neutrality. Check out the interview <a href="http://www.openeducation.net/2008/02/22/an-interview-with-ahrash-bissell-of-the-creative-commons/" title="http://www.openeducation.net/2008/02/22/an-interview-with-ahrash-bissell-of-the-creative-commons/">here</a>.</p>
