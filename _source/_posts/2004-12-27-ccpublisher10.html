<p>After six busy months, I'm very pleased to announce the release of ccPublisher 1.0.  ccPublisher 1.0 is a feature complete, stable tool which allows users (that's you) to easily license your work, and optionally upload it to the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> for free hosting and cataloging.</p>
<p>You can download ccPublisher for Windows (.msi) or Mac OS X (.dmg) from our <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher">servers</a> or from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cctools">SourceForge.net project</a>.  Linux distributions will be available soon.</p>
<p>We're not done developing ccPublisher, and have lots of improvements planned.  But I'm confident there are features and ideas we haven't thought of.  So <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CcPublisherRequests">write them down</a> or <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cctools-developer">join the discussion</a>.</p>
