In July, a group of design students from the University of London made a tool called Prayer Companion, which streams news headlines from RSS feeds on a portable cross-shaped device. The nuns were hesitant at first about integrating technology into their Medieval lifestyle, but once they realized it would let them pray for the most pressing global problems, they agreed. Now "Goldie"--named after Goldsmiths College, where it was created--is part of their daily prayer routine.</p>
<p>Stanford computational engineering professor &lt;a href="<a href="http://kamvar.org/">http://kamvar.org/</a>"&gt;Sep Kamvar&lt;/a&gt; tells me this story with great delight. He invented the API that the Goldstone students used to make Prayer Companion. This kind of seamless and unlikely blend of technology and humanity is at the core of what he hopes to get out of his research.</p>
<p>It's fun to toy with the idea that computers might take over humans one day. But, as Kamvar points out, "there are a lot of things that people are good at that computers are not good at"--like empathy, giving subjective advice, and prayer. One thing they are good at is crunching large amounts of data instantly. One of Kamvar's missions, then, is to survey human emotions portrayed on the Internet through massive amounts of publicly available data in hopes of gaining a slightly deeper understanding of people.</p>
<p>In 2006, Kamvar and colleague Jonathan Harris launched an art project called &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.wefeelfine.org/">http://www.wefeelfine.org/</a>"&gt;We Feel Fine&lt;/a&gt;, a web site that crawls the blogosphere every minute and gathers information on feelings people express paired with their public identity profiles. Using the web interface, people could find answers to questions like , how did young people in Ohio feel when Obama was elected? "They're quick and cheap association experiments," Kamvar explains. "But the database can find you answers."</p>
<p>We Feel Fine's API was released under a CC NC-SA license, and shortly thereafter the web community started to come up with other creative ways to use it. One person lit up the City Hall in Denmark with different-colored lights based on how people were feeling. Another built a robot that would mix drinks inspired by the different emotions conveyed on the Internet. Prayer Companion, which drew a group of elderly nuns into a social network, was also built on the We Feel Fine API. "You have to really like people to build technology that's useful to them," Kamvar says. "My interest in people made me realize that you can not only build technology <em>for </em>people, but you can build technology that crucially <em>involves</em> people. I think it's very natural if you're interested in tech and have some interest in people to get really excited about the interplay between the two."</p>
<p>We Feel Fine was such a success that, in 2008, the NY Museum of Modern Art commissioned Kamvar and Harris to embark on yet another project, which they call &lt;a href="<a href="http://iwantyoutowantme.org/">http://iwantyoutowantme.org/</a>"&gt;I Want You To Want Me&lt;/a&gt;. I Want You To Want Me takes data from online dating sites and presents it on an interactive 56" touchscreen showing singles profiles in colorful balloons. That API will soon be available under CC license, too.</p>
<p>Kamvar's projects are amazing, but they only scratch the surface of the potential buried in the web to open up a world of data. "The tools of mining data from the social web will influence the social sciences in the same way that the microarray influenced biology," he says.Â "The more work people put out there and the more of themselves they put out there, the richer our technological society."</p>
<p>Why Sep Kamvar supports CC: Creative Commons has such an early understanding of the importance of open access to information in order to make derivative work on top of that information, and that's really important for art, education, and information science. A more open web is really, really, really beneficial for all three of these areas, and Creative Commons has simple, logical, and influential toolkits to make the web more open for these purposes.</p>
