<p>In May, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5881">we reported</a> that indie filmmaker <a href="http://www.solomonrothman.com/">Solomon Rothman</a> had released the trailer to his movie <a href="http://www.solomonrothman.com/boywhoneverslept/"><i>Boy Who Never Slept</i></a> online under Creative Commons' <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">BY-NC-SA</a> license. The full feature is now online, along with the film's <a href="http://www.solomonrothman.com/boywhoneverslept/open-source-files.php">source files</a>, which are -- quite wonderfully -- offered to the public under CC's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Attribution</a> license.</p>
