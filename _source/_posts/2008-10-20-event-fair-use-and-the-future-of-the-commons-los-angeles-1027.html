<p>For those based in Los Angeles, USC's <a href="http://iml.usc.edu/">Institute for Multimedia Literacy</a> is hosting a day long event, <em><a href="http://iml.usc.edu/index.php/events/2008/10/27/fair-use-and-the-future-of-the-commons/">Fair Use and The Future of the Commons</a></em>, next Monday (<strong>10/27</strong>) that focuses on fair use, copyright reform, and the notion of the 'commons'. The entire lineup looks fascinating and CC's Creative Director, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#50">Eric Steuer</a>, will be speaking on a panel discussion titled "Agents of Change". From <a href="http://iml.usc.edu/index.php/events/2008/10/27/fair-use-and-the-future-of-the-commons/">IML</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With fear, uncertainty and misinformation dominating the discourse of copyright and intellectual property, Fair Use has become one of the most vexing issues in todayâ€™s academic landscape. This day-long event at USCâ€™s Annenberg Research Park addresses these issues head-on with a series of presentations and discussions with key players in the advancement and redefinition of fair use, coupled with a faculty showcase and hands-on workshops at the Institute for Multimedia Literacy. The goal of this event is to bring clarity to questions of fair use for scholars and educators working with copyrighted media for research, teaching and electronic publication. We believe this event will facilitate some much-needed discussion of the state of contemporary Fair Use and where we should be setting our sights for the future. The event is free and open to the public - further details and schedule to be announced soon!</p></blockquote>
<p>The event will take place at Kerckhoff Hall in the Annenberg Research Park (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=734+West+Adams+Los+Angeles+CA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr">Google Map</a>) between 9AM-6PM and is free and open to the public.</p>
