<p>The teaser for <em><a href="http://www.ironsky.net/">Iron Sky</a></em>, a new movie from the people behind internet-blockbuster <em><a href="http://www.starwreck.com/">Star Wreck</a></em>, was recently posted online and has already received massive exposure (accumulating <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=4KEueJnsu80">over 350,000 YouTube views</a> in a little over two weeks). The tagline itself - <em>"In 1945 the Nazis fled to the moon. In 2018 they are coming back."</em> - should be enough to pique anyone's interest (you can <a href="http://www.ironsky.net/site/?page_id=10">read more about the story here</a>) but of particular note to those in the CC-community is the filmmakers' decision to license the teaser and music therein under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/fi/">BY-NC-SA license</a>.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.ironsky.net/site/?page_id=11">these stunning stills</a> from pre-production on the film as well as explore the bevy of information on the <a href="http://www.ironsky.net/site/?page_id=11">Iron Sky website</a>. Consider it an anticipated release in the coming months!</p>
