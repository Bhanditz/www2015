<p>It is one thing for the relatively nascent Wikipedia to embrace free culture as a way to create and share new cultural works, but it is another thing for established media players constrained by traditional markets and economic forces to embrace free culture. </p>
<p>Despite this, it is becoming less difficult to convince incumbent mainstream press and media to fully embrace the inevitability and ubiquity of free culture and there are a few key strategies that are emerging. Perhaps the most obvious lies in the the numerous cases of journalists using Creative Commons licensed photography to illustrate their articles. Faced with the complexities and cost of securing private digital licenses from stock agencies like Getty or Corbis, journalists and bloggers have discovered that eliminating those transaction costs (fiscal and otherwise) through the use of CC licensed photos can substantially increase the quality of their posts.</p>
<p>Some recent exciting examples include two New Yorker posts, one on<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2008/10/halloween-is-a.html">literary Halloween costumes</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2008/11/the-first-night.html">another on Obama's victory</a>; <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2008/11/nice-guy-garris.html">the LA Times featuring a flickr user's photo of ex-Republican VP nominee Sarah Palin</a>; and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7965">the New York Times' Polling Place Photo Project which we've blogged about several times</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not already using CC licensed material in your posts and digital media, these examples should give you another reason to consider the choice.</p>
