<p>The Helsinki Institute for Information Technology Will Drive Public Discussion from the Silicon Valley Nonprofit's Website</p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, California, USA</strong> - Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a layer of reasonable copyright, announced today that it would begin development of Finnish versions of its copyright licenses as part of its ongoing International Commons (iCommons) project. The Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT), an authority on law and technology in Finland, will lead the effort.</p>
<p>Announced in March 2003, iCommons is Creative Commons' project to make its machine-readable copyright licenses useful worldwide.</p>
<p>"With iCommons, we are building a system for promoting creativity across borders," said Lawrence Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford. "If you imagine different countries as legal operating systems,' iCommons will port our licenses for use across the world."</p>
<p>As project lead, HIIT will coordinate a public effort to literally and legally translate Creative Commons' licenses for use in Finland. HIIT will field public comments on an archived email discussion at the Creative Commons website, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#finland">http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#finland</a>.</p>
<p>"HIIT is enthusiastic to host iCommons in Finland," said Martti MÃ¤ntylÃ¤, research director of HIIT and a professor at Helsinki University of Technology. "Creative Commons could do the same for the entertainment and publishing industries that free software and open source did for the software business."</p>
<p>Christiane Asschenfeldt, the iCommons Coordinator at Creative Commons, commented: "It is great to get the iCommons drafting process underway with a project lead of HIIT's experience and expertise. Finland will set an excellent precedent for many other iCommons countries, which in the near future will include Brazil, Japan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom."</p>
<p>"Finnish copyright law doesn't differ much from the U.S. system," said HIIT project lead Herkko Hietanen. "But by translating the licenses to Finnish, we'll make it even easier for Finnish artists and authors to adopt Creative Commons licenses and share their works with the world."</p>
