<p>The International Herald Tribune has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/524710.html">a nice story</a> on the explosive growth of iCommons, with a focus on the recent launch in Germany. The Register UK also has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/german_creative_commons/">a nice piece</a>. Hats off to Christiane Asschenfeldt, Roland Honekamp, and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">many iCommons project leads</a> for the recent boom. More to come.</p>
