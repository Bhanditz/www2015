<p>As research communities worldwide look for new ways to make the scientific process and its data and results more open and participatory, New Zealand is showing us how it is done.</p>
<p>In July 2010, <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal" title="The New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework">The New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework</a> (NZGOAL) approved by the Cabinet provided guidance for agencies to follow when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by others. NZGOAL seeks to standardise the licensing of government copyright works for re-use via Creative Commons New Zealand law licences and recommends the use of â€˜no-known rightsâ€™ statements for non-copyrighted material.</p>
<p>Then in August 2011, the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/declaration-open-and-transparent-government" title="Declaration on Open and Transparent Government">Declaration on Open and Transparent Government</a> was also approved by the Cabinet whereby the government committed to actively release high value public data "to enable the private and community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen the social and cultural fabric, and sustain the environment... to encourage business and community involvement in government decision-making."</p>
<p>And earlier this month in December 2012, a report of the Education and Science Committee presented to the House of Representatives of the 50th Parliament an <a href="http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/FD34151C-744B-4B49-86F2-6FE5850123AE/256992/DBSCH_SCR_5695_Inquiryinto21stcenturylearningenvir.pdf" title="Inquiry into 21st century learning environments and digital literacy">Inquiry into 21st century learning environments and digital literacy</a>. Among its recommendations were that the Government:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>review the intellectual property framework for (NZ) education system to resolve copyright issues that have been raised, including considering Creative Commons policy.</li>
<li>consider the advantages and disadvantages of whether all documentation produced by the Ministry of Education for teaching and learning purposes should be released under a Creative Commons licence.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with this spirit, a group of researchers committed to bringing an Open Research conference to Australia and New Zealand are organizing a <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/home" title="three day event February 6-8, 2013 in Auckland.">three day event February 6-8, 2013 in Auckland.</a></p>
<p>The purpose of this conference is to explore new, open models of research that speed up the effective transfer of research results and improve economic, environmental and social impacts. A growing community of researchers around the world are investigating new commercial and academic models to enhance the reach of their research. These new ways of doing research openly are akin to changes happening in the IT and business world, where open innovation has enabled people to achieve more together than they ever could alone.</p>
<p>Creative Commons plays a key role in promoting openness in science. Events such as this one in Auckland demonstrate the concern about open science that the community shares with Creative Commons. In the end, only good things can come out of openness, sharing and broad participation. Creative Commons is very pleased to see this event take place, and wishes it utmost success.</p>
