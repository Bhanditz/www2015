<p><a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/"><img src="img/screenshot_01.jpg" alt="" title="screenshot_01" width="322" height="286" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-20196" /></a>Last year, Al Jazeera <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12049">launched</a> their <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">Creative Commons Repository</a> with 12 videos shot in Gaza under CC's most open license, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution only</a>. Since then, Al Jazeera's <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">collection</a> has grown, and their most recent footage includes videos documenting everyday life and culture in Iraq. </p>
<p>Check out this video of an <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/node/79">Iraqi artist</a> sculpting a Minaret and painting a tree. The sculptures seem to be encased afterward in gold or some other substance---I'm not entirely sure since I'm not fluent in Arabic. The good news is that the video and all others in this repository are licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, so someone can help translate this into English or other languages, for use by rival broadcasters or in documentaries.</p>
<p>There are also more videos about the <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/node/80">communication network</a> in Iraq, and Samarra's <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/node/81">pharmaceutical factories</a> and <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/node/76">poultry farms</a>.</p>
<p>You can also start remixing these videos to tell a compelling story, whether it's a 30 sec or twenty minute film clip, maybe laid with some <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">CC licensed soundtracks</a>. Be creative. There's a lot of <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">CC licensed stuff</a> out there. All <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazeera CC repository</a> videos are available via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, which means you can edit, adapt, translate, remix or otherwise use them as long as you credit Al Jazeera. Interested persons can add the Al Jazeera repository to <a href="http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http://aljazeeraasset.blip.tv/rss">their Miro feeds</a>.</p>
