<p>One month in to the revamped <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">CC Case Studies</a> project, and you might be curious to hear how it's going. For starters, there have been some brilliant <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Category:Casestudy?">new submissions</a>, the most compelling of which will be included in upcoming publications and research. We're still collecting more user-submitted studies, so hop over to our wiki and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">add YOUR story</a>!</p>
<p>Here's a taste of what's available:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-15320 alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="remixhome" src="img/remixhome.png" alt="remixhome" width="300" height="196" /></p>
<p>UC Berkeley shares with us their open archaeology experiment,<strong> <a title="Case Studies/Remixing Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Remixing_%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Remixing Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k</a></strong>. This innovative project interprets archaeological excavations from a 9,000-year-old settlement mound of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in central Turkey, and it employs Creative Commons licensing to encourage academics and students alike to explore and remix their data sets and multimedia.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Case Studies/UrbanMinistry.org" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/UrbanMinistry.org">UrbanMinistry.org</a></strong> has written to us about a unique case study on how they use Creative Commons licenses to better deliver online faith-based materials and social services to under-resourced communities.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-15141 alignright" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="silviao" src="img/silviao-300x300.jpg" alt="silviao" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>A submission by<strong><a title="Case Studies/Linux Outlaws" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Linux_Outlaws"> Linux Outlaws</a></strong> demonstrates how their freely licensed content created "a vibrant and active community of listeners and fans." The show's producers write that the "surprising success of the show would never have been possible without the ability, and explicit encouragement, to share the content freely in every way possible."</p>
<p>There are of course a number of "classic" CC studies to browse, such as the well-detailed account of the Nine Inch Nails release, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Nine_Inch_Nails_The_Slip"><strong><em>The Slip</em></strong></a>, and the award-winning citizen media platform <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Global_Voices_Online"><strong>Global Voices Online</strong></a>. A few people also have begun writing non-English case studies, for example one about Berlin's CC-music-only bar, <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/De:Breipott">Breipott,</a></strong> or the Colombian singer <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Es:Silvia O in the remix culture"><strong>Silvia O</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The CC Case Studies are a growing and community-driven resource. The stories are as powerful as the information that supports them, so we welcome you to take a moment and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">share with us why YOU use CC and how</a>.  The more data you can provide about your work, the better.</p>
