<h2>More about Funda&#231;&#227;o Getulio Vargas</h2>
<p>Funda&#231;&#227;o Getulio Vargas (FGV), founded in 1944, is the leading Brazilian academic institution in the fields of Economics, Public and Business Administration.  Being a non-profit institution, its mission is to expand the frontiers of knowledge and to contribute to the country's social and economic development.</p>
<p>Since the 70's, FGV has been active in the field of legal education, especially in connection with Economics and Business. Recently, FGV created its own law school at Rio de Janeiro (FGV Direito Rio).  From its creation, the Law School has been playing an important role as an interlocutor in policy-making, as well as in the transformation of legal studies in Brazil.</p>
<p>One of its most prominent concentration areas is Law &#38; Technology, where the School cooperates closely with the government and with private entities, aiming to foster the development of the Brazilian information society.  In 2003, FGV's Law School organized together with the Berkman Center for Internet &#38; Society at Harvard Law School the I-Law Program, bringing it for the first time to Latin America.</p>
