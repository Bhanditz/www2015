<p>A few weeks ago a group of CC staffers traveled to the <a href="http://okfestival.org/">Open Knowledge Festival</a> in Helsinki, Finland to meet with our friends in the open knowledge and data community. There were many welcome outcomes from this - including our European regional meeting (expect a post on this soon) - not the least of which was our second <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-open/">School of Open</a> workshop.</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of it yet, the School of Open is a collaboration between Creative Commons and <a href="http://p2pu.org/">P2PU</a> (Peer 2 Peer University). Its aim is to provide easily digestible educational exercises, resources, and professional development courses that help individuals and institutions learn about and employ open tools, such as the CC licenses. You can find out more at this <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/School_of_Open">wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>During the second half of 2012, Creative Commons is holding School of Open workshops around the world, including Berlin, Palo Alto, Mexico City, London, and Jakarta. The idea behind these workshops is to bring together those interested in spreading the word about open knowledge, teach them about peer-learning and the role it can play in this, and (hopefully) start them down the track of creating their own peer-led course on open.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://peerlearningworkshop.eventbrite.com/">Helsinki workshop</a>, which ran on the Wednesday of the festival, was a joint project with the <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/">School of Data</a>, a similar initiative run by P2PU and the Open Knowledge Foundation to promote data literacy and data â€˜wranglingâ€™ skills. The workshop was a great success, with a full house of more than 25 attendees, including educators, programmers, digital technologists and enthusiasts. After introductions and explanations, about 12 chose to work on projects for the School of Open, while the rest broke off to take School of Data courses. </p>

<p>In just four hours, this School of Open team managed to complete the <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/groups/teach-someone-something-with-open-content/">"Teach someone something with open content"</a> challenge and get a good way through the <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/groups/make-a-course/content/bonus-task-playstorm/">"Make a P2PU course in half an hour"</a> mini-course. The result were outlines for several new P2PU courses, designed to teach people new skills entirely through CC-licensed and other open materials including <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/groups/making-music-and-sharing-it-openly/">"How to share and distribute a song"</a>. You can find all related notes and materials from the workshop <a href="http://etherpad.creativecommons.org/p/Okfest">here</a>. </p>
<p>Feedback from the participants in the workshop was great - everyone felt that by the end of the day they had a good understanding of the workings of the School of Open and the potential it had to provide learning resources for anyone and everyone. They also had some great feedback on ways to improve the school's web interface, materials and structure, based on their own experiences and expertise. And they were all keen to continue to work on their courses and the School of Open.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all those who participated in the workshop on achieving so much in such a short amount of time. We look forward to seeing you around the School of Open discussion lists and events. For anyone else who wants to get involved, the best way to start is to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/school-of-open">join the discussion list</a> and/or sign up for <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/school-of-open-announce">announcements</a>.
