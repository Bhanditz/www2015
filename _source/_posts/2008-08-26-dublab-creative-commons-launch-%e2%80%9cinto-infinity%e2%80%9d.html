<p><strong>Ready-to-Remix Art and Music Exhibit Online Now; Physical Installations to Follow</strong></p>
<p><strong>San Francisco, CA, USA and Los Angeles, CA, USA â€” August 26, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Today, dublab and Creative Commons announced the launch of Into Infinity, an art and music exhibit jointly produced by the two nonprofit organizations. The online version of the exhibit is online now at <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/">http://intoinfinity.org</a>; physical installations are being planned for Winter 2008 and throughout 2009.</p>
<p>Into Infinity comprises a collection of ready-to-remix 12-inch circular artworks and 8-second music loops created by a vast array of artists from around the world. Contributors include world-renowned graffiti artist Kofie, 2008 Whitney Biennial alumni Lucky Dragons, Anticon collective member Odd Nosdam, and electronic musicians Flying Lotus and DNTEL (AKA Jimmy Tamborello of The Postal Service). New submissions will be added to the exhibit regularly.</p>
<p>All of Into Infinityâ€™s works are available for download under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial copyright license. This license gives the public the legal right to share, remix, and reuse all of the pieces of Into Infinity for noncommercial purposes. For the full terms of this Creative Commons license, visit <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/</a><span style="LOL"></span>.</p>
<p>Into Infinityâ€™s producers invite people to download the exhibitâ€™s works and use them as source material for their own creations.</p>
<p>â€œInto Infinity is all about embracing the infinite possibilities of art and music,â€ says Mark McNeill, dublabâ€™s founder. â€œThese works are available to everyone in the world to reshape, remix, and redesign as many times over as possible. We canâ€™t wait to see all of the creative ways people use them.â€</p>
<p>â€œSampling, remixing, and repurposing other peopleâ€™s work has resulted in some of the greatest art of our times,â€ says Eric Steuer, Creative Commonsâ€™ creative director. â€œWith this project, we want to make the statement that this sort of creativity should not only be legal, but also explicitly encouraged.â€</p>
<p>Into Infinityâ€™s producers add that new works made from assets offered online will be eligible for submission to the exhibit.</p>
<p>â€œAs the show regenerates and expands, weâ€™ll incorporate the best remixes into the show for display online and in our real-world exhibitions,â€ says McNeill.</p>
