<p>When you go searching for Creative Commons&#8211;licensed content, you never know what you'll find. Sometimes you'll find the exact photo or piece of sound you were looking for, and sometimes you'll find something you never could have imagined.</p>
<p><a href="http://ccthing.tumblr.com/">We've created a new Tumblr blog</a> to celebrate those unusual, beautiful, and quirky CC finds from around the web. It's the <a href="http://ccthing.tumblr.com/">Creative Commons Thing of the Day</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://ccthing.tumblr.com/">Sign up to get the Thing of the Day delivered to your inbox every morning</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the last week and a half in Thing of the Day.</p>

<p>Ronen Kadushin designs unusual pieces of furniture like this unorthodox bookcase. He shares the designs under Creative Commons licenses and invites people to experiment with them, adapt them, and share their modified versions. <a href="http://www.ronen-kadushin.com/files/4613/4530/1263/Open_Design_Manifesto-Ronen_Kadushin_.pdf">Kadushin writes</a>, "An open design value is increased with wider modification possibilities and transformation potentials into other products. Designs that typically live only a few years in the marketplace can live on and develop into new shapes and uses."</p>

<p>Jonathan Mann writes a song every day. Many of them tackle complex emotions and ideas. But inevitably, a lot of them are just silly, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtT1inUGqyk">"Buy My Bed in Brooklyn</a>." In songs like "Buy My Bed," we see a songwriter whose talent lies in his childlike approach to day-to-day life.</p>
<p><a href="http://teamopen.cc/jonathan/">On why he licenses all his music under CC</a>, Jonathan told us, "Itâ€™s kind of a no-brainer... I donâ€™t even really understand why anyone would do anything different. It makes such simple sense."</p>

<p><a href="http://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014">Coming Out Simulator</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/ncasenmare">Nicky Case</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a></p>
<p>Nicky Case creates videogames that deal with issues many videogame designers wouldn't touch. Nicky's <a href="http://www.nothingtohide.cc/">Nothing to Hide</a> is a frank look at government and corporate surveillance, and an addictive puzzle game to boot.</p>
<p>Coming Out Simulator is a semiautobiographical game about Nicky coming out of the closet to their parents. The player is given choices of what to say, but the heartwrenching ending is inevitable.</p>

<p>Illustrator <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewtarcher">Andrew Archer</a> drew these <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/18006477/California-Magazine">terrifying images of a post-apocalyptic California</a> for a feature in California Magazine.</p>

<p>These gorgeous prints feature words that capture ideas and feelings we've all experienced, but that don't translate well into English. By introducing such perfect words to English speakers, they serve as a testament to the way that languages constantly grow, adapt, and borrow words from each other.</p>

<p>Here at CC, we're huge fans of the photography blog <a href="http://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>. The blog presents a single photo every day - the Unsplash curators have a great eye for delightful slices of life. The best part is that all of the photos are available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>, meaning that anyone can use them for any purpose, commercial or noncommercial, with or without attribution.</p>

<p>The OO-Ray's <em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/disquiet/tedladeras">Silhouettes</a></em> is a great example of how Creative Commons&#8211;licensed work can take on a life of its own. The OO-Ray (n&#233; Ted Laderas) composed and recorded the piece in 2011. Since then, <a href="http://15people.net/silhouettes-videos/">it's appeared in dozens of videos</a> thanks to its CC license. <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/09/23/sound-video-creativecommons/">As Laderas told SoundCloud</a>, "It's incredibly energizing to see that people like your music so much to include it in their video."</p>
