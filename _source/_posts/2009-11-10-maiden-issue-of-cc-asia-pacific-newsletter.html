<p>From the editors:</p>
<blockquote><p>[At the <a href="http://cc-asia-pacific.wikidot.com/">â€œCommons Crossroadsâ€</a> conference in Manila] it was proposed to have a bi-monthly electronic newsletter from which each of us can be informed of CC activities in one anotherâ€™s jurisdiction. It is also hoped that the newsletter serves as a venue to share experience and to enable collaboration.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read more about the <a href="http://cc-asia-pacific.wikidot.com/">Commons Crossroads conference</a>, the region's Action Plan Statement, and more cool stories from <a href="http://creativecommons.jp/">Japan</a>, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.or.kr/">South Korea</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.tw/blog/">Taiwan</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/ph/">the Philippines</a>, <a href="http://cchk.wetpaint.com/">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/">Australia</a>, and <a href="http://cn.creativecommons.org/">China Mainland</a>.</p>
<p>Although English isn't the first language of many Asia-Pacific jurisdictions, the contributors took an extra effort to prepare the newsletter for a global audience. A huge thank you to the writers and to CC Philippines and CC Taiwan for editing this fantastic volume.
