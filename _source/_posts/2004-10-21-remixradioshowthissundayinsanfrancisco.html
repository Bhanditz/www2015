<p>At 2pm this Sunday on the Bay Area's <a href="http://www.kalw.org/">KALW</a> (91.7), Benjamen Walker's "<a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio/">The Creative Remix</a>" will debut on the airwaves. The main point of the show: "If remixing is an art form why are the lawyers running the conversation?" Follow Ben, whose insight and sense of humor have drawn him <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=benjamen+walker&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">a cult radio following</a>, as he speaks with artists about traditional kinds of collage -- like DJ Dangermouse's Grey Album -- but also art you might not have considered "remixing" -- historical fiction, for example, or an ancient poetic form called the Cento. <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio/">Read more about the show</a>. And Bay Area people, mark your calendar: 2pm, this Sunday, <a href="http://www.kalw.org/">KALW</a> (91.7).</p>
