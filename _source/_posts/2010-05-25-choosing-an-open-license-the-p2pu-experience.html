<p>There are a lot of things to consider when it comes to choosing a CC license. The factors are different for everyone, whether you're an individual creator or an institution. Usually, the decision is made and the process by which it was made fades into memory or only remains via word of mouth or blog posts. The <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a> (P2PU) didn't want this to happen so they decided to document their process when the community held its first workshop in Berlin. <a href="http://p2pu.org/sites/p2pu.org/files/P2PU_Choosing_a_Licence_Final_June_2010.pdf">A Guide to CHOOSING AN OPEN LICENCE: The Peer 2 Peer University Experience</a> is the result of their efforts. From the <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2010/05/25/how-to-choose-the-right-licence/">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>P2PU has always been committed to openness in everything we do, from the way we run our activities, to how we licence the materials we produce. However, as many people who have worked in the Open Educational space will attest, choosing the right kind of licence, one that provides both the protections and the freedoms that a project like P2PU may require, can be a tricky process...</p>
<p>As we went through the process, we also realised that our experiences may be useful for other people who are undergoing a similar exercises. So we decided to document what we did, and why, and how it turned out. And today, we are proud to announce the publication of our Guide to Choosing an Open Licence (with a CC licence, of course!) In this document, youâ€™ll find details of every step we took to choose our licence, and a range of opinions from several open educators, lawyers and practitioners which we found invaluable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The P2PU experience is only one of many, and it is not necessarily the process or the license that everyone should choose. It is simply one example of a process that worked for a diverse community of people with various viewpoints. In the end, they chose <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> (with the allowance of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> for when content is entirely funded by a third party). The document is thorough, objective, helpful, and not very long--so make sure to <a href="http://p2pu.org/sites/p2pu.org/files/P2PU_Choosing_a_Licence_Final_June_2010.pdf">check it out</a>, especially if you're wondering how to go about choosing a CC license for your own project.
