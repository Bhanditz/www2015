<p>Open access journal â€” the <a href="http://www.bmj.com/">British Medical Journal</a> â€” recently published an <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1306">article</a> by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#34">John Wilbanks</a>, the Executive Director of one of CC's projects: <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science Commons</a>.  While much has been written about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a> and it represents a welcome and increasing trend in scientific and academic publishing, John's article provides a timely focus on how <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw">Semantic Web</a> can  practically ensure that access is open and we reap the full benefits of it, after the legal barriers have been removed.</p>
