<p>I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12662">blogged</a> about the past year's fellows in February, and now the deadline for 2010 is approaching next week. For those who don't know what TED is, I'll quote myself,</p>
<blockquote><p>"TED stands for â€œTechnology, Entertainment, Designâ€ and their talks are given annually at the TED conference in Long Beach, CA. 50 speakers give â€œtalksâ€ or 18 minute speeches about a variety of issues, including â€œscience, business, the arts and the global issues facing our world.â€ (Past speakers include Al Gore, our own Lawrence Lessig, and Jill Bolt Taylorâ€”a brain researcher who describes the stroke she suffers in exhilarating fashion, to name a few.)</p>
<p>Now, with the new TED fellows program, extraordinary people you may not have heard of yet (without the $6,000 to pay for standard admission to the conference) can give talks, too."</p></blockquote>
<p>To <a href="http://www.ted.com/fellows/apply">apply</a> for a fellowship, <a href="http://www.ted.com/fellows/apply">go to their website</a> and follow the instructions there. The deadline for all applicants is noon (EST), September 25. It's eighteen minutes of exposure to talk about anything you want; you could very well be that spokesperson for your cause.
