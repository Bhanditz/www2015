<p><a href="http://mollykleinman.com/">Molly Kleinman</a>, Copyright Specialist and Special Projects Librarian at the University of Michigan, just wrote up a nice <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/2008/08/15/cc-howto-1-how-to-attribute-a-creative-commons-licensed-work/">howto</a> for people who use Creative Commons licensed material in their work.  This will hopefully add to the repository of knowledge for best practices on material integration.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing issue in the community.  No matter how straight forward the instructions for providing attribution to a work are, mistakes will always be made.  Most times the mistakes are made not in malice but in a lack of guidance.  Luckily, Molly is taking up the task on her blog.</p>
<p>Her examples are easy to understand along with providing various methods of accomplishing the same goal.  She even has an "Ideal" example and a "Realistic" example.</p>
<p>From Molly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm taking the material I use in my workshops, mixing it up with CC's extensive documentation, and posting the results here. If anyone has ideas for topics they'd like me to cover, let me know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's hoping she continues on this project of producing easy to understand examples of how to use Creative Commons licenses effectively and correctly.</p>
