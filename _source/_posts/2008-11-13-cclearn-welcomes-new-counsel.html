<p>ccLearn welcomes its very first legal counsel, Lila Bailey, who will join our current team of two in February of next year. We have been seeking a counsel for months, and though the process has been long, it has been thorough and patient. We feel confident that we have found an excellent match in Lila, who fulfills the necessary qualifications and also brings a vitality and passion to her forthcoming role as an advocate and counsel for open education.</p>
<p>Lila will join our San Francisco office from Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, where she practices Internet-related litigation and counseling, with a particular focus on novel copyright and privacy issues.Â Lila has also worked with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) where she was an Intellectual Property Fellow in 2007. She earned her Juris DoctorÂ at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall) after graduating from Brown University with a BA in Philosophy.</p>
<p>With the busyness of the holidays ahead, we are delighted to head into the new year with Lila committed to our team.</p>
