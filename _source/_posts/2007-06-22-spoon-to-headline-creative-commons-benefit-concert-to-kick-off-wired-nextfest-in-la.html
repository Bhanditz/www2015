<p>We are very pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.spoontheband.com/" title="Spoon Homepage">Spoon</a>, the Austin, TX based rock-quartet, will headline a benefit concert for Creative Commons on September 10, 2007, at the Henry Fonda Theater in Los Angeles!</p>
<p>The concert will function not only as a fundraiser for CC, but also as a kick off for <a href="http://www.wirednextfest.com/" title="WIRED NextFest">WIRED NextFest</a>, "a unique worldâ€™s-fair-style event showcasing future technologies in design, entertainment, communication, healthcare, transportation, sustainable living and more".
