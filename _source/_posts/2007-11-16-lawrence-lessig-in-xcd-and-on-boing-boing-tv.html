<p>In case you hadn't heard, Lawrence Lessig is officially the most popular guy on the internet (for now)! Check out <a href="http://xkcd.com/342/">webcomic xkcd</a> for a great strip featuring Elaine, the "greatest hacker of our era", learning copyright from CC's CEO. For added enjoyment, check out a wonderfully lo-fi tribute by <s>Sweedish</s>Viennese "art-pranksters" Monochrom on <a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/2007/11/15/marks-curie-engine-m.html">BoingBoingTV</a>. That means he's cool.</p>
