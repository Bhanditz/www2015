<p>It is September again, and that means <a href="http://onewebday.org">OneWebDay</a> is just around the corner on September 22nd. <a href="http://www.onewebday.org/">One Web Day</a> is a once-a-year celebration of all that is good about the Web, and was launched in 2006 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_P._Crawford">Susan Crawford</a>. You might recognize Susan's name as President Obama's Special Assistant for Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy. While Susan is now at the White House, dozens of teams around the world are preparing ready for the festivities, so check <a href="http://onewebday.org/get-involved/">out OneWebdDay's map</a> or <a href="http://my.onewebday.org/main/authorization/signUp?">sign up to start your own team here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>One Web. For All.</strong></p>
<p>This yearâ€™s One Web Day theme is "One Web. For All." And while that might seem like an obvious theme for a day celebrating the Web, it's an unfortunate reality that the Web isn't yet available to everyone everywhere.  Though this fact is changing as more of the world gets online, we've still got a ways to go. Making sure the web is for everyone is also a goal shared by Creative Commons. We've designed our tools and licenses to work internationally, regardless of jurisdiction or language. But it also means we've translated our licenses into the languages of dozens of different jurisdictions. For more information on our international efforts, check out <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/">our international page</a>.</p>
<p>Making sure the web is for everyone is also about making sure everyone can participate. And that means open standards, low transaction costs, and transparent policies. Efforts like the push for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">network neutrality</a> amongst ISPs are crucial components to maintaining that the web remains open for all.</p>
<p>So on September 22nd, celebrate OneWebDay by taking some time to think about how important it is that we can all participate in the web and how that fact has fundamentally changed our society. </p>
