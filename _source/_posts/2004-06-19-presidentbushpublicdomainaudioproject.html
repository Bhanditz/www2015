Though the graphics on this project probably reveal the author's personal positions on the President, it is pretty cool that someone went to the trouble of creating <a href="http://www.thebots.net/GWBushSampleArchive.htm">an audio archive of every speech President George W Bush has made publicly</a>. They're available for download as mp3, or you can get all 10 Gb of audio on three DVDs from the site.</p>
<p>
It'd be cool if <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">the Library of Congress site</a> had this level of detail on all presidents, but this will do for now. They're even throwing <a href="http://www.thebots.net/BushRemixContest.htm">a little music remix contest</a> based on the speeches.</p>
