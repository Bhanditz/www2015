<p><a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>, the terrific sharing-friendly record label that we've talked about many times before, has announced a transition from a per-album purchase model to a "DRM-free, all-you-can-eat, pay-what-you-want" model. Label founder John Buckman spelled out the details in a blog <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2008/11/membership-with.html">post</a> today.</p>
<blockquote><p>Memberships to Magnatune are now:</p>
<p>1) <strong>no commitment</strong>: one month at a time, whereas previously the minimum was 3 months</p>
<p>2) <strong>pay what you want</strong>: you fill in the amount you want to pay (no drop down box), though there is a $5/month stream membership minimum, and $10/month download membership minimum.</p>
<p>3) <strong>paypal recurring payments</strong>: use paypal recurring payments instead of a credit card, so you are completely in command of your membership, and can cancel it from Paypal if you like.</p>
<p>4) <strong>non-recurring and recurring both available</strong>: you choose whether you want your membership to auto-renew, or if you want to renew it by hand yourself</p>
<p>5) <strong>DRM free, Creative Commons licensed, and perfect audio quality</strong>: so you are free to enjoy our music as you wish</p>
<p>6) <strong>shareable music with your friends</strong>: you can share music you've obtained from your membership with your friends, though we ask you to be mindful of our business model and <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/faq_download#canshare">recommend</a> you share no more than one album per friend per month</p>
<p>7) <strong>Everything</strong>: complete access to all our music. Downloads, 4h podcasts, streaming, iTunes &amp; Amarok &amp; Rhythmbox &amp; Songbird support, and more.</p>
<p>8) <strong>Musicians get paid</strong>: with everything you do, 50% of your membership fee goes to the musicians you listen to. Magnatune remains fair to the musician.</p></blockquote>
