<p>ccMixter maestro Victor Stone summarizes the good news:</p>
<p><a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/index.php">The freesound project</a> is a web site for collecting tiny audio snippets and samples and sharing them under a Creative Commons license for use in larger audio works such as soundtracks, original material and oh yea, remixes. In just over the first year of operation they accumulated almost 20,000 samples of every shape, size and variety.</p>
<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> is a site sponsored by Creative Commons that specializes in hosting remixes all under CC license and has the special ability to track the sources of the remixes. In almost two years of operation, ccMixter has had nearly 5,000 uploads from producers using samples from their own libraries, ccMixter itself and of course the freesound project.</p>
<p>It was only a matter time the two sites work together. Remixers from ccMixter that use samples from the freesound project can now track the sources of the remix back to freesound (and soon viceversa). You can see this in action with teru's remix of "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/teru/6395">Ophelia's Song</a>" which includes electric guitar parts and an a cappella from ccMixter as well as a sample of a train passing and a <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/samplesViewSingle.php?id=8384">nylon guitar pluck</a> all of which are linked to from teru's remix page.</p>
<p>On a technical note: The underlying technology is based on an open programmer's interface first published by Creative Commons via ccMixter called <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/viewfile/pool_api_doc.xml">Sample Pools</a>. CC is continuing to recruit other sites with CC licensed music to expand the pool. Every installation of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost">ccHost</a> (the open source code project that ccMixter runs on) is already enabled for Sample Pools.</p>
