<p>Only one month after the official release of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/Casestudies">Case Studies</a> project and already the response has been great!  As you saw from my <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8423">one week update</a> the media response has also been very positive.</p>
<p>We aren't resting on our laurels yet!  There is more to be done but here is what is new:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are now up to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/index.php?title=Special:Ask&offset=0&limit=500&q=[[Category%3ACasestudy]]&p=format%3Dbroadtable&po=%3FAuthor%0A%3FFormat%0A%3FCountry%0A&order=ASC">over 110 case studies</a> which is up from 90 when we publicly launched the project.  Thanks to everyone who has helped and added case studies!</li>
<li>With all of the activity going on in the Case Studies project it might seem hard to know what is going on.  Not any more!  We enabled a feature on the main page so you can see the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:Ask/-5B-5BCategory:Casestudy-5D-5D/%3FAuthor/%3FCountry/sort%3DRevision_time/order%3DDESC">last edited case studies</a>.</li>
<li>The future of the Case Studies project is looking great also.  To see what is planned and what is already done check out the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Casestudies_roadmap">Case Studies Roadmap</a>.</li>
<li>Also, be sure to check out the new featured Studies on the main <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Casestudies">Case Studies</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, a big thank you to everyone who has participated in the project thus far.  There is always room for more contributors though!</p>
