<p>As Creative Commons' CEO <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003664.shtml">Lawrence Lessig noted</a>, we are pleased to announce that we have exceeded our $300,000 fundraising goal for 2006! The support we have received is vital to extending the work that we've already begun and initiating new projects that will help grow this vital movement.<br />
We want to take this opportunity to reiterate how much we appreciate all of our communities past support and how excited we are about the future.</p>
<p>We have experienced a phenomenal amount of public support during this campaign. From the number of community members' creative ways of donating to the<a title="Revver initiative" href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6135"> Revver initative</a>, <a title="Flickr Contest" href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest/">Flickr Contest</a> and our <a title="4th Birthday Party" href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7156">4th Birthday Party</a>, it has been an amazing 4 years. <strong>Thank you</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to the success of our campaign, we also had an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7159">enormously successful CC Birthday Party celebration</a>, both Internationally and virtually. For this, I would like to give some shout outs to:</p>
