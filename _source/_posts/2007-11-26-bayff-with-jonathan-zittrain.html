<p>Our friends over at EFF are hosting an event this week featuring noted cyberlaw theorist <a href="http://jz.org/">Jonathan Zittrain</a>, who will be delivering a presentation titled "The Future of the Internet -- And How to Stop It." Zittrain "will cover the pitfalls and solutions he sees looking forward, as freedom in the Internet ecosystem becomes increasingly threatened by the spread of closed, "appliancized tools" and rash approaches to security challenges". </p>
<p>It all happens this Wednesday, November 28 at 7:30 p.m at CNET Networks in San Francisco (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=235+2nd+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94105,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">235 2nd Street, SF CA, 94105</a>). It is free and open to the public and if you are in the area, make sure you check it out - more info available <a href="http://www.eff.org/calendar/2007/11/20/bayff-jonathan-zittrain">here</a>.</p>
