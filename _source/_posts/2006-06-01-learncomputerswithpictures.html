<p><a href="http://inpics.net">In Pictures</a> has published 22 computer books under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.5</a> license. These books cover computer basics with several operating systems, productivity applications and basic web design and programming. These books make maximum use of images.  A quote published at <a href="http://desktoplinux.com/news/NS6203677543.html">DesktopLinux</a> and elsewhere explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most computer books contain 50,000 to 100,000 words, but these contain only 5,000 or so. They're great for bringing newbies up to speed.</p></blockquote>
