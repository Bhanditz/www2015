<p>Mangrove forests have been described by the World Wildlife Fund as one of the <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/coasts/mangroves/mangrove_threats/">worldâ€™s most threatened tropical ecosystems</a>. In an effort to protect and raise awareness around this problem, MapWorks Learning launched the first of what they plan to make an <a href="http://www.mapworkslearning.org/announcements/students-in-costa-rica-help-protect-the-mangroves-during-earth-day-mapathon">annual Mapathon</a> for ecological preservation and learning. The inaugural event engaged schools, universities, and environmental groups around the world to document the health and well being of mangrove populations using the Mapping the Mangroves tool.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mappingthemangroves.org">Mapping the Mangroves (MTM)</a> toolkit is a project originally funded by Qatar Foundation International, and is now a keystone project of MapWorks Learning. MTM uses a mapping application built on the open source <a href="https://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi software platform</a>, relying on crowdsourcing to collect geographic and descriptive data about mangrove forests. The projectâ€™s reporting system allows anyone to submit a report about mangrove forests, describing the areaâ€™s biodiversity and pairing it with geographic coordinates and other sensor data. The data are then displayed on an interactive map on the projectâ€™s homepage, with all reports searchable and explorable by geographic region and other habitat or report traits. The data are freely available for download and licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>, too.</p>
<p>The MTM project is supporting the development of <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/authoring/2832-mapping-mangroves/view">OER curriculum</a> introducing learners to mangrove forest ecosystems, basic species identification, and explaining how they can take part in the monitoring and protection of forests around the world. The toolkit's learning material is available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license on <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/authoring/2832-mapping-mangroves/view">OER Commons</a>.</p>
