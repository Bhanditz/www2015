<p>After taking a break for a bit (things have been busy at CC) I'm happy to announce our June Salon, which we'll be partnering with the <a href="http://www.openvideoconference.org">Open Video Conference</a> on. Think of it as a Salon and the official OVC pre-party. </p>
<p>So come out to have some beers with the CC community watch some cool presentations, and meet some new faces in the free culture space. </p>
<p>June's Salon will feature an in depth chat with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Gaylor">Brett Gaylor</a>, writer and director of <a href="http://www.ripremix.com/">RiP! A Remix Manifesto</a>, a presentation by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_M%C3%B6ller">Erik Moeller</a>, Deputy Director of the <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation</a> WMF on <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update">Wikipedia's switch to Creative Commons</a> licenses, and some more guests to be announced. </p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
