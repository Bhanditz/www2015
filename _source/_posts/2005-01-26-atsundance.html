<p>I'll be on a panel on Digital Rights Management tomorrow at high noon at the <a href="http://festival.sundance.org/2005/filmguide/">Sundance Film Festival</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a key issue for any company that controls content or has a library it wants to exploit. Balancing issues of copyright/privacy versus profit is no small challenge. In the new digital age, is it possible to leverage content and maximize profit only when a top-notch DRM system is in place? The music industry learned its lesson the hard way with Napster; the film industry doesn't want to make the same mistake, but still finds itself fighting multimillion-dollar antipiracy lawsuits year after year. How will the newest state-of-the-art DRM software change how we deliver movies? Come hear from the experts, and find out what's on the horizon for the moviegoing (and book-reading) public. Moderated by Walter S. Mossberg, personal technology columnist for the Wall Street Journal.</p></blockquote>
