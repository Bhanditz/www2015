<p>Save the date! Announcing the next CC Salon SF on Wednesday, November 19th, from 7-9 pm. The theme for the salon will be "CC and Citizen Journalism," and we are very excited about the presenters we've got lined up:</p>
<p></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.wikinews.org/">Wikinews</a>: Volunteer Coordinator Cary Bass and Bay Area "Wikinewsie"  volunteer Jon Davis will talk about their experience at Wikinews, a global citizen journalism effort and project of the <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation</a>. </p>
<p>
From <a href="http://spot.us/">Spot.us</a>: David Cohn, who has been involved with myriad citizen journalism projects, the likes of which include <a href="http://newassignment.net/">NewAssignment.net</a> and his current endeavor, Spot.us - a project of the nonprofit <a href="http://www.centerformediachange.com/">Center for Media Change</a> - that allows an individual or group to take control of news by sharing the cost (crowdfunding) to commission freelance journalists.<br /></p>
<p>We hope you'll join us for what is sure to be a great evening of exploring the ways in which CC helps facilitate citizen news and media outlets - vital resources for sustaining a healthy culture of sharing!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Salon will be at <a href="http://www.shinesf.com/">Shine Bar</a> (21+): <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1337+Mission+St.,+San+Francisco,+CA+94103&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=image">Map and directions</a>. </p>
