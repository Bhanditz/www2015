Yesterday, I spoke at the <a href="http://www.aurorapictureshow.org/calendar/medarch.html">Media Archeology Film Festival</a> in Houston, Texas. The festival was put on by the <a href="http://www.aurorapictureshow.org/">Aurora Picture Show Microcinema</a> and showcased the collections of several 16mm film collectors, including <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/prelinger.php">Rick Prelinger</a> who makes many of his public domain films available online.</p>
