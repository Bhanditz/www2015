<p>Someone has to pick up the slack on reporting on all of CC Australia's great work. I guess that will be me. Check out what <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-community/2007-May/001806.html">Jessica Coates said </a>on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss">cc-community mailing list</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just wanted to drop you a quick line to point out a great collaborative film project CCau took part in over the weekend â€“ the Open Channel Video Slam (<a href="http://www.openchannel.org.au/artslaw/index.html">http://www.openchannel.org.au/artslaw/index.html</a>). Apologies for cross posts.</p>
<p>Basically the idea was to produce one 10 minute film, made entirely out of CC and original content, by locking 22 filmmakers in a bar for 33 hours a whole lot of equipment, wireless internet access, and coffee, alcohol and pizza. The event was organised by Andrew Garton of the <a href="http://www.openchannel.org.au">Open Channel Screen Resource Centre</a> (<a href="http://www.openchannel.org.au">http://www.openchannel.org.au</a>) a government funded film production and training centre, and was hosted by <a href="http://www.horsebazaar.com.au/">Horse Bazaar</a> (<a href="http://www.horsebazaar.com.au/">http://www.horsebazaar.com.au/</a>) a great digital-arts bar in the heart of Melbourne that hosts the Digital Fringe Festival each year. Elliott Bledsoe and I from CCau were both there to help with training and addressing tricky issues (eg licence compatibility, searching etc). </p>
<p>What we ended up with was a 10 minute film that incorporates 110 CC-licensed works â€“ photos, video, sound, music. This final product was screened in Horse Bazaar and on the big screen in Melbourneâ€™s cultural hub, Federation Square, at 7pm Monday 14 May. Itâ€™s also available for download under a BY-NC-SA licence at <a href="http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/">http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/</a>.  </p>
<p>It was a truly amazing experience, and a great learning curve for both us and the participants. Elliott and Andrew both documented the experience on their blogs (<a href="http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/">http://openchannel.org.au/blogs/videoslam/</a> and <a href="http://elliottsawitfirst.blogspot.com/">http://elliottsawitfirst.blogspot.com/</a>).  Weâ€™re also hoping to write up some of the lessons learned in an article, and maybe even an academic paper.</p>

<p>The question I have, is can this model spread? Who might be interested in doing this type of event? Hop onto our <a href="http://ceativecommons.org/discuss">discussion list</a> (cc-community) and/or blog about how you might do this type of event and link here for permalink trackback fun.</p>
