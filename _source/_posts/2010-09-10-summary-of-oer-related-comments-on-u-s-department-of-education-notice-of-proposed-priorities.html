<p>We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22912">previously wrote about</a> theÂ U.S. Department of Education's (Department)Â <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/08/05/2010-19296/secretarys-priorities-for-discretionary-grant-programs">Notice of Proposed Priorities</a> (NPP) for discretionary grant programs. The Department offered 13 proposed priorities, specifically mentioning Open Educational Resources (OER). Essentially, if the priorities are adopted, grant seekers could receive priority if they include OER as a component of an application for funding from the Department.Â OER is included in <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/08/05/2010-19296/secretarys-priorities-for-discretionary-grant-programs#h-28">Proposed Priority 13â€“Improving Productivity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Projects that are designed to significantly increase efficiency in the use of time, staff, money, or other resources. Such projects may include innovative and sustainable uses of technology, modification of school schedules, use of open educational resources (as defined in this notice), or other strategies that improve results and increase productivity.</p></blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, the NPP includes a Department <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/08/05/2010-19296/secretarys-priorities-for-discretionary-grant-programs#p-106">definition of open educational resources</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Open educational resources (OER) means teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use or repurposing by others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comments were accepted through September 7. There are 228 public submissions listed in the <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#docketDetail?R=ED-2010-OS-0011">docket folder</a> at Regulations.gov (note that some of these items are essentially duplicates, as contributors who submitted comments via a document attachment were given two unique IDs if they also included an introductory note in the text field on the submission portal).Â There are a few submissions that commented on the OER provision of the NPP. The following is a brief breakdown of these comments, based on relevant keyword searches of the docket.</p>
<p><em><strong>Creative Commons</strong></em><br />
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480b477e9"> ED-2010-OS-0011-0124.1</a></p>
<p>Creative Commons appreciates the inclusion of OER, and highlights the importance of public, standardized legal and technical tools for OER to be successful:</p>
<blockquote><p>The OER movement is poised to greatly further global access to and participation in education, but only if a critical mass of educational institutions and communities interoperate legally and technically via Creative Commons. Why is interoperability important? Because in its absence, content such as OER cannot be aggregated or mixed and then shared further in a legal or efficient manner without securing special permission from the original creators. Interoperability requires standardized, public licenses that grant rights in advance. Creative Commons licenses are the global standard for open content licensing, grant rights in advance, and are easy to understand and use. Institutions, teachers, and policymakers in all arenas should be required to implement and recommend use of CCâ€™s tools for educational resources.</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480b47ad0"> ED-2010-OS-0011-0120.1</a></p>
<p>The signing organizations appreciate the inclusion of OER, and suggest strengthening the definition of OER described in the NPP by: (1) replacing the conjunction "or" with the conjunction "and" to ensure that derivative use is clearly allowable; and (2) replacing the phrase "permits their free use or repurposing by others," with the phrase, "permits sharing, accessing, repurposing (including for commercial purposes) and collaborating with others." Under this approach, the revised definition would read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Open educational resources (OER) means teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain and have been released under an intellectual property license that permits sharing, accessing, repurposing (including for commercial purposes) and collaborating with others.</p></blockquote>
<p>The signing organizations also encourage the Department to make the innovative development, use, expansion and dissemination of OER an element of several other priorities, including Priority 2 (Implementing Internationally Benchmarked College and Career-Ready Elementary and Secondary Standards), Priority 4 (Turning Around Persistently Lowest Achieving Schools), Priority 5 (Increasing Postsecondary Success), and Priority 7 (Promoting Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education).</p>
<p><strong><em>State Educational Technology Directors Association</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480b47906"> ED-2010-OS-0011-0135.1</a></p>
<p>The State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) appreciates the inclusion of OER, and echoes the suggestion made in the joint comment above for the strengthening of the definition. In addition, SETDA endorses the inclusion of OER in Priority 2 (College/Career Ready Standards), and suggests OER be included in a new proposed priority entitled, "Technology, Innovation, and School Reform":</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe that investments in technology for learning represent a new baseline infrastructure for education, including investments in the human resources necessary to make best use of the new tools and services enabled by this infrastructure. Under this priority, projects designed to support innovative approaches to school reform could focus on one or more of the following priority areas ... (a) Transitioning from print to digital instructional materials, including especially those employing open educational resources ...</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Council of Chief State School Officers</em></strong><br />
<a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?R=0900006480b47b37"> ED-2010-OS-0011-0117.1</a></p>
<p>The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) appreciates the inclusion of OER, and highlights the importance of OER as a way to providing quality resources to students:</p>
<blockquote><p>The nationâ€™s chief state school officers are committed to ensuring that all students have access to high-quality instructional materials and other resources and OER represents an important tool for reaching this goal. Many states are already leading in this important area and welcome the opportunity to seek federal support for furthering their work, particularly as it contributes to supporting cost-effective implementation of the CCR standards. We urge you to preserve this priority in the final rule.</p></blockquote>

<p>1105 Media strongly supports SETDAâ€™s recommendations for strengthening the NPP, especially the addition of its proposed new priority, â€œTechnology, Innovation and School Reformâ€, which suggests that projects designed to support innovative approaches to school reform could focus on one or more of the following priority areas ... (a) Transitioning from print to digital instructional materials, including especially those employing open educational resources ...</p>
