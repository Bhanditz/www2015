The Center for Hellenic Studies of Harvard University has started <a href="http://www.xmlmania.com/news_article_1121-Delivering-Classics-Resources-with-TEI-XML-Open-Source-and-Creative-Commons-Licenses.php">applying Creative Commons licenses to its journals</a>. Classics@ is available online <a href="http://www.chs.harvard.edu/classicsat/index.html">at their site</a>. It's great to see further uptake in the educational world, as the ideals of academic publishing are pretty close to the goals of Creative Commons.</p>
