<p><a href="http://mediarights.org">MediaRights</a>, who run the <a href="http://mediathatmattersfest.org/mtm04/index.php">Media that Matters Film Festival</a>, has come across a <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/mtm04/archives/seeking_soundtrack_for_youthproduced_animation_on_global_warming.php">licensing problem</a> from one of its festival entries.  The youth-produced flash animation <i> Neglected Sky </i> sponsored by <a href="http://globalsolutions.org">Global Solutions</a> uses the song <a href="http://www.subpop.com/bands/postalservice/downloads.php">Such Great Heights</a> by <i>The Postal Service</i> in their animation, however, they only have a license to stream the song.  MediaRights had planned to put the entire 5th festival on a DVD and distributes it under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">Creative Commons license</a>. They had some confirmation that they'd be able to license the music, but at the last minute, things fell through.</p>
<p>
MediaRights now has five days to find replacement music for this piece and is looking to the commons for alternatives.  Help MediaRights out: <a href="http://www.globalsolutions.org/Flash_Contest/John_Cooney.html">watch the flash and listen to the music</a>. If you know of any CC licensed music that sounds similar,  <a href="mailto:shira@mediarights.org">drop MediaRights a line</a>. They prefer an Attribution license or something that's in the public domain.</p>
