<p>From the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2007/06/05/science-commons-in-the-news/">blog</a> ...</p>
<p><a href="http://iwr.co.uk">Information World Review</a> and <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/06-02-07.htm#balancing">SPARC's Open Access Newsletter</a> both feature pieces this month highlighting a new set of online tools recently released by <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc">SPARC</a>. The toolkit aims to help authors retain critical rights over their scholarly works.</p>
<p>From IWR's article, <a href="http://www.iwr.co.uk/information-world-review/news/2191386/commons-copyright-targets">"Commons copyright targets scientists"</a>, which was posted today:</p>
<blockquote><p>"[...]'This is about authorsâ€™ rights,' said <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/wilbanks/">John Wilbanks</a>, vice-president [for] Science Commons. 'Right now, authors trade the most important rights â€“ like the right to make copies of their own scholarly works â€“ to traditional publishers. That trade has led to an imbalanced world of restricted access to knowledge, skyrocketing journal prices, and an inability to apply new technologies to the scholarly canon of knowledge.'"</p></blockquote>
