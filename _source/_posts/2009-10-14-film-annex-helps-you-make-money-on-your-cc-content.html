Recently, <a href="http://www.filmannex.com/newsletter/show/163">the site launched CC license support</a> (complete with <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccrel">ccREL</a> expression via <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RDFa">RDFa</a>). This is fantastic news in and of itself, as it means there's now more choice for creators looking for platforms that support CC licensing options. But Film Annex isn't just another video hosting site. <a href=" http://www.filmannex.com/posts/blog_show_post/film-annex-monetizes-its-web-tv-network-and-finances-the-projects-of-its-content-providers/4105">They're helping filmmakers finance their productions through a unique blend of advertising and revenue sharing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Film Annex Web TVs come with interactive players that are syndication-friendly. Web TV owners can maximize their income by syndicating their Web TV players with their content and ads (pre-rolls) on other websites. While these content providers receive 50% of the advertising revenues generated on their Web TVs, they earn another 33% upon syndication. Publishers also benefit from this revenue share as they receive 33% of the revenues upon syndication. Publishers are also given the option to become financiers or executive producers on a project if they choose to donate a percentage of their share to the content provider.</p>
<p>Since August 2009, twenty content providers benefited from the Film Annex Network and its ad revenue share. The amount generated on each Web TV per month has approximately been 350-1000 dollars. Film Annexâ€™s short-term goal is to raise this number to 5000. In addition to promoting each Web TV individually, Film Annex mentions the new projects of the content providers on their respective Web TVs in order to raise awareness about them and receive audience support. </p></blockquote>
