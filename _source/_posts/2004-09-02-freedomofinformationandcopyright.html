<p>Ever had trouble convincing someone that copyright matters beyond just copyright? That it bumps into questions of censorship, freedom of information, even plain-old civics more every day? If so, here's a nice anecdote to pull out next time.</p>
<p>From the AP:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Defense Department spent $70,500 to produce a Humphrey Bogart-themed video called "The People's Right to Know" to teach employees to respond to citizen requests for information. But when it came to showing the tape to the public, the Pentagon censored some of the footage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why? Copyright concerns. <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=542&ncid=757&e=10&u=/ap/20040901/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/pentagon_bogart_video">Read more</a>.</p>
<p><em>Thanks, Chris.</em></p>
