<p>This is part three of a five week series on the Affiliate Team project grants. So far, you've heard from our affiliates in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42167">Africa</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42208">Arab World</a>. Today, we're showcasing projects in our Asia-Pacific region, including open data workshops from Japan, a media studies textbook from New Zealand, and software tools and guidelines for public domain materials from Taiwan.</p>

<em>by Puneet Kishor (project lead: Tomoaki Watanabe)</em></p>
<p>Last year in June, the <a href="http://creativecommons.jp/â€>CC Japan Affiliate team (CCJP) hosted by <a href="http://commonsphere.jp">CommonSphere</a>, won a grant to hold three workshops and a public symposium on the use of CC tools (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">licenses</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>) in the context of open data. The aim of the workshops was to respond to informal inputs from government and other stakeholders on their implementation of CC tools in the context of open data, a new frontier of openness in the last few years in Japan. The team was planning to invite involvement from Japanese national and municipal government agencies and <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/category/okfnlocal/okf-japan/">Open Knowledge Foundation Japan</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ipa.go.jp/about/research/20131121.html">first event was a workshop</a> at Information Processing Agency, IPA, an independent administrative agency discussing open data licensing. The panel involved a member of Open Knowledge Foundation Japan as well. The whole session was video-recorded by the IPA staff, and it is now available online, along with presentation materials. The attendance was mostly government officials and the agency staff, around 50 people, and an attendant survey indicated a reasonable success.</p>
<p>The second meeting was held among key figures related to open data and other relevant initiatives, as invitation-only discussions on licensing and other legal issues. CCJP provided logistics support and expertise. It was decided by the attendants that the discussion will remain informal and unpublished. </p>
<p>The third was a symposium to discuss implementation issues of open data, including licensing issues organized by the third party, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI5SGgXjMRE">Innovation Nippon</a>, a joint project between Google Japan and GLOCOM. Both CCJP and OKF Japan helped with pre-event publicity and provided expertise. It featured and was attended by local government officials and municipal law makers, along with business people and academics. The event was videocast and the archive is available already, along with the slides.</p>
<p>The team also responded to an important emerging development â€“ Japanese national government is revising terms of use for government web sites. Creative Commons Japan's interest has been to present benefits of interoperability with Creative Commons licenses, and ways to achieve that. </p>
<p>The discussion is still ongoing, and some are concerned about potential "undesirable" use of government information, which may lead to a non-interoperable terms of use. The Japanese government may lean towards more liberal and interoperable approach if a few of the following happen:</p>
<ol>
<li> Political will, however, key politicians are not necessarily expected to support liberal licensing allowing use that goes against public order.</li>
<li>Evidence, anecdotal or scientific, showing that more liberal licensing results in better outcomes. However, such evidence is not abundant, and some government agencies have very specific uses in mind that may make them hesitate.</li>
<li>Evidence showing other governments of developed countries are doing things differently from what Japan is doing or planning to do. UK, FR, US, AU, NZ all are CC-BY compatible or use a CC-BY license. Their licensing all seem to be open in the Open Definition sense. Japan may result a bit differently.</li>
<li>Prospective users actively asking for a change.</li>
</ol>
<p>The challenges faced by the team so far have been 1) the above-mentioned development away from CC tools and 2) the lack of availability of licensing and editing talent on a more stable basis. </p>
<p>The team is in talks with a local government to hold at least one more workshop to discuss licensing issues as they relate to local governments. The symposium was originally planned to be at the end, but given the emerging development above, it may be timed differently.</p>

<p align="center"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>: Media Text Hack</strong></span><br />
<em>by project lead Matt McGregor</em></p>
<p>In the middle of 2013, a few New Zealand academics and librarians began to toss around an exciting-but-preposterous-sounding idea: what if they could hack a media studies textbook in a weekend, and then release the results to the world under an open Creative Commons license?</p>
<p>The social benefit â€“ the why â€“ was clear. With textbook prices continuing to rise (and rise) well above inflation, and student debt levels ballooning, the Pacific region desperately needs a new model for producing and distributing educational resources. As Dr Erika Pearson, who led the Media Text Hack project, put it, â€œTextbooks currently available for New Zealand first year students are often produced overseas, usually the US, and can have a cripplingly high price tag.â€</p>
<p>The how was a bit more difficult. Academics and librarians are already rather busy people, and the process of building and managing a team of contributors is labor intensive, with plenty of emailing, documenting, cat-herding, and problem-solving. Thankfully, with the help of a $4000 affiliate grant from Creative Commons, the team could hire a project manager -- Bernard Madill -- to help build the network of contributors, document progress, and make sure the hack weekend progressed smoothly.</p>
<p>Cut to 16-17 November, 2013: the team, largely made up of early career researchers from across New Zealand and Australia, got together and successfully produced the 'beta' version of the textbook. For the last few months, they have been progressively editing and re-editing content, to ensure that the textbook is classroom ready in time for the first down-under semester, which starts in late February. </p>
<p>As the book is shared, edited, and reused by students and teachers across the world, the team will incorporate new ideas, explanations, and examples, producing a text that can be hacked and re-hacked over the years ahead.</p>
<p>This is new territory: while there have been a few textbooks hacks in other disciplines â€“ including <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34643">this inspirational group of Finnish mathematicians</a> â€“ this is of the first (to our knowledge) of this kind of text-hack in the humanities.</p>
<p>For this reason, the team is putting together a parallel 'cookbook', to enable other projects to understand what worked â€“ as well as what did not work â€“ about the project. This will be released in the first half of 2014, and will hopefully inspire other projects around the world to attempt open textbook projects of their own.</p>
<p>The team is hopeful that open textbooks will become more prevalent in public higher education. As University of Otago Copyright Officer Richard White, a core member of the text-hack team, puts it, the open textbook marks a return to the â€œcore principles of academia: sharing knowledge, learning from, and building on the work of others.â€</p>

<em>by project lead Tyng-Ruey Chuang</em></p>
<p>The project "Practices and Depositories for The Public Domain" (PD4PD) aims to develop software tools and practical guidelines to put public domain materials online more easily. This is a joint uptake of the GNU MediaGoblin project [1], NETivism Ltd. [2], and Creative Commons Taiwan [3], with the latter coordinating the team effort. The overall project goal is to firm up access to and reuse of the many digital manifestations of public domain cultural works by means of replicable tools, practices, and communities. </p>
<p>Tools: The plan is to extend the functionality of the GNU MediaGoblin software package so as to make it more suitable for hosting large collections of public domain materials. For this purpose, new features have been suggested to add to GNU MediaGoblin to help users self-hosting their media archives. These features include batch upload of media (with proper metadata annotations), customizable themes and pages, and an "easy install" script (to install GNU Media Goblin itself). </p>
<p>Practices: The plan is to develop guidelines and how-to on self-hosting public domain materials. Two versions are planned: One in English and the other one in the Chinese language used in Taiwan. An educational website on the public domain, and self-hosting, is also planned.</p>
<p>Community: The plan is to outreach to content holders in Taiwan, and  to work with them in releasing some of their holdings to the public domain. It will be demonstrated by a website using the tools mentioned above. </p>
<p>This six-month project started in December 2013 and plans to finish in June 2014. The GNU MediaGoblin project has been focusing on tool development while NETivism Ltd. is concentrating on community outreach. Creative Commons Taiwan is working on practical guidelines. Several interns have been recruited to help with this project.</p>
