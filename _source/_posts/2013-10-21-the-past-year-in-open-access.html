<p>Today marks the start of <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week 2013</a>. Open Access Week is a global event for the academic and research community to continue to learn about the potential benefits of <a href="http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm">Open Access</a>, to share what theyâ€™ve learned with colleagues, and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make Open Access a new norm in scholarship and research. There are many <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/events">events</a> you can participate in this week, both in person and virtually. Now is a great time to take a look back at the last year in open access developments. Hereâ€™s a small sample.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The European Commission <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-786_en.htm">released a report</a> that said open access to research publications is reaching a tipping point. It noted that 40% of scientific peer reviewed articles published worldwide between 2004 and 2011 are now available online for free access. </li>
<li>CC developed a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/39707">set of graphics</a> that help explain the the current commercial publishing situation and what an open access would do to promote increased access and reuse to research.</li>
<li>The Public Library of Science and Figshare <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36504">announced a partnership</a> that will allow authors publishing in PLOS journals host their data on Figshare.</li>
<li>In the United States, the <a href="http://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/2013%2002%2014%20DOYLE%20FASTR%20FINAL.pdf">Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act</a> (FASTR) was <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36699">introduced</a> in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. FASTR requires federal agencies with annual extramural research budgets of $100 million or more to provide the public with online access to the research articles stemming from that funded research no later than six months after publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</li>
<li>The White House issued a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35267">directive on public access to research</a> produced by federal agencies. Each agency covered by the Directive must â€œEnsure that the public can read, download, and analyze in digital form final peer reviewed manuscripts or final published documents within a timeframe that is appropriate for each type of research conducted or sponsored by the agency.â€ The public is still waiting to see the details of the agency public access plans, which were due August 22, 2013. In addition, the White House announced an <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/38269">executive order in support of open data</a>, and launched <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">Project Open Data</a>, an open source initiative looking for input and collaboration on how the federal government should manage open data. Thereâ€™s been some great work to-date on Project Open Data, but thereâ€™s still some <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/38316">unresolved questions</a> about licensing (or public domain tools) appropriate for data produced by the federal government. </li>
<li>Also in the United States, thereâ€™s been several <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/37830">state-level bills</a> introduced in support of public access to publicly funded research. Perhaps the most active is the legislation introduced in California--AB 609--the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/37882">California Taxpayer Access to Publicly Funded Research Act</a>. If you live in California you can <a href="http://www.congressweb.com/SPARC/19">write to your representatives</a> today to tell them to support AB 609.</li>
<li>The University of California passed a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/39246">system-wide open access policy</a>. The open access policy will cover 8,000 faculty who author approximately 40,000 articles each year.</li>
<li>The Research Councils UK passed an open access policy, but thereâ€™s been some <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36572 ">confusion</a> about the open licensing provisions in the policy. And, the Business, Innovation, and Skills Committee <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/11/open-access-report-bis-committee">released a report</a> criticizing the policy and urged RCUK to reconsider several aspects of the policy, including the preference for gold open access publishing, acceptable embargo periods, and licensing options. </li>
<li>PLOS hosted the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/38011 ">Accelerating Science Award Program</a> (ASAP). The high-profile award program seeked to highlight individuals who have used, applied, or remixed scientific research â€” published through open access â€” in order to realize innovations in science, medicine, and technology. The winners of the program will be <a href="http://live.worldbank.org/open-access-week-2013">announced today</a>!</li>
</ul>
