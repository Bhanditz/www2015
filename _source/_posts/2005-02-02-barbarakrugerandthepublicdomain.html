<p>Last night <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#32">Francesca</a> and I went to see the artist <a href="http://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/kruger/">Barbara Kruger</a> speak at the <a href="http://www.collegeprofiles.com/sanfranart.html">San Francisco Art Institute</a>. Kruger is known for, among other things, stark photo-and-text collages that appropriate the language of consumer culture to comment on it.</p>
<p>After the talk, Francesca (our resident art expert) gave Kruger a Creative Commons t-shirt and explained what it is we do.</p>
<p>"Oh, sounds like Lawrence Lessig," Kruger said.</p>
<p>"He's our chairman," Francesca and I said in unison.</p>
<p>"Wow, if you have to have a hero, he's as good as anyone I can think of," she said. "Please tell him that I use his book to teach my grad school courses."</p>
<p>Having endured and prevailed in <a href="http://www.ncac.org/artlaw/sum-hoe.html">a copyright litigation</a> (over the image above), Kruger can appreciate the benefits of free culture.</p>
