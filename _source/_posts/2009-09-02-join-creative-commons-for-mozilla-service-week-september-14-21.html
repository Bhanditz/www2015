<p><a href="http://mozillaservice.org">Mozilla Service Week</a> is happening September 14-21, 2009, and during that week Mozilla is trying to bring people together to help teach one another about the web.  Creative Commons is answering Mozilla's call for participation by hosting an online help desk via our IRC channel.  Our IRC channel (#cc on the <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode network</a>) is typically a place where our developers and people interested in the technology of CC hang out.  During Service Week we're inviting everyone to join us there for a virtual CC help desk.</p>
<p>The CC help desk is a place for experienced CC-ers (staff, Jurisdiction partners, and community members), to come together to share their collective expertise with those that are new to CC and need a little, or a lot, of guidance.</p>
<p>The CC community will be providing help with the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>General CC help</li>
<li>CC technology (<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/ccREL">ccREL</a> and software projects)</li>
<li>Where and how to publish CC works</li>
<li>Where and how to find CC works</li>
<li>CC in education and science </li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like to help out, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Mozilla_Service_Week#I_Want_To_Help.21">add your name</a> to our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Mozilla_Service_Week">Mozilla Service Week wiki page</a> and <a href="http://mozillaservice.org/tell_us/your_pledge/">pledge your hours</a> at mozillaservice.org.  If you have questions, join the channel during Service Week and ask a volunteer.  </p>
<p>More information can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Mozilla_Service_Week">wiki page</a>,</p>
