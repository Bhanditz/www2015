<p>Cellphone ringtones were a $3 billion business last year, but a new bit of software from <a href="http://xingtone.com/">Xingtone</a> finally makes it possible to easily create your own sounds. I always thought much of <a href="http://opsound.org/opsound/pool.html">the Opsound archive</a> would make good ringtones. It'll be interesting to see if more CC music makes its way onto phones everywhere.</p>
<p>In other CC-in-other-media news, some people working on MythTV (a sort of open source TiVo that can run on any linux PC) are trying to find ways to <a href="http://mythtv.org/pipermail/mythtv-dev/2004-May/022053.html">import movies from the Internet Archive and under CC license to their TV systems</a>.</p>
