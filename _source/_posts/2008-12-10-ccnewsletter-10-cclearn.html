<p>December's newsletter features <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org">ccLearn</a>, the education branch of Creative Commons which has grown substantially this year and has a lot of exciting plans lined up for its bright future as a leader in the open education movement. The newsletter also brings to you news highlights from each of CC's other program areas.</p>
<p>As you'll see in this newsletter, we have begun experimenting with a new format as a way to bring you the latest CC news in a more manageable way, so check out #10 and see what you think! As always, many thanks to the <a href="http://philippinecommons.org/">CC Philippines team</a> for designing the PDF version.</p>
