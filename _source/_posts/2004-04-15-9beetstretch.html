<p>Here's an interesting use of music in the public domain. <a href="http://www.notam02.no/9/">9 beet stretch</a> is the act of using digital tools to slow down Beethoven's 9th symphony to the point where the piece takes 24 hours to complete. Next week, <a href="http://www.quietamerican.org/9beet.html">a 9 beet stretch will be taking place in San Francisco</a>, at 964 Natoma, from Friday April 23rd to Saturday April 24. </p>
