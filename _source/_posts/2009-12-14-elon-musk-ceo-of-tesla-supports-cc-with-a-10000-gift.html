<p>We are delighted to announce the generous support of Elon Musk, <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/media/company_board.php">CEO of Tesla Motors</a> and CEO/CTO of <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>, who has given $10,000 to this year's annual fundraising campaign. We are honored to receive this gift, which will have a great impact in helping us reach our $500,000 goal this year. We rely very much on the generosity of innovators and leaders who recognize the importance of participatory culture and CC's work promoting openness and collaboration, and we're thrilled to have Elon's support this year. </p>
<p>His gift, and the gifts of <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">so many others</a> who have given whatever they can in support of Creative Commons during this campaign, will go far in sustaining CC as an organization, keeping our tools free for everyone to use, and allowing us to continue our work facilitating a global participatory culture. </p>
<p>Many thanks again to Elon for his generosity. If you see the value and importance in CC's work, I hope you will consider joining Elon by giving back to CC in whatever capacity you are able and <strong><a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate today</a></strong>!</p>
