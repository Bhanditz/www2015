<p>Creative Commons is hiring a software engineer for our technology team, based in San Francisco. The ideal candidate would have experience in a few key areas (Python, Linux, web development) and the ability to learn quickly.  Interest in the semantic web doesn't hurt, either.  See the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#engineer">job description</a> for application details.  We'll begin reviewing resumes and scheduling interviews May 15, 2009.</p>
