<p><a href="http://www.revolverbook.co.uk/"><i>Abracadabra!</i></a> by Ray Newman is a new e-book that tells the story behind the making of the Beatles' masterpiece, the 1966 album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver_%28album%29">Revolver.</a> The book is available for free download and is being offered to the world under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.5/">Attribution-NoDerivs</a> license. Newman says that he plans to publish an expanded second edition of the book next year, and is <a href="http://www.revolverbook.co.uk/help.html">inviting the public to help.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>My aim is to produce a free, good quality history of the making of Revolver which doesn't (a) rely entirely on regurgitating chunks of other books or (b) unsubstaniated opinion. This has made the job harder than it might have been, but also a lot more fun.</p></blockquote>
