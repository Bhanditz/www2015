<p>If you're a fan of photo-and-knowledge-sharing community <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/">Fotopedia</a>, you've likely heard that the site is closing this Sunday, August 10. When Creative Commons heard the news, we contacted Fotopedia to ask if there were some way that we could help save all of the Creative Commons&#8211;licensed photos on the site. Now, we're working together with the staff at Fotopedia to create a new archive of all of that content. At the same time, our friends at Archive Team are <a href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Fotopedia">creating a copy of the entire Fotopedia website</a>.</p>
<p>Here at CC, we've been big fans of Fotopedia for a long time. The site elegantly mixes together content from Flickr, Wikipedia, and other sources in a way that's only possible thanks to CC licenses. And over the years, Fotopedia developed an amazing community of people curating all of that content into highly entertaining, visually rich albums.</p>
<p>It's fitting that all of that work will live on in the new archive. Fotopedia has always been a great example of the power of the decentralized web. Just like Fotopedia brought new life to great photos from Flickr, the archive will bring new life to great photos from Fotopedia.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know when the archive is open, <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/civicrm/mailing/subscribe">subscribe to our mailing list.</a>. If you have any questions, email us at <a href="info@creativecommons.org">info@creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
<p>Creative Commons salutes Fotopedia for its work as a leader in online content-sharing. We wish Jean-Marie Hullot and his team all the best on their future projects.</p>
