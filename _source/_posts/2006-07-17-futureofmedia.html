<p>The <a href="http://futureexploration.net/blog/">Future Exploration Network</a> recently published a <a href="http://www.futureexploration.net/blog/2006/07/launching_the_future_of_media_1.html">report on the future of media</a> (<a href="http://www.futureexploration.net/fom06/Future_of_Media_Report2006.pdf">pdf</a>) that touches on many trends relevant to Creative Commons, including Creative Commons (and the report itself is CC licensed, of course):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Intellectual property and media</strong></p>
<p>The Future of Media Strategic Framework is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike<br />
                                       2.5 License. This means that while Future Exploration Network retains copyright you can use it â€“ even<br />
                                       for commercial purposes â€“ as long as you attribute it to the creator. It also means, that if you think it<br />
                                      should be different or want to improve on it, you can do so as long as you release it under the same<br />
                                    license â€“ feel free to do so! There are a plethora of dilemmas and thorny issues for media organizations to<br />
                                  resolve in how they protect their own content, as well as license user-submitted content. Locking content<br />
                               down will in many cases prove to be less valuable than allowing it to be reused appropriately by other content<br />
                         creators. A living content landscape benefits content creators far more than a rigid world.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategic questions:</em></strong><br />
<br /><em>What licenses do you offer for user-submitted content?</em><br />
<br /><em>In which situations should media-generated content have Creative Commons or similar licenses that allow reuse and adaptation?</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm giving a twenty minute presentation on Creative Commons and the future of media at a Future Exploration Network summit tomorrow evening in San Francisco.  Fortunately it looks like I won't need to spend much time on the basics!</p>
