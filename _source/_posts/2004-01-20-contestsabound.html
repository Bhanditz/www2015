<p>Participatory creativity is hot, hot.  The Lollapoola <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=lollapalooza+mash-up+contest&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Mash-Up Contest</a>. Our Own GET CREATIVE! <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contest/">Moving Images Contest</a> (winners to be announced next month). MoveOn.org's <a href="http://bushin30seconds.com/">Bush in 30 Seconds</a> advertisement contest. And now even the <a href="http://newyorker.com">New Yorker</a> has <a href="http://newyorker.com/online/content/?040126on_onlineonly01">announced the winner</a> of its own analog-version of an open-source creativity contest, which was more interactive than contests past. (Devoted New Yorker fans will want to watch the great <a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/newyorker/slideshows/captioncontest.html#">slide show</a> explaining the judging process.)</p>
<p>I don't remember the New Yorker's ever explaining the copyright policy for this. Who gets to keep the rights to the final cartoon? Can we re-use those little screwdriver or dog cut-outs for other purposes? And given that it's cut-outs we're talking about, how does first sale doctrine tie in to all this?</p>
<p>Clearly the average New Yorker reader --  or editor -- isn't as persnickety about their IP as some of us. Maybe next year they'll go CC.</p>
