<p>Some of you may already be familiar with the term open ed, short for open educationâ€”which represents the fantastic movement around opening up educational resources so that anyone, anywhere, can access, use, and derive existing educational materials in new, creative ways or to simply adapt them to their unique individual needs and local contexts. There are so many great educational materials out thereâ€”some already openly licensed and a great deal more in the public domainâ€”and the problem is that a lot of people still donâ€™t know about them or how to use them. Similarly, the open education movement has produced some really exciting projects and programs in recent years, but there is no global landing space for these inspiring movers and shakers to really connect as a coherent community.</p>
<p><a id="h.-q" title="Open Ed" href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Main_Page">Open Ed</a>, the new Open Education Community site, is the result of brainstorming with other initiatives in the movement on how to provide such a space. We designed the site for open education community members, but also for teachers, learners, and those who just want to get involved. We were able to build it thanks to the strong support of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.</p>
<p><a id="d:ja" title="Open Ed" href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Main_Page">Open Ed</a> is hosted by <a id="tywh" title="ccLearn" href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/">ccLearn</a>, but we are merely providing the web space. Weâ€™ve done some initial work on it, but the site is yoursâ€”be you an OER advocate, a teacher wanting to connect with other teachers, or a learner who would love to do the same. And you can contribute in any way you like, because Open Ed runs on MediaWiki, the same software that powers Wikipedia. Additionally, Open Ed utilizes the <a id="j3vs" title="Semantic MediaWiki extension" href="http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki">Semantic MediaWiki extension</a> to enable data querying and analysis. For added functionality, we have installed <a id="ina7" title="various other useful extensions" href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Special:Version">various other useful extensions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Waitâ€¦ hasnâ€™t this site been up for a while?</strong></p>
<p>Youâ€™re right; itâ€™s been public on the web for a couple of months now. Some of you may already have accounts. <a id="vpf4" title="Others" href="http://zaidlearn.blogspot.com/2009/04/open-education-community-is.html">Others</a> <a id="k9zx" title="have" href="http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=48639&amp;format=html">have</a> even blogged about it previously. But we havenâ€™t made the official announcement launch until now because we wanted to get some initial feedback from existing community members. So we need your help! Please spread the word, via your personal and professional channelsâ€”and most of all, use the space for what you need to do! Itâ€™s a wiki. That means you can create a page for your own project, add your project to <a id="qsy:" title="ODEPO" href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/ODEPO">ODEPO</a> (the Open Database of Educational Projects and Organizations) for others to find, run your own data query for research purposes, or do virtually anything else you deem necessary to strengthen and promote open education, including translating the entire site into other languages. Not to mention that content is a little lacking right now, and itâ€™s up to us to make it a great landing place for newbies to open education.</p>
<p><strong>Give us feedback!</strong></p>
<p>Please <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/contact" target="_blank">let us know</a> what you think. Anyone can add to or improve the space by simply clicking â€œeditâ€, but as the hosts of this space, we would love to help with the process. You can also share your thoughts on Twitter with an <a id="av_3" title="#opened" href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23opened">#opened</a> hashtag.</p>
<p>Lastly, thanks to <a href="http://whitewhale.net/" target="_blank">White Whale</a>, an Oakland-based consulting, design, and development company, who designed Open Ed and helped us with some of our messaging points.</p>
<p>Happy exploring!</p>
