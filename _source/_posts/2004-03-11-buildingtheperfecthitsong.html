<p>This is interesting news for musicians -- you know how some songs are really catchy and you wonder if the hooks could be engineered to make people like the song? A company called Polyphonic HMI has created software they call "<a href="http://www.hitsongscience.com/">Hit Song Science</a>" which is supposed to contain algorithms that determine if a song is likely to be a hit. The company is touting <a href="http://mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=63782">their first attempt at using HSS in the marketplace as a success</a>.
