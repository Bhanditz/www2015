A month ago, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3852">we mentioned the emerging "mob spots" phenomena</a>, and how Creative Commons licenses might play a role. It looks like the folks at MoveOn.org have come close to the goals laid out in our earlier post. They're doing <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/">a 30-second spot contest</a>, with <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/rules.html">all entries licensed</a> under Attribution, Non-commercial, No Derivative Works. This should allow anyone to copy, share, and mirror the movies without any legal hassles.</p>
<p>
It's also similar to the rules for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contest/">our Moving Images Contest</a>, which you have just two months left to submit entries for.</p>
