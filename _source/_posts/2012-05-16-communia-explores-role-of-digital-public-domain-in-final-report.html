<p>From 2007 to 2011, COMMUNIA was a project funded by the European Commission to explore the role of the public domain in the digital age. Over four years, <a href="http://communia-project.eu">COMMUNIA</a>, or The European Thematic Network on the Digital Public Domain, gathered over 50 members from academia and the CC community to research, promote, and preserve the digital public domain. In 2011, COMMUNIA's members decided to continue the network as an <a href="http://www.communia-association.org/">international nonprofit association</a>. </p>
<p>We would like to highlight two recent publications by COMMUNIA that shed light on COMMUNIA's progress:</p>
<p>In April, COMMUNIA released, "<a href="http://www.communia-association.org/2012/04/14/the-digital-public-domain-foundations-for-an-open-culture/">The Digital Public Domain: Foundations for an Open Culture</a>" under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This book brings together essays by academics, librarians, entrepreneurs, activists and policy makers, who were all part of the EU-funded Communia project [from 2007-2011]. Together the authors argue that the Public Domain â€” that is, the informational works owned by all of us, be that literature, music, the output of scientific research, educational material or public sector information â€” is fundamental to a healthy society."</p></blockquote>
<p>More recently, COMMUNIA published its <a href="http://communia-project.eu/final-report/">Final Report</a>, also under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This Public Report is the outcome of the work of the COMMUNIA Network on the Digital Public Domain (hereinafter â€œCOMMUNIAâ€). This Report was undertaken to (i) review the activities of COMMUNIA; (ii) investigate the state of the digital public domain in Europe; and (iii) recommend policy strategies for enhancing a healthy public domain and making digital content in Europe more accessible and usable. Each of the subjects indicated above will be further developed and detailed in Annex I, Annex II, and Annex III of this Report, respectively."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Final Report, along with the collection of essays above, highlights much of the good work completed by COMMUNIA over the years, including <a href="http://publicdomainmanifesto.org/">The Public Domain Manifesto</a>, of which many CC affiliates, staff, and community members were a part of drafting.</p>
