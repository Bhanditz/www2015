<p>When we published <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0/Draft_3">Draft 3</a> of Version 4.0 of the CC license suite in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36713">February</a>, we reminded our community that the ensuing consultation period would be its final chance to comment on the licenses before publication. The publication of that draft and reminder caused some stakeholders and others in our affiliate network to take a final hard look at the legal code. This was also the trigger for us here at CC to conduct one last review as planned.  After all, one of our foremost <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29639">goals</a> has been to develop a long-lasting suite of licenses that will carry us as far into the future as possible. If there are some improvements we can make now and that will avoid problems later, then we ought take the time to account for those when possible.</p>
<p>That our publication caused the legal code to undergo this final level of scrutiny is the good news. We were also able to have a concluding discussion with our affiliates face-to-face during the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/39383">2013 Global Summit in Buenos Aires</a> last week. There, we received valuable input from those in attendance about the final draft of the licenses.</p>
<p>The unfortunate news is the ensuing delay. For those eager to move from 3.0 to 4.0&#160;&#8212; and there are many of you who have been waiting patiently&#160;&#8212; we recognize that the delay is a source of frustration. We are excited to say that the wait will pay dividends for everyone; however, the community identified a few important issues and we're working together to address those issues in the upcoming draft. We'll be expanding more on those when we publish the draft, slated for next week.</p>
<p>For those of you interested in commenting on the final draft, take note that the consultation period will be abbreviated, no longer than two weeks. The bulk of the changes are not substantive and do not involve a shift in policy. Instead, they involve further refinements and simplification in language when possible, consolidation of the <em>sui generis</em> database rights provisions into a single section for ease of reference, and similar improvements. The remainder will be concisely framed and explained, and we don't expect them to be controversial.</p>
<p>Watch this space and our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">4.0 wiki</a> for the final drafts of the licenses next week. Thanks again for your patience and support. We're close!</p>
