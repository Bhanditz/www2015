<p>Two upcoming speaking engagements that should be fun, at least for me...</p>
<p>Next week <a href="http://www.balug.org">Bay Area Linux Users Group</a> in San Francisco. This should be fun because I've attended a bunch of BALUG meetings, mostly in the last decade, and due to location and great volunteers their <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-user-groups-lug-51/bruce-perens-balug-feb-19th-615385/">speakers</a> are a who's who of open source, and my talk will include some material I covered at LugRadio Live USA in a talk a few months ago, which I think makes a number of points that ought to be better known regarding where free culture is relative to free software/open source. I'd love comments. See the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9027969209113700891">LugRadio video</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mlinksva/lugradio-live-usa-2008-creative-commons">slides</a> or better yet <a href="http://www.balug.org/#Meetings%20(upcoming)">come to BALUG next week</a>.</p>
<p>August 4 I'll speak at the <a href="http://www.dcia.info/activities/p2pmssv2008/">Distributed Computing Industry Association's P2P Media Summit Silicon Valley</a> in San Jose, exact topic to be determined. I'm really pleased to be speaking here, as in the past I've found distributed computing/P2P conferences to have the highest idea quotient of any in the vicinity (e.g., the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/p2p_sf01/">first O'Reilly P2P conference</a> in 2001, which eventually turned into ETech, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeCon">CodeCon</a>) and I think there are many interesting questions and latent opportunities for P2P with the free/open world and vice versa -- last year I barely touched on several of these in a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mlinksva/technologies-for-free-culture-world-domination-workshop-20070617/">workshop at the iSummit</a>, and I really look forward to digging into these.</p>
<p>DCIA is offering a special member rate to P2P Media Summit attendees referred by Creative Commons. Regular conference registration is <a href="http://www.dcia.info/activities/p2pmssv2008/register.html">here</a>. To get the special rate call DCIA Business Affairs/Sari Lafferty, contact information on the <a href="http://www.dcia.info/activities/p2pmssv2008/">conference home page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to BALUG and DCIA!</p>
<p>Between these events and elsewhere, CC will be heavily represented at the very important <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2008/06/04/esof-2008-satellite-event-collaborating-for-the-future-of-open-science/">Euroscience Open Forum</a> (Barcelona), <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2857">OSCON</a> (Portland),  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8435">CC Salon New York</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8439">iSummit'08</a> (Sapporo). And I have to mention <a href="http://wikimania2008.wikimedia.org">Wikimania</a> (Alexandria), which I will attend ... sadly, next year, though there will probably be no more interesting and relevant conference in this time period.</p>
