The legendary mashup <a href="http://www.djztrip.com/bio.html">DJ Z-Trip</a> has released a new mix under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution license</a> intended to help garner support for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Z-Trip's <em>Obama Mix</em> is a recording of the set he's been playing at recent fundraisers he's organized with the artist Shepard Fairey (creator of the ubiquitous <a href="http://obeygiant.com/">OBEY</a> campaign and more recently, the Obama <a href="http://current.com/items/89394032_shepard_fairey_for_obama">HOPE</a> posters). Z-Trip wants you to push the mix as far and wide as possible so it makes sense he chose our least restrictive license:</p>
<blockquote><p>I encourage you to download it and pass it along to anyone you think should hear it. Feel free to burn copies, share it with friends, family, co-workers, strangers, and especially anyone you know is on the fence about this election. I'm also putting out a radio friendly version, in case anyone wants to broadcast it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regardless of your political affiliation, the mix deserves a listen for anyone interested in political speech and sound.  <a href="http://www.djztrip.com/obama/">Download Z-Trip's mix here</a>.</p>
