<p><a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12135" title="Al Jazeera Creative Commons Repository" src="img/ccaljazeera.png" alt="Al Jazeera Creative Commons Repository" width="200" height="168" /></a>Al Jazeera is releasing 12 broadcast quality videos today shot in Gaza under Creative Commons' <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">least restrictive Attribution license</a>. Each professionally recorded video <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/node/29">has a detailed information page</a> and is hosted on <a href="http://www.blip.tv">blip.tv</a> allowing for easy downloads of the original files and integration into <a href="http://www.getmiro.com">Miro</a>.  The value of this footage is best described by <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/11/technology/jazeera.php">an <em>International Herald Tribune/New York Times</em> article describing the release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a conflict where the Western news media have been largely prevented from reporting from Gaza because of restrictions imposed by the Israeli military, Al Jazeera has had a distinct advantage. It was already there.</p></blockquote>
<p>More importantly, the permissive CC-BY license means that the footage can be used by anyone including, rival broadcasters, documentary makers, and bloggers, so long as Al Jazeera is credited.</p>
<p>There's more information over at <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net">Al Jazeera's CC repository</a>, and in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/12166">press release</a>. You can also add the Al Jazeera repository to your Miro feeds by <a href="http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http://aljazeeraasset.blip.tv/rss">clicking here</a>.</p>
