<p><a href="http://acawiki.org">AcaWiki</a>, a project I briefly mentioned in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17980">Opening Education--the little things you can do</a>, launches this week. Dubbed as the "Wikipedia for academic research," AcaWikiâ€™s mission is "to make academic research more accessible and interactive" by "[enabling] users to easily post and discuss human-readable summaries of academic papers and literature reviews online." Founder Neeru Paharia (a doctoral candidate at Harvard Business School) explains that "cutting-edge research is often locked behind firewalls and therefore lacks impact. AcaWiki turns research hidden in academic journals into something that is more dynamic and accessible to have a greater influence in scholarship, and society."</p>
<p>From <a href="http://acawiki.org/AcaWiki:PressRelease-2009-10-07">the press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"AcaWikiâ€™s work follows on the work of open-access publishers such as the Public Library of Science, as well as on the tradition of using new media to create public dialogue with science. Currently, it can cost up to $35 to download an academic paperâ€”a significant cost, especially because thorough research on any topic usually entails downloading many papers. <strong>AcaWikiâ€™s approach takes advantage of the fact that copyright does not apply to ideas, only to the written expression of those ideas. </strong>Scholars can thus post summaries of their or othersâ€™ research online as long as they are not copying verbatim beyond what fair-use laws permit. John Seely Brown, former head of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and a leader in the open education movement, says, "AcaWiki complements [the movementâ€™s] work and opens a whole new dimension of making research accessible to the public."</p></blockquote>
<p>Like <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org">OpenEd</a>, <a href="http://acawiki.org/">AcaWiki</a> is "built using Semantic MediaWiki, combining the sophistication of the semantic web with the ease-of-use of a wiki. The site enables comments, discussion, user profiles, and tagging." All AcaWiki content is available via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>.</p>
<p>AcaWiki also has some supporters in common with ccLearn and CC. Not only is AcaWiki starting with seed funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, but its board members include Mike Linksvayer, vice president of Creative Commons, and John Wilbanks, vice president of Science Commons.</p>
