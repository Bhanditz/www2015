<p>The <a href="http://surj.stanford.edu">Stanford Undergraduate Research Journal</a>, a very impressive student-run academic publication here, has published its third volume under a Creative Commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike license. I got to speak at SURJ's annual awards event this week on Stanford's campus, and the group's enthusiasm for open-access research was inspiring.</p>
