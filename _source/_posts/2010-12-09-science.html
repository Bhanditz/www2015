<p>Since 2004, Creative Commons has maintained an active presence in the sciences. We believe that our vision -  of an internet that reaches its full potential through open systems - must extend to scientific and technical research.</p>
<p>To support scientific benefits via the commons, we work in three core projects: increased access to the scholarly record via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_(publishing)">Open Access</a>, supporting the emerging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science_data">Open Data</a> movement, and research and development into how the Creative Commons methodology can be applied beyond the copyright. These three projects echo our mission of developing, supporting, and stewarding legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes creativity, sharing, and innovation.</p>
<p>Open Access - The <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/">Scholars' Copyright Project</a><br />
We work to increase the usage of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/">Creative Commons copyright licenses</a> in the scholarly journal publishing business. Based on analysis of the <a href="http://www.doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>, CC licenses are used by more than 70% of titles and articles from the 14 largest Open Access publishers, while more than 20% of the 1600 titles from â€œsmallâ€ Open Access Publishers use our licenses. CC licenses cover approximately 2000 titles in all, representing around 10% of the worldâ€™s entire output of scholarly journals as of late 2010.</p>
<p>(Our data comes from the Study of Open Access Publishing, a two-year project funded by the European Commission. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0506">Read and download the a pre-print of the first results</a> results in press at the Public Library of Science)</p>
<p>See how the <a href="http://www.plos.org/oa/definition.php">Public Library of Science</a>, <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/copyright">BioMed Central</a>, <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/about.html">Hindawi</a>, and <a href="http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html">Nature Publishing Group</a> are helping realize the full power of the scientific internet via Creative Commons licenses. </p>
<p>Our licenses also underpin the emerging world of science blogs. <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/about/">PLoS Blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.science3point0.com/">Science 3.0</a>, </p>
<p>We also work to increase Open Access via the usage of the Creative Commons copyright licenses in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_repository">institutional repositories</a> at research institutions, where individual faculty members upload copies of articles and other academic works. Creative Commons licenses are directly integrated into the leading software platforms for institutional repositories (notably <a href="http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace </a>and <a href="http://www.eprints.org/">ePrints</a>) and dozens of university libraries offer access to our <a href="http://scholars.sciencecommons.org/">Scholarâ€™s Copyright Addendum Engine</a>, which helps authors retain the rights they need to use the copyright license they want.</p>
<p>(try out the SCAE at <a href="http://info-libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/mit-open-access/open-access-at-mit/mit-amendment-form/mit-amendment-tool/">MIT</a>, <a href="http://openaccess.jhmi.edu/addendum_engine.cfm">Johns Hopkins</a>, or <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/scholarly-communications/Copyright%20Management/index.html">Carnegie Mellon University</a>)</p>
<p>We don't just work on legal tools. We also develop and distribute <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/advocacy/nih/copyright.shtml">policy briefings</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/opendoors_v1.pdf">implementation guidelines</a> to help institutions exploring Open Access options and policies. </p>

<p>Open Data<br />
Science@CC explores the use of Creative Commons copyright licenses and other legal tools on scientific data, ranging from database rights to privacy. We work to increase Open Data through adoption of our licenses and tools in large open scientific projects, with successful implementations in <a href="http://www.eol.org/">taxonomic</a>, <a href="http://en.openei.org/wiki/Main_Page">energy</a>, <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/">genomics</a>, <a href="http://sagebase.org">disease research</a>, <a href="http://wiki.americaview.org/display/miview/Home">geospatial</a>, <a href="http://www.polarcommons.org/">polar</a>, and <a href="http://openbiblio.net/2010/11/17/jisc-openbibliography-british-library-data-release/">bilbiometric</a> disciplines. We also provide expert guidance on Open Data to funders, institutions, private foundations, governments, the corporate sector, and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>R&amp;D<br />
Science@CC has developed and deployed CC-inspired legal tools for<a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/licensing/"> transferring biological materials</a>, and maintains an active research project into the potential roles that <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Patent_Tools_Public_Discussion">standardized licensing and open data might play in the patent system</a>. Our early adopters include the <a href="http://personalgenomes.org">Personal Genome Project</a>, with 1,000 lines of stem cells licensed under a liberal Creative Commons Materials Transfer Agreement,<a href="http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/CHDI/?SsId=45"> CHDI's repository of Huntingtons Disease research tools</a>, and the <a href="http://greenxchange.cc/">GreenXchange project</a>.</p>

<p>We also support a wide variety of users interested in the sciences and the digital commons, including <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/how-can-science-commons-help-me/libraries/">libraries</a>, <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/how-can-science-commons-help-me/research-foundations/">research funders</a>, <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/how-can-science-commons-help-me/authors-and-publishers/">publishers</a>, and<a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/how-can-science-commons-help-me/technology-transfer-professionals/"> technology transfer professionals</a>.</p>
