<p>When we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249">launched version 3.0</a> of the CC licenses February 23 we also switched on a number of graphical, language, and technical updates. This is the first of a very tardy series of posts about those updates.</p>
<p>Creative Commons license deeds are the "human readable" explanation of the "lawyer readable" licenses (e.g., see the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 deed</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode">Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 legalcode</a>) and have always (see Attribution-ShareAlike 1.0 as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031008161412/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">captured by the Internet Archive in 2003</a>) used icons to represent the requirements and prohibitions associated with a license.</p>
<p>Coinciding with 3.0 we've started using icons to call out the freedoms granted with a license:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"><img src="img/share-remix-deed-icons.png" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The "remix" building blocks icon is derived from the <a href="http://freeculture.org">FreeCulture.org</a> logo:</p>
<p><a href="http://freeculture.org"><img src="img/freeculture.png" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks for the great idea!</p>
<p>FreeCulture.org is "an international student movement for free culture" and a great way to get involved. Check out their <a href="http://freeculture.org/involved.php">suggestions</a> ranging from 5 minute projects to starting your own chapter.</p>
<p>We've featured FreeCulture.org events a number of times on this blog, including a recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7246">Creative Commons art show</a> by Free Culture Florida.</p>
