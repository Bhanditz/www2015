<p>I promise to keep this short. I wanted to share a note we received from CC donor Dorothea Salo:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was a librarian hired to run an institutional repository, CC licenses helped me cut through copyright thickets with worried-but-interested faculty. CC&#8217;s unwavering support for free culture, and promotion of its benefits, demonstrated every day to often-skeptical, occasionally-hostile workplaces that I was not alone in working for openness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dorothea, you&#8217;re <em>not</em> alone. The Creative Commons community fights for open because we&#8217;ve seen its impact in the worlds of culture, education, science, and more. We choose open because open works.</p>
<p>As some of you know, I will be leaving my role as CEO of Creative Commons at the end of February. My greatest CC experiences have been meeting members of the community and learning about the countless innovative ways you use CC licenses. You give our tools meaning by using them to change the world.</p>
<p>Alas, before I go, I have a final request. The Brin Wojcicki Foundation is matching every donation CC receives in January. That means now is the perfect time to <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog7&utm_medium=blog">make a donation to Creative Commons</a>. We have some fun gifts for donors (people are really loving the Team Open trading cards), but much more importantly, we will use your investment to fight harder and more strategically than ever for a more open world.</p>
<p>While the CEO is changing, our vision of universal access to knowledge and culture is as rock solid as ever. Realizing that vision is more important today than it&#8217;s ever been.</p>
<p>With warmest regards,<br />Cathy</p>
