<div><span style="font-size: small">In the spirit of Creative Commons Salons -- global, informal events focused on bringing together the community around a central topic or focus -- Science Commons will be holding a day-long event this February in Seattle. The event will aim to bring a broader understanding on the term "open" and all of its flavors when applied to science. From Open Access publishing and data sharing efforts, to more transparent ways to conduct bench science and the various "open"s (data, science, access) - the benefits of implementing "open" approaches to science are not only gaining visibility but also generating a buzz in the community.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small">Â </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small">We have brought together an all-star list of experts and leading minds to shed some of their wisdom on these very topics with us -- all united by a common passion for knowledge sharing in its various applications and definitions. Trust me, you don't want to miss this.</span><span style="font-size: small">Â <br />

<p><span style="font-size: small">Due to the initial response and interest, we have extended this beyond the traditional shorter "salon" format, instead bumping this to a day-long affair, hosted by Science Commons with the generous support of Microsoft Research. It will be held at the <strong>Microsoft campus in Redmond WashingtonÂ from 9:30am to 5:30pm on Saturday February 20th</strong>. Stay tuned for more information on the agenda on<a href="http://sciencecommons.org/events/salon" target="_blank"> Science Commons' Events page</a>.
