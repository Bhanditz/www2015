<p>Be sure to check out <a href="http://ryanishungry.com/2007/06/25/girl-talk-illegal-art-at-its-finest/">this recent interview</a> w/ Gregg Gillis, aka <a href="http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic">Girl Talk,</a> over on <a href="http://ryanishungry.com/2007/06/25/girl-talk-illegal-art-at-its-finest/">Ryan is Hungry</a>. In the interview, Gregg goes into detail about creating his art, how it intersects and interacts with current copyright law, remixing, and specifically how efforts like Creative Commons can help artists in a positive way. It is a great interview and is a must-see for anyone interested in how remixing, new technology, and the internet are changing our very understanding of content creation and consumption.</p>
<p>We've <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7277">mentioned Girl Talk</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6095">plenty of times before</a> (we're big fans), and if you haven't had a chance yet, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Ripper-Girl-Talk/dp/B000F9RLXA">go grab a copy of his latest album</a> <em>Night Ripper</em> ASAP.</p>
