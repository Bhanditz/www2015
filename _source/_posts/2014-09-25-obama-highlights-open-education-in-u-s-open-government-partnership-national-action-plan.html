<p>YesterdayÂ at the United Nations, <a title="Celebrating Open Government Around the Globe" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/24/celebrating-open-government-around-globe">President Barack Obama marked</a> the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership</a>'s (OGP) third anniversary by announcing that in addition to the commitments outlined in the current U.S. OGP National Action Plan, "The United States will take additional steps to make our government more open, transparent, and accessible for all Americans."</p>
<p>Among the multiple new commitments: "<strong>Promote open educational resources, to help teachers and students everywhere</strong>."</p>
<p>The multi-pronged commitment to promote OER is described as the first item in the updated <a title="US OGP Plan: Announcing New Open Government Initiatives" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/new_nap_commitments_report_092314.pdf">National Action Plan Commitments document</a> (638 KB PDF):</p>

<p><strong>Promote Open Education to Increase Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open education is the open sharing of digital learning materials, tools, and practices that ensures free access to and legal adoption of learning resources. There is a growing body of evidence that the use of open education resources improves the quality of teaching and learning, including by accelerating student comprehension and by fostering more opportunities for affordable cross-border and cross-cultural educational experiences. The United States is committed to open education and will:
<ul>
<li>Raise open education awareness and identify new partnerships. The U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Education, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will jointly host a workshop on challenges and opportunities in open education internationally with stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. The session will foster collaboration among OGP members and other interested governments and will produce best practices to inform good policies in open education.</li>
<li>Pilot new models for using open educational resources to support learning. The State Department will conduct three pilots overseas by December 2015 that use open educational resources to support learning in formal and informal learning contexts. The pilotsâ€™ results, including best practices, will be made publicly available for interested educators.</li>
<li>Launch an online skills academy. The Department of Labor (DOL), with cooperation from the Department of Education, will award $25 million through competitive grants to launch an online skills academy in 2015 that will offer open online courses of study, using technology to create high-quality, free, or low-cost pathways to degrees, certificates, and other employer-recognized credentials. This academy will help students prepare for in-demand careers. Courses will be free for all to access on an open learning platform, although limited costs may be incurred for students seeking college credit that can be counted toward a degree. Leveraging emerging public and private models, the investments will help students earn credentials online through participating accredited institutions, and expand the open access to curriculum designed to speed the time to credit and completion. The online skills academy will also leverage the burgeoning marketplace of free and open-licensed learning resources, including content developed through DOLâ€™s community college grant program, to ensure that workers can get the education and training they need to advance their careers, particularly in key areas of the economy.</li>

<p>Creative Commons licenses put the "open" in OER and we stand ready to work with governments everywhere who wish to update their OGP National Action Plans with commitments to support Open Educational Resources, Open Access, Open Data and Open Policies that require publicly funded resources be openly licensed.</p>
<div>Well done, President Obama!</div>
