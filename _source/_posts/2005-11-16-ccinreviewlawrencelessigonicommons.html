<p>Two weeks ago, I described our first efforts to build CC<br />
internationally. That was the beginning of the "iCommons Project."<br />
Directed from Berlin, this project began with a single objective: to<br />
"port" Creative Commons licenses into the law of local jurisdictions.<br />
Our aim was to build an infrastructure of free licenses<br />
internationally so that creative work could move from jurisdiction to<br />
jurisdiction while preserving the freedoms that the creator chose. In<br />
less than three years, we have over 70 volunteer projects working to<br />
port Creative Commons licenses and 25 jurisdictions that have already<br />
launched their local licenses.</p>
<p>This first effort to build an international Commons has been much<br />
more successful than I ever imagined. There were many sleepless<br />
nights when I worried whether we would find any international<br />
partners  Let's just say the sleeplessness has now moved far from<br />
that concern. Indeed, if anything, we've seen the iCommons project<br />
become much more than we imagined.  As CC projects developed around<br />
the world, they connected with movements  that had the same ideals.<br />
These ideals of a "Commons" are not American. They are human. And as<br />
iCommons opened channels of discussions of these ideals, we began to<br />
recognize that the iCommons Project would have to grow.</p>
<p>Last June, around a hundred of our volunteers from more than 40 of<br />
our iCommons jurisdictions gathered in Boston for the first iCommons<br />
Summit. We began a discussion then about how we could best support<br />
this growing international movement. And as I listened to the<br />
iCommons participants describe the work that they wanted to do, I<br />
realized then that iCommons promised to become much more than the<br />
(relatively) simple project that Creative Commons was. Creative<br />
Commons was launched to build an infrastructure of freedom; iCommons<br />
promised to build a global movement that would embrace and extend (in<br />
the best possible way) that infrastructure of freedom.</p>
<p>So in June, we began to discuss publicly an idea that had been<br />
suggested by one iCommons participant â€” that we separate iCommons<br />
into its own organization, led by the many young leaders of this<br />
movement from around the world. And with this email, I am very happy<br />
to announce that we have done just that.</p>
<p>iCommons is now a separate nonprofit, organized under the laws of<br />
Britain. Its board will comprise a wide range of activists from<br />
around the world. And while iCommons will continue to support the<br />
spread of Creative Commons licenses, it will also do much more.<br />
iCommons will become the core of a federation of movements all<br />
pushing to enable creativity and the spread of knowledge and culture<br />
internationally.</p>
<p>Creative Commons will seed this movement with financial and<br />
organizational support (yet another reason we need your support!).<br />
But as iCommons becomes its own movement with its own voice, the role<br />
of Creative Commons in this federation will be just one of many.</p>
<p>What happens then to the project designed to port Creative Commons<br />
licenses internationally? That work will remain with Creative<br />
Commons. Christiane Asschenfeldt will continue to lead that part of<br />
our project. But its work will be focused upon building the legal<br />
infrastructure that Creative Commons needs internationally.<br />
Christiane will continue to identify international volunteers to help<br />
port our licenses in their local jurisdictions. We will continue to<br />
celebrate as these licenses are locally launched.  And some (we hope<br />
all) of these local partners of Creative Commons will join iCommons.</p>
<p>So "what more than licenses" is Creative Commons? We're building an<br />
infrastructure of free licenses internationally. We're working with<br />
scientists and scholars to extend these ideals to science. And now<br />
we've helped seed an international movement that will work with<br />
artists, educators, collecting rights societies, museums, publishers<br />
and governments, to build upon this infrastructure free cultures.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is all this that these emails have described. More<br />
importantly, it is all this that needs your support.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks, I'll describe two other new initiatives that<br />
will define our work over the next year. And then this path of<br />
missives will turn to consider some criticisms of what we've done and<br />
where we're going. Stay tuned, but fear not: I promise to be finished<br />
by Christmas!</p>

<p>Before I end this week's email, some news from the fundraising-front:<br />
On November 3 in San Francisco, over 120 supporters and friends of<br />
Creative Commons attended a cocktail event to celebrate new iCommons<br />
board member Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia.  The event was sponsored by<br />
the law firms that first launched Creative Commons, Cooley Godward,<br />
and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, as well as a new supporter of<br />
CC â€“ Scharffen Berger Chocolate.  Thanks to everyone who helped make<br />
that event a success. And after you view some of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49051714@N00/sets/1383014/">photos from the<br />
event</a>, please feel free to join them in supporting CC today!</p>
