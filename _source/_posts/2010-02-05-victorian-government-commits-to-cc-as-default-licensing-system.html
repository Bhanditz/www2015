<p>The UK government recently made a splash with its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20228">move towards opening government data</a>. Now CC Australia's Jessica Coates <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/279">shares</a> a promising government initiative in her home country. <strong>The Victorian Government has become the first Australian government to commit to using Creative Commons as the default licensing system for its public sector information (PSI)</strong>. Many of its reports and other works will use CC BY, which she explains is becoming the preferred license for Australian PSI.</p>
<blockquote><p>The commitment is part of the Government's <a href="http://www.diird.vic.gov.au/diird-projects/access-to-public-sector-information">response</a> to its Economic Development and Infrastructure Committeeâ€™s <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/250">Inquiry into Improving Access to Victorian Public Sector Information and Data</a>, which recommended that the Victorian Government adopt a â€œhybrid public sector information licensing model comprising Creative Commons and a tailored suite of licences for restricted materials.â€</p>
<p>Specifically, the response (which is under CC BY-NC-ND) states at p.8  that:</p>
<p>he Victorian Government endorses the committeeâ€™s overarching recommendation that the default position for the management of PSI  should be open access. The Victorian Government further commits to the development  of a whole-of-government Information Management Framework (IMF) whereby PSI  is made available under Creative Commons licensing by default with a tailored  suite of licences for restricted materials.</p>
<p>As far as we are aware, this is the strongest commitment to Creative  Commons implementation made by any Australian government. While there have been a number of excellent CC-friendly recommendations coming out of recent  government inquiries - notably the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/277" target="_blank">Government 2.0</a> and <a href="http://www.innovation.gov.au/innovationreview/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Venturous Australia</a> reports - these are yet to be officially adopted. And  while there are some excellent implementation projects - the Victorian Government specifically mentions the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/207" target="_blank">Australian Bureau  of Statistics</a> and Queenslandâ€™s <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/229" target="_blank">Government  Information Licensing Framework</a> - these are still limited to individual  agencies.</p>
<p>We'll be very excited to see where the Victorian goes from here.</p></blockquote>
