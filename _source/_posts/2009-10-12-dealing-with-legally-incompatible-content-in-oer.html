<p>Last month, ccLearn published "<a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Otherwise_Open_report.pdf">Otherwise Open: Managing Incompatible Content in OER</a>". For those of you who never got around to reading the paper, it basically provides an overview of the problem posed by the incorporation of "all-rights-reserved" materials into otherwise open educational resources (OER). It also explores ways of dealing with this problem and the trade-offs involved in relying on jurisdictional copyright exceptions and limitations, such as fair use or fair dealing. As the paper is intended to spur further inquiry and research globally, "<a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Otherwise_Open_report.pdf">Otherwise Open</a>" does not offer concrete solutions to the problem <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>However, the average OER creator cannot afford to wait, especially if they value their work as part of a global learning commons. In order for OER to be global, the copyright of the OER must be viable across jurisdictions. OER that are available under a CC license are global, as CC licenses are effective worldwide. But the inclusion of third party content that is not under the same terms of the license changes the global nature of OER, potentially walling it off from use in other countries. Thus, ccLearn has developed some practical recommendations and alternatives for those OER creators who are concerned with the global reach and impact of their works.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Open Educational Resources (OER) are defined by the use of a Creative Commons license and are generally created by those who would like to share their work globally. However, some creators find the need to consider the costs and benefits of incorporating third-party materials with incompatible licenses into their â€œotherwise openâ€ OER. This document recommends ways of managing or avoiding the problems that will arise."</p></blockquote>
