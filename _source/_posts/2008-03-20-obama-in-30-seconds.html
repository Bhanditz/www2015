<p><a href="http://moveon.org/">Moveon.org </a>recently launched a contest called <a href="http://www.obamain30seconds.org/">"Obama in 30 Seconds,"</a> which encourages the public to create political ads in support of Barack Obama. All works must be released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">BY-NC-SA license</a> and the wining ad, which will be voted on by both the public and a panel of judges including <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#0">CC Founder and CEO Lawrence Lessig</a>, will be aired nationally. The winner will also receive a gift certificate for $20,000 in video equipment.</p>
<p>Entries can be submitted from March 27th to April 1st, and winners will be announced on April 17th. There is a fairly in-depth <a href="http://www.obamain30seconds.org/faq.html">F.A.Q page</a> with all the necessary details, so if you have an interest in Obama, CC-licensed video contests, or new HD cameras, be sure to check it all out!<a href="http://www.obamain30seconds.org/"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>MoveOn.org has a message for all filmmakers, writers, directors, actors, editors, composers, graphic artists, and animators: Whether you're a total amateur or a total pro, now is the time to use your creativity to help Barack Obama win. We're launching an ad contest: "Obama in 30 Seconds."</p>
<p>Powered by grassroots enthusiasm, Obama has won the most states and the most delegates. But the race isn't over, and we've got to pull out all the stops to help him across the finish line.</p>
<p>We're counting on you to make amazing ads in the next three weeks. Then, MoveOn members and the public will rate the ads, and a panel of top artists, netroots heroes, and filmmaking professionals will pick the winner from among top ads. We'll air the winning ad nationally, and the winner will receive a gift certificate for $20,000 in video equipment.</p></blockquote>
