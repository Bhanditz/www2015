<p>Exciting news from <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">Indaba Music</a> - alternative rock band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Eye_Blind">Third Eye Blind</a> have teamed up with the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8099">former Featured Commoner</a> to offer fans of the band, and Indaba members, increased interaction with the band's music and writing process. 3EB will posting unfinished song stems to the community site, allowing members to take the stems, reuse/remix them, and post them as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> licensed reworkings (somewhat similar to our <a href="http://ccmixter.org/copyrightcriminals/view/contest/about">Copyright Criminals</a> contest).</p>
<p>To be clear the 3EB tracks are not CC-licensed, but CC licenses will allow Indaba members the ability to spread their creations in a non-commercial setting and experiment with 3EB's material before it is released. Similarly, 3EB gains a means to collaborate with their fans in a way that is unique and more personal. The best material resulting from this collaboration will go on a companion album to be released alongside the bandâ€™s album sometime next year. From Indaba:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Here's the deal. As 3EB finishes laying down tracks, the band will post unmixed instrument stems for you to tweak, shape, and edit through a series of contests. They want to hear your vision for their songs. The first track, "Non-Dairy Creamer," is already available for you to work on!</p>
<p>Through a regular blog that chronicles their experience of creating an album, access to the unmixed stems and the dialogue among Indaba members, you'll have the chance to watch the group develop their artistic concept. </p></blockquote>
