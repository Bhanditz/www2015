<p>From November 12th through 19th, Creative Commons will host a week-long online discussion entitled "Copyleft, Right & Center: Innovations in Law," cosponsored by <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/distributedcreativity">Eyebeam</a> and the University of Maine.  We'd like to invite you, members of the Creative Commons community, to participate in the discussion by <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-eyebeam">joining the list</a>.  The resulting dialogue will be edited and published in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0820470538/qid=1068512165/sr=1-12/ref=sr_1_12/103-4945252-3527056?v=glance&s=books">book</a> and the archived discussion will be licensed under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike</a> license. The inaugural message will be sent on November 12th from Eyebeam, to be followed-up with a message from Creative Commons.  If you wish just to follow the discussion, you'll be able to read the archives <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/distributedcreativity">here</a>.</p>
