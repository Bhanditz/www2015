<p><a href="http://capl.washjeff.edu/">CAPL</a>, the Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon originally founded at Washington and Jefferson College in 2003, re-launches today. From the announcement email:</p>
<blockquote><p>"CAPL is a free, online, non-commercial visual glossary comprised of authentic photos for language and cultural instruction and research. Created at Washington & Jefferson College, CAPL seeks to provide teachers and learners with high-quality authentic images for their classrooms and teaching materials. Additionally, it provides researchers in applied linguistics, visual cognition, and automated image recognition with a database of high-quality culturally authentic images they can use in their research. At the core of CAPL is the generous creative commons license."</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://capl.washjeff.edu/">CAPL</a> is based on the premise that "visual perception is culturally determined and visual cognition varies from culture to culture." It asks the question, "Is a house really a Haus, is pain really Ñ…Ð»ÐµÐ±, and when we see red cabbage, is it really red?" To find out, go check out CAPL for yourself!</p>
