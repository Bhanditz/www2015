<p>We have a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/video/mod-films">new Featured Commoner</a> â€” an interview with <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/ourawardees/profiles/4397/index.html">Michela Ledwidge</a> of <a href="http://modfilms.com/">MODfilms</a> by one of our Summer '06 interns, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#59">Amy Rose.</a>  MODfilms produces "remixable" film content and technology aimed at new cinema platforms and is currently working on a film called <a href="http://modfilms.com/archives/20040903_sanctuary.html">"Sanctuary,"</a> which will be released to the public under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a> to enable remixes.  As you can read in the interview, the concept of a remixable film caused at least one actors' union considerable consternation.  MODfilms' experience provides an instructive insight into the challenges remix culture poses to, and faces in the light of, established industry arrangements.</p>
