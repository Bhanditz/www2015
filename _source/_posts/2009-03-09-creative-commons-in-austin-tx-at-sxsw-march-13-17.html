<p><a href="http://sxsw.com/">South by Southwest</a> (SXSW) is right around the corner, and a few members of the Creative Commons staff (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#64">Melissa</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#110">Lila</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#98">Fred</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#50">me</a>) will be in attendance for the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/">Interactive</a> portion of the festival (March 13-17). We'll be on hand to talk about CC's work and projects, and we'd love to meet you. Here's a short guide to some of the places you'll be able to find us while we're in Austin.</p>
<p><strong>Trade Show:</strong> We'll be working a booth at the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/trade_show">SXSW Trade Show</a> (Level 4, Grand Ballroom of the <a href="http://www.austinconventioncenter.com/">Austin Convention Center</a> - <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/mm?hl=en&ie=UTF8&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&dq=Austin+Convention+Center&daddr=500+E+Cesar+Chavez+St,+Austin,+TX+78701&geocode=11803549798128476887,30.262204,-97.739666&ei=3-K1SfzsAZGUsAO7l7zlCA&ll=30.262204,-97.739666&spn=0.009656,0.018239&z=16">500 E Cesar Chavez St.</a>, Austin, TX 78701), which is open on Saturday, March 14 (Noon to 6pm), Sunday, March 15 (Noon to 6pm), and Monday, March 16 (Noon to 4pm). The four of us will be working in shifts, and there will always be someone around to talk to. We'll have our usual flyers, stickers, and pins; we'll also be offering CC t-shirts and a stock of brand new, limited edition flash drives (similar to the ones we offered as part of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10668">2008 fundraising drive collaboration with Jonathan Coulton</a> - but these are purple!) in exchange for contributions to Creative Commons. We'll also have a laptop stocked with a curated collection of CC-licensed media, including music from WFMU's <a href="http://www.freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a> and videos from the recently-announced <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13145">Uncensored Interview</a> project.</p>
<p><strong>Talks:</strong> I'll be participating in a panel discussion called <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule/?action=show&id=IAP0900053">"How to Protect Your Brand Without Being a Jerk!"</a> on Monday, March 16th, 11:30am - 12:30pm, in Room 10 of the Austin Convention Center. Fred will be giving a talk entitled <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&id=IAP0900325">"DRM: The Fight Isn't Over Yet"</a> on Tuesday, March 17th, 5:00pm - 6:00pm, in Room Hilton D of the Austin Convention Center.</p>
<p><strong>Party:</strong> We'll be representing CC at <a href="http://plutopia.org/">Plutopia</a> on Monday, March 16, 6pm - midnight at the <a href="http://www.palmereventscenter.com/">Palmer Events Center</a> (<a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=900+Barton+Springs+Rd+Austin+TX&ie=UTF8&om=1&ll=30.263237,-97.747099&spn=0.008155,0.01914&z=16&iwloc=addr">900 Barton Springs Rd.</a>, Austin, TX 78704). Plutopia (previously discussed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13133">here</a>) is a music, art, and performance party that we've attended for the last few years. It's a great place to meet people interested in technology and art. Admission to the event is free for conference badge holders and $10 for the general public.</p>
<p>We hope to see you in Austin!</p>
