<p>This past September, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/"><em>Wired</em></a> hosted a sold-out concert in New York with all proceeds donated to Creative Commons. The show celebrated creative reuse and featured mash-up/remix artist <a href="http://www.girl-talk.net/">Girl Talk</a>, DJ/producer <a href="http://formdiplo.com">Diplo</a>, and experimental pop supergroup <a href="http://www.ipecac.com/bio.php?id=44">Peeping Tom</a>. The incredibly talented people at <a href="http://www.missingpieces.tv/">Missing Pieces</a> created a mini-documentary about the event, which also includes portions of speeches delivered that night by CC's <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> and <em>Wired</em>'s <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/">Chris Anderson</a>. The video is an awesome piece of work that does an amazing job communicating the power of remix culture. We've posted the clip to our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learnmore">Learn More</a> page; you can also watch it by clicking <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/movingimages/wired_nextmusic.mov">this direct link</a>.</p>
