<p>Vimeo has <a href="http://vimeo.com/blog:473">revamped</a> their platform for video creators and users, including the creation of a Creative Commons landing page where you can browse and search for videos by CC license!</p>
<p><img src="img/vimeo_cc_landing_page.jpg" alt="" title="vimeo_cc_landing_page" width="500" height="536" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31416" /></p>
<p>From <a href="http://vimeo.com/new">http://vimeo.com/new</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Our members love using Creative Commons licenses to rework, remix, and reimagine, which is why we built a whole new section to help you discover videos available with Creative Commons licenses. Browse and search millions of videos categorized by license type and learn about what you can (and can't) do with other peopleâ€™s videos on Vimeo."</p></blockquote>
<p>We were thrilled when Vimeo <a href="http://vimeo.com/blog:321">enabled the CC license suite</a> in July of 2010; we are even more thrilled that the Vimeo team has since recognized the community's needs to easily discover high quality CC-licensed videos. Blake Whitman, Vimeo's VP of Creative Development, says,</p>
<blockquote><p>"We know the many ways in which sharing can positively impact creativity. As such, we will continue to build features that enable people to exchange ideas, and that support the Vimeo community's growing demand for creative sharing. <strong>Our partnership with Creative Commons is the backbone of this commitment.</strong>"</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only will this development help video creators and users everywhere, it will also help to improve our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics">metrics</a> on CC-licensed works on the web and assess their impact, so we can better help CC creators and users everywhere.</p>
<p>Three cheers to Vimeo!
