<p>We're happy to announce <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/movingimagecontest">the winners</a> in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contest/">GET CREATIVE!: Moving Images Contest</a>. Last fall, we asked aspiring filmmakers and flash artists to create a short film that explained the mission of the Creative Commons. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contest/judges">Our panel of judges</a> has selected <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/movingimagecontest">the top three entries</a> and they're all terrific. We want to thank everyone that entered, everyone that helped spread the word, our judges for taking time to help us with the contest, and most of all thanks and congratulations to Justin Cone, Sheryl Seibert, and Kuba & Alek Tarkowski.</p>
