<h3><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/19494">Open Education: The Business & Policy Case for OER</a></p>
<p>The Internet, increasingly affordable computing, open licensing, open access journals and open educational resources provide the foundation for a world in which a quality education can be a basic human right. Yet before we break the "iron triangle" of access, cost and quality with new models, we need to develop sustainable open business models with open policies: public access to publicly funded resources.</p>

<h3><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/22367">How Open Licensing Is Transforming Design</a></p>
<p>When designers share their work under an open license, they invite others to build upon and transform their designs without asking for permission, sometimes even using them commercially. A few years ago, the idea of letting non-clients steal your work was crazy; today, itâ€™s a big part of how designers network, collaborate, and create professional opportunities for themselves and each other.</p>

<h3><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/23974">How Creative Commons Is Changing Artists' Careers</a></p>
<p>When creators share their art under a Creative Commons license, they invite others to build upon and transform their work without asking for permission. Everyone has heard the stories of big names like Amanda Palmer and Cory Doctorow licensing their work under CC, but what about artists who donâ€™t already have a massive following? Does open licensing open doors for developing creators, or does it close off potential revenue streams?</p>
