<p>The folks over at <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, who are also some of the brains behind the <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress blogging system</a>, have developed <a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/">Widgets for Wordpress</a>.  Widgets are a way for users to easily customize their blog's look and feel without dropping into HTML or PHP.  WpLicense 0.7.0 has been released, and includes support for rendering your selected license as a widget.  Full details, along with download links, are <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/WpLicense">in the wiki</a>, naturally.</p>
<p>Now if only <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> would support WpLicense for their hosted blogs, even more happy WordPress users could be happy contributors to the Commons.</p>
