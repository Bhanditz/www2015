<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board#michaelcarroll">Mike Carroll</a> was a practicing lawyer in Washington DC when the idea of openly licensed copyright landed on his desk as a pro bono project. "It was going to be a central repository of content, where we had the copyright and would openly license it to others," he says. After a group brainstorm led by Larry Lessig at the Harvard Berkman Center in May 2001, the lawyers decided to scrap the central repository idea and create licenses that others could use freely. Shortly after that, Carroll was invited to join the board of the organization that would soon become known as Creative Commons.</p>
<p>CC quickly evolved from an idea that artists were skeptical aboutâ€”why would any creative person be willing to give up control?â€”to something that proliferated across state borders and disciplines.</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #1f50a9} -->"The Internet is global, and we knew we would have to grapple with theÂ complexities of international copyright and that we would add science toÂ the mix," he says. "But the pressure to do that came much faster than weÂ expected. In short order, we had to organize a pretty sophisticatedÂ operation on a limited budget to engage with the international networkÂ of support for the Creative Commons idea."</p>
<p>Still, Carroll says, there are challenges ahead. "We are offering tools as a solution to a problem that not everyone knows they have."Â For one thing, awareness about what open content is, and why making it legally openÂ matters, is still a bit hazy for some. The good news is that some webÂ sites have seamlessly integrated CC into their functions, like theÂ <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> search engine. The challenge is to engage with the continuingÂ evolution of the web to make sure adopting CC is easy and natural.</p>
<p>"We care deeply about not getting locked into things that can't evolve as the web evolves. If it were easier to find reliable CC content, that makes using CC licenses more attractive. We're trying to keep the web open in an interoperable spaceâ€”but it's not just the technology. It's the values embedded in our technical choices."</p>
<p>Those valuesâ€”openness, flexibility, sharingâ€”are a part of Carroll's life both professionally and personally. Carroll is now the Director of the <a href="http://www.wcl.american.edu/pijip/">Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property</a> at American University.Â In conjunction with Creative Commons, he has worked for yearsÂ with the library community to promote open access to the scholarly andÂ scientific journal literature on web. Â He also serves on the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/brdi/index.htm">NationalÂ Research Council's Board on Research Data and Information</a> to addressÂ issues such as data sharing among scientists, and he's a Fellow at theÂ Center for Democracy and Technology.</p>
<p>He's also a hobby musician who sometimes gets together with other copyright lawyers to jam. "I'm one of those musicians [that loves] to play to the crowd," he says, in the same spirit of an organization dedicated to helping other creators share.</p>
