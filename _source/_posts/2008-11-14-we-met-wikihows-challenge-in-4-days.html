<p>I'm thrilled to announce that we have far exceeded <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10557">wikiHow's matching challenge goal</a> of raising $3000 in two weeks. We raised $3000 in 4 days! Thanks to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">wikiHow</a> for their ongoing support (they've been CC supporters for 4 years running) and to our community members for helping us meet wikiHow's challenge!</p>
<p>The campaign will end at midnight (PST) on December 31st, and it's extremely important that we reach our goal by then. <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">Please help us reach our $500,000 goal</a>. If you work for a company that shares the same ideals - let them know they can run their own matching challenge. If interested please contact me at development@creativecommons.org. </p>
