<p><a href="http://cc-gems.blogspot.com/">The Best Media in Life is Free</a> is a newish blog recommending quality CC licensed music and public domain books. An <a href="http://cc-gems.blogspot.com/2006/07/media-one-of-each.html">early post compliments other CC tastemakers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://cchits.ning.com/artists/?/shannon_campbell/your_own_dot_org/">Shannon Campbell, Your Own Dot Org</a>: A cute little pop-ish thing that is one of the few cc-licensed songs I have that has not turned up yet on CC 365 or one of my other regular spots. I found this one all by my own self :)</p></blockquote>

<p>It doesn't take a dedicated blog or podcast to further the discovery process. [Re]blog and tell your friends about CC licensed media you love. Even if you only do it once it is a big help.</p>
