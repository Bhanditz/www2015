<p>We've recently flipped the switch on German Creative Commons licenses. Like the recent Brazil, Finland, and Japan licenses, in addition to the rewritten legal code that is now based on German law, the license interface is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=de">now available in German</a>, as well as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/de/deed.de">the licenses themselves</a>. </p>
<p>Thanks goes out to the folks at both <a href="http://www.z-a-r.de">The Insitute for Information Law at the University of Karlsruhe</a> and <a href="http://www.ifross.de">Institut f&#252;r Rechtsfragen der Freien und Open Source Software<br />
(ifrOSS)</a> for all their help along the way. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/4249">This press release</a> has more details about the launch.</p>
