<p><a href="http://p2p-politics.org">A new site called P2P Politics</a> is now live. The site enables anyone to select from a menu of video clips the ones that best express their view of the U.S. presidential elections, and then email links to those clips, along with a personalized message, to friends, family, and colleagues. It is like a cross between an online greeting-card service and a gallery of campaign advertisements, and all content is Creative Commons licensed and hosted at the Internet Archive. <a href="http://p2p-politics.org/about">Learn more</a>. (Like Creative Commons, the site is nonpartisan and seeking content from across the ideological spectrum; it looks as though their seed content is heavy on the incumbent, but they seem to be actively pursuing other viewpoints right off the bat.)</p>
