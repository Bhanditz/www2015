<p>Back in October, CNET Executive Editor Tom Merrit wrote a <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3000_7-6357305-1.html">piece</a> about Creative Commons considering the question "Does Creative Commons free your content?" Creative Commons' <a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/">international partners</a> wanted to share the article with their colleagues and fellow countrymen - but the drawback was that it was only available in English. Luckily, Tom was able to persuade the CNET legal department to license the text of the article under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license</a>. Now the article is available in <a href="http://creativecommons.jp/learn/merritt.html">Japanese</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.il/blog/?p=19">Hebrew</a>, <a href="http://www.liberacultura.it/index.php?p=45">Italian</a> and <a href="http://www.creativecommons.cl/?p=27">Spanish</a>...with possible more translations in the works. A great example of Creative Commons licenses enabling dialogue across geographic and linguistic boundaries.</p>
