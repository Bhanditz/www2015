<p>Public discussion of adaptation of Creative Commons licenses to Malta to start in November 2005</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, USA and Berlin, GERMANY â€” November 28, 2005 â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon, announced today that Malta is the latest country to join its global licensing project.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses, which are available free of charge from the groupâ€™s <a href="http://creativecommons.org">website</a>, allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>In an effort spearheaded by Project Leads Daniele Cop and Brian Restall of Project in Motion (PiM) Creative Commons Malta plans to adapt the copyright licenses for use under Maltese law and to build local engagement with and use of Creative Commons-licensed content.</p>
<p>This November, Creative Commons Malta will post their initial drafts on the Creative Commons website for public discussionâ€”participation in which is open to all.</p>
<p>About Project in Motion Ltd (PiM).</p>
<p>Projects in Motion Ltd (PiM) was set up to provide the leadership and expertise required to boost Maltaâ€™s participation in a range of European programmes and initiatives. It addresses the need expressed by local SMEs for more specific information and assistance in promoting international cooperation and networking, and in offering services related to ICTs, management, research, training and dissemination activities.</p>
<p>PiM's network of experts covers areas like ICT, education, health, law, as well as cultural, scientific, environmental, agricultural and socio-economic disciplines. Through its association with other organizations, PiM strives to overcome the existing high fragmentation of resources. It brings together local players to create knowledge-intensive, multi-stakeholder partnerships possessing the critical mass needed to achieve excellence. PiM therefore aims to facilitate the transformation of local SMEs into learning organisations set to reap the benefits of the knowledge economy.</p>
