<p>2013 starts off fresh with Dan Mills joining the Creative Commons team as our director of product strategy. We are delighted to have Dan onboard and look forward to engaging his leadership. In his new role, Dan will head the Technology Team in the creation of software products to propel the Creative Commons mission forward and enable the growth of the community.</p>
<p>Dan brings a spot on range of skills and experience to his new position. Before Creative Commons, Dan was Product Manager for <a href="http://identity.mozilla.com/">Identity at Mozilla</a>, responsible for creating <a href="http://persona.org/">Persona</a>, a decentralized Web sign-in solution. He has worked with partners to integrate sign-in and payments into the Firefox Marketplace and upcoming <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/">Firefox OS</a>. Dan has served as a spokesperson for Mozilla in many international venues, including Barcelona, Buenos Aires, and Kuala Lumpur. He led efforts to engage and grow the open source communities for Mozilla in various countries.</p>
<p>Prior to switching over to product management, Dan was a software engineer at <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/en-US/">Mozilla Labs</a> and the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> team, as well as the open source startup Ximian (acquired by Novell).</p>
<p>Dan grew up in sunny Venezuela. He has lived in the US since going to Duke University, where he graduated with a BS in computer science and minors in economics and Italian. He loves to cook and experiment with his sous vide machine. We look forward to Dan sharing his culinary delights and product vision with all of us at CC!</p>
