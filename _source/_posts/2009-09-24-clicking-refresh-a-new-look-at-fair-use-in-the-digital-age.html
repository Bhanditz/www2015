<p>For those of you in the NY area in October, the New York City Bar has a thought provoking panel discussion coming up on fair use in the era of blogging, Twitter, and Facebook. The panel members hail from the U.S. District Court, the Associated Press, and Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, to name a few. And in the spirit of this topic, I'm going to quote from the <a href="http://www.nycbar.org/EventsCalendar/show_event.php?eventid=1217">site</a> now,</p>
<blockquote><p>"This panel discussion will address the ways in which copyright lawâ€™s fair use doctrine has evolved (or may be tested) in an era in which the rise of news aggregation, social networking, and a variety of other websites increasingly allow internet users to combine and transform content from endless sources of media. How transformative are on-line montages and mash-ups? Is the aggregation of headlines or content from news providers infringement or fair use? Does posting copyrighted content on a userâ€™s Facebook or Myspace page undermine the market for that content? When does a bloggerâ€™s summary of an article appropriate enough content to constitute copyright infringement? Panelists will offer a broad range of perspectives on these an other issues from the bench, bar, media industry, and legal academy."</p></blockquote>
<p>The discussion will be held on Wednesday, October 7 at 6pm, so be sure to <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/EventsCalendar/register/?event=1217&price=896">register</a> (for free) and drop by.</p>
