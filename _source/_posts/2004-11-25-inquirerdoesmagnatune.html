<p>Snarky tech news site the INQUIRER <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=19868">interviews Magnatune's John Buckman</a>, who is refreshingly direct.</p>
<blockquote><p>Buckman: We sell a little over 1000 albums a month - about $10,000 a month - and this has been stable for about 6 months. Music Licensing has grown from about $2,000 a month 6 months ago to about $10,000 a month now. I expect most future growth to come through sales through other channels, as well as music licensing.</p></blockquote>
