<p>Evan Prodromou just published a great essay on <a href="http://evan.prodromou.name/Paying_wiki_contributors">paying wiki contributors</a>. He says don't, offering solid reasons and alternatives.  One alternative that I won't argue with (but probably one of the least interesting--read the essay for more):<br />
<blockquote><strong>Donate</strong>. Set aside a good part of the profits from the site (if there are any...) to donations to related charities. Donations to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a> are probably all good candidates. There may also be domain-specific charities you can contribute to; if you have a site about pets, say, you could contribute to the <a href="http://www.animalrescuenetwork.org/">Animal Rescue Network</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Relatedly, Evan's talk at SXSW this spring on <a href="http://evan.prodromou.name/Talks/SXSW07">Commercialization of Wikis</a> was the best session at SXSW (says me) and a must read for anyone building a community or user generated content site (Evan argues that many such sites have "WikiNature" though they aren't formally wikis).</p>
<p>To wrap up the self-serving nature of this post, Evan recommends CC licensing for commercial wikis. But that should be obvious.</p>
