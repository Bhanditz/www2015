<p><a href="http://www.legaltorrents.com/">LegalTorrents</a> is a new site offering 5Gb of electronic music from a variety of labels, all licensed under Creative Commons. What makes this site unique is the large downloads are shared among everyone downloading, thanks to the P2P technology of <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/introduction.html">BitTorrent</a>. Once you <a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html">download a client</a> and load up a music torrent file, you'll be downloading the file from everyone that has downloaded the file, and as you gather data others will be downloading from you. It's an incredible technology meant to share large file downloads like these music archives and things such as linux distributions. The technology also has a checkered past due to its use for sharing illegal files, hence the name of the site, <a href="http://www.legaltorrents.com/">LegalTorrents</a>.</p>
