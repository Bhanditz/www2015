<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> is represented this week as part of the first ever Open Source Pavilion at the world's largest Graphic Conference, Siggraph. The booth this year is set-up by Ton Rosendaal, the project lead of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">CC-BY 2.5 licensed</a> <a href="http://elephantsdream.org/">Elephant's Dream Open Source movie</a>.</p>
<p>Please stop by booth #1527 all week to discuss Creative Commons, licensing, and how you can plug into the <a href="http://developer.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons Developer Community</a>. Also, <a href="http://akseezanimation.com/2006/06/free-siggraph-2006-passes.html">click here</a> to get a free pass to get into the exhibition. It will save you some cash.</p>
<p>This conference participation comes on the heals of the previous week's successful <a href="http://desktopcon.org/">Desktop Developer Conference</a> in Ottawa, Canada, where Jon Phillips (myself) presented "May I See Your License?" which looked at the technical side of Creative Commons and similar aforementioned topics.</p>
<p>Look for Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6000">upcoming participation in Linux World</a> August 14-17 in San Francisco at the Moscone Center.</p>
