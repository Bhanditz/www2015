<p><a href="http://wordle.net/">Wordle</a> is an awesomely fun new tool (read what the <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2008/06/wordle_tedtalks.php">TEDBlog had to say</a> about it) that makes aesthetically pleasing text-images out of any block of text, a site's RSS feed, or a user's <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> bookmarks. Check out a '<a href="http://wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/45847/Creative_Commons">wordle</a>' we made of CC's <em>"Share, Remix, Reuse â€” Legally"</em> text found on the front page of our website:</p>

<p>All of the images created by Wordle are released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">BY license</a>, meaning that you can <a href="http://wordle.net/faq">reuse them as you see fit</a> as long as you provide proper attribution. Some seriously cool ideas are sure to follow - for instance <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/editors-blog/2008/06/wordle-wordclouds-simplest-bus.html">one great idea</a> (UPDATE: link fixed!) for using <a href="http://www.moo.com/">MOO</a>, Wordle, and <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> to create some eye-catching business cards.</p>
