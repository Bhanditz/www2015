<p>October 13 was the <a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/274">4th anniversary</a> of the first issue of <em>PLoS Biology</em>, the first journal from the groudbreaking <a href="http://plos.org">Public Library of Science</a>.</p>
<p>We're incredibly honored that PLoS was a <em>very</em> early adopter of Creative Commons -- we'll only <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7693">turn five</a> in two months. See then CC Executive Director Glenn Otis Brown's editorial in <em>PLoS Biology</em>'s first issue: <em><a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0000009">Out of the Way: How the next copyright revolution can launch the next scientific revolution</a></em>.</p>
<p>PLoS (and CC) have made good of these promising beginnings, but expect <strong>much</strong> greater things in the next half decade. This movement, or rather these intertwined movements, are just getting rolling.</p>
<p>On this note, pay close attention to <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.plosone.org">PLoS ONE</a>. The latter recently published its 1000th research article.  I'm particularly fond of #994, <em><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000994">Ant Species Differences Determined by Epistasis between Brood and Worker Genomes</a></em> (disclaimer: the author is my brother).</p>
