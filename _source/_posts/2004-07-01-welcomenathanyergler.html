<p>Early last October we launched a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3856">revamp</a> of the Creative Commons website, including the addition of a new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3859">technology challenges</a> section.  A few days later someone called <a href="http://yergler.net">Nathan Yergler</a> wrote with questions concerning two of the challenges.  A week later Nathan <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-metadata/2003-October/000175.html">announced</a> that <a href="http://www.yergler.net/projects/ccvalidator/">ccValidator</a> was ready for testing.</p>
<p>Since then Nathan has been our most prolific volunteer, adding <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/ccrdf">Python</a> and <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/ccrdf/javascript">JavaScript</a> language APIs for CC metadata, <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc">mozCC</a>, and <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/ccsaver">ccSaver</a> to his portfolio.  None of these have been throwaway projects.  Nathan keeps making them <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4288">better</a>.</p>
<p>The last couple months Nathan has been working on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4279">ccTag</a> for Creative Commons.  Now we're very pleased to announce that he has joined the Creative Commons staff as a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#31">software engineer</a>.  He'll continue to create more and better CC tools, as well as help us with internal and external web projects.</p>
<p>How can you welcome Nathan? Try <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc">mozCC</a>. If you can find a bug, <a href="http://mozcc.mozdev.org/bugs.html">send him a report</a>.</p>
