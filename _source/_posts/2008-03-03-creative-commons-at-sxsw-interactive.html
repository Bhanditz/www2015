<p>A few members of the Creative Commons staff are headed to Austin, Texas later this week to attend <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/">South by Southwest Interactive</a>. If you're going to be in town for it too, make sure to find us and say hello.</p>
<p>During the days of March 9, 10, and 11, we'll have a booth at the <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/tradeshow/if_exhibition/">trade show</a>, which is a good place to visit us, ask us questions about Creative Commons, and pick up CC swag.</p>
<p>On the evening of March 10, we're participating in a really cool event called <a href="http://plutopia.org/">Plutopia</a>, which is EFF-Austin's eighth annual "Interactive Tech Gathering of the Tribes."</p>
<p>And on the afternoon of March 11, I'll be moderating a panel called "New Media Powering Entertainment." The panel's <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060568">page</a> is a little out of date, but the discussion is slated to feature Robert Scoble (<a href="http://blog.fastcompany.com/archives/2008/01/16/technology_blogger_robert_scoble_to_launch_fastcompanytv.html">Fast Company TV</a>), Carlton Evans (<a href="http://www.disposablefilmfest.com/">Disposable Film Festival</a>), Tony Pham (<a href="http://www.slide.com/">Slide</a>), and Daniel <span class="nfakPe">Graf</span> (<a href="http://www.kyte.tv/">Kyte</a>).</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
