<p>The <a href="http://uc.princeton.edu/main/">University Channel</a> - a collaboration between over <a href="http://uc.princeton.edu/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=12&Itemid=12">30 universities, thinktanks and other organizations</a> that host events relevant to a range of public affairs issues - has released its webcasts, podcasts, vodcasts and blogs under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-Sharelike 2.5</a> license.  UC invites contributors to submit recordings of lectures, seminars, panels and interviews to the site so that these can be disseminated as widely as possible to the public.</p>
<p>It hopes to provide a distribution channel for these recordings that were already being made for archival purposes but not being publicly<br />
disseminated for lack of a distribution mechanism.  Utilizing CC licenses, of course, the University Channel will now better achieve its<br />
purpose by enabling wider dissemination of its materials.</p>
