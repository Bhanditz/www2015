<a href="http://www.liberatedgames.com/about.php">Liberated Games</a> is a new project that offers <a href="http://www.liberatedgames.com/gamelisting.php">downloadable versions</a> (some with source code) of commercial video games that are several years old. The creators of the games have given their permission for the free downloads and offer them under <a href="http://www.liberatedgames.com/license.php">a variety of licenses</a>.</p>
<p>
Technology moves quickly these days, making software, books, and information outdated within just a few years after release. It's great to see the creators of all these games acknowledge this and allow fans to play their old favorites freely.</p>
