<p>These 4 talented students have been working on a variety of licensing projects with the CC staff.  To show how innovative this summer has been, they will present their work in virtual space as the fourth event in our monthly Second Life series.  Be ready for discussions about new ways that CC licenses can be used in architecture and designing, sampling music, writing, and technology.  It's going off at our HQ on <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Kula%204/46/92/26/">Kula Island</a>: Thursday, July 20 at 4pm PDT.</p>
