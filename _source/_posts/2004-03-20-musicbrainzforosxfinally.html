<p><a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>, the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/news/licenses.html">Creative Commons licensed music metadata database</a>, has long been limited to windows users. OS X users are in luck though, as <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/22813">iEatBrainz</a> has been released.</p>
<p>By using a sophisticated set of audio fingerprinting and other technology, iEatBrainz and MusicBrainz allow you to re-tag all your MP3s. This is a killer feature for anyone that's ever ripped one of their CDs with iTunes, but didn't have a network connection at the time the songs were imported. Try it out, after a few moments MusicBrainz will likely find a match for all your "Track 01, Track 02, etc" tracks in iTunes. [via <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/">Ben Hammersley</a>]</p>
