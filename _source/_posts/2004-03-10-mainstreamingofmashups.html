At the tail end of last night's broadcast of ABC's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, they did <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/videofiles/Video/040309mash_video_context.html">a short piece on music mash-ups</a> (video only available to ABCnews premium subscribers).</p>
<p>
There's an interview with <a href="http://www.mitchbutler.com/">Mitch Butler</a> and he does a live mash-up demo of Eminem's Without Me laid over Scott Joplin's ragtime piano classics. ABCnews also covers the DJ Dangermouse's Grey Album controversy. Unfortunately, the piece characterizes all mash-ups as completely illegal and alludes to people using PCs and audio software as potentially doing great harm to the music industry.</p>
