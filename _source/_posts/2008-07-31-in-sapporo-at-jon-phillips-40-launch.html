<p>I'm in Sapporo for the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCi_Legal_Day_Programme_2008">CC Legal Day</a>, <a href="http://commonsresearch.wikidot.com/program">Commons Research Mini-conference</a> which the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/metrics">Metrics Project</a> is but part, and to further promote the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/casestudies">CC Case Studies project</a>. As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8504">Greg outlined so clearly last week</a> and I <a href="http://rejon.org/2008/07/27/creative-commons-case-studies-metrics-project-and-cc-integration-tools-at-isea-2008-singapore/">presented</a> at the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8521">launch of CC Singapore</a> a few days ago, this project is doing quite well with 112 submissions from around the world assisted by a great system for supporting this community project, and even better brilliant people adding case studies daily!</p>
<p>Also, you kind readers might have noticed that we have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/casestudies">launched</a> and/or refreshed <a href="/projects/liblicense">several</a> <a href="/projects/LicenseChooser.js">projects</a> over the <a href="/projects/metrics">last few weeks</a> to prepare for a coming change. As of August, my role with Creative Commons will change from managing community and business development to being liaison in ongoing similar affairs. This also means that I will be spending most of my time on projects outside of Creative Commons &mdash; most still involve using <a href="/license">Creative Commons licensing</a> and technology.</p>
<p>I'm not leaving the culture of free and open, nor Creative Commons, both of which I have been involved with for some time. Rather, I will be, as of August 2nd, devoting most of my energy to projects I've been delaying or couldn't do as effectively since I have been living and breathing Creative Commons. My job and peers at Creative Commons are amazing and working for CC, in my capacity at least which I can speak to, is a dream job. If anything, I will be pushing Creative Commons even more by action, projects, and facilitation in another capacity.</p>
<p>Thus, if <a href="http://rejon.org/2008/07/31/jonphillips-4-launch">you want to find out more about what I will be doing</a>, <a href="http://rejon.org">you know where to find me</a>. And, if I've been working with you, your business, your community, and/or organization, <a href="mailto:jon@creativecommons.org">jon@creativecommons.org</a> still works (and will so). I am continuing work on a couple of projects that have not launched in relationship to <a href="http://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a>/PDWiki project. I also am on-demand still for speaking at events and conferences globally - particularly in Asia since I will be spending most time in China from August - December 2008. I'm still on the books and will facilitate any discussions to the appropriate people. I'm more excited that ever to keep growing the commons!</p>
