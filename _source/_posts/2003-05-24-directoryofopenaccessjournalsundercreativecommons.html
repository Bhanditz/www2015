<p><a href="http://www.lub.lu.se/index.html.en">Lund University</a> in Sweden has recently launched the <a href="http://www.doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> featuring hundreds of peer-reviewed, scholarly journals from scientific and cultural communities. Their principal aim is to secure the right of "users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles." Along with the searchable directory, they also provide <a href="http://www.doaj.org/articles/questions/example_oai_record/">metadata records in XML</a> and <a href="http://www.doaj.org/articles/questions/#restrictions">license all their XML under an Attribution-Sharealike license</a>.</p>
