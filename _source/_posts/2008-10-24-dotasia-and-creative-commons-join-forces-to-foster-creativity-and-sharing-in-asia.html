<p>The creativity of Asia's people will be supported and shared thanks to a new long-term strategic collaboration between the <a href="www.registry.asia">DotAsia Organisation</a> and Creative Commons (CC).</p>
<p>DotAsia, the not-for-profit registry operator for the ".Asia" Internet top-level domain, plans to commit US$100,000 to Creative Commons in support of its cause, outreach and community efforts in Asia. In addition, DotAsia will contribute time and effort into assisting in the coordination of events, activities of CC's regional chapters and various other socio-technical initiatives, such as a next generation copyright registry project.</p>
<p>The collaboration will be announced by the CEO of Creative Commons, Mr. Joi Ito, and Mr. Edmon Chung, the CEO of DotAsia, during the launch ceremony next Saturday afternoon (Oct 25) for Creative Commons Hong Kong (CCHK) at the HKICC Lee Shau Kee School of Creativity, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

<p>"We are thrilled to work with Joi and the brilliant team at Creative Commons", said Edmon Chung, "this strategic alliance matches the core mission of DotAsia to promote Internet development and adoption in Asia. It also helps strengthen our connection to the worldwide IPR community. Stay tuned <a href="http://www.creativecommons.asia">here</a> for CC activities in Asia."</p>
<p>"The contribution from DotAsia is very meaningful to the development of Creative Commons in Asia. Through collaboration with DotAsia," Joi Ito added. "CC can look forward to building stronger rapport with the creative and cultural communities in Greater China and Asia."</p>

<p><strong>About Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach. Creative Commons was built with and is sustained by the generous support of organizations including the Center for the Public Domain, Omidyar Network, The Rockefeller Foundation, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, as well as members of the public. </p>
