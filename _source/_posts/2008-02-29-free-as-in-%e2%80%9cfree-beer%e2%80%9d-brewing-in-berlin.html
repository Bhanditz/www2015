<p class="entrycontent">â€œ<a href="http://www.freebeer.org/">FREE BEER</a>â€ is always something to get excited about -- especially when it's being brewed in your own backyard. If you're in Berlin this Saturday, March 1st, come stop by â€œ<a href="http://freebeer.zeitgeisty.cc">Free as in 'FREE BEER' - Brau-Aktion."</a> We'll be in the brewery â€œ<a href="http://www.myspace.com/hopsandbarleyberlin">Hops &amp; Barley Berlin</a>â€ starting at 12:30pm to witness 100 liters of FREE BEER being brewed and learn some tricks from Braumeister Philipp.</p>
<p class="entrycontent">The bubbly beverage's recipe is based on classic ale brewing traditions and employs a Creative Commons license (Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5) to encourage anyone to brew their own batch or create derivative recipes. With support from <a href="http://zeitgeisty.cc/">zeitgeisty</a> and <a href="http://newthinking.de/">newthinking</a>, this round of FREE BEER is being prepared for consumption at  <a href="http://www.re-publica.de/">re:publicaâ€™08</a>, Berlin's incredibly successful annual blogger conference, to be held this year April 2-4th.</p>
