<p><a href="http://www.jeeran.com/ccarabia/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18581" title="Jeeran Logo 300" src="img/Jeeran_logo_700x4201.gif" alt="Jeeran Logo 300" width="300" height="180" /></a><a href="http://www.jeeran.com">Jeeran</a>, the largest Arabic online community with 1.5 million registered users and more than 7 million visitors per month, <a href="http://www.jeeran.com/ccarabia/">has just launched a dedicated Creative Commons space</a> to inform the developing CC Arab community with articles, news and updates about CC activities in the region. While a large commons culture is still developing in the Arab world, the new Jeeran channel should help provide valuable information to Arab users how to license and share their work online.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the channel is to foster new CC content creation and dissemination of content in the Arabic language.  This is really a fantastic opportunity for the budding CC community in the Middle East because Jeeran has done so much work in the domain of Arabic content creation and language preservation on the Internet.  For an example, <a href="http://ivholdings.jeeran.com/archive/2009/6/893881.html">check out their their innovative project called as Seejal</a> which is transferring an old Arab tradition of poetry onto the web.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeeran.com/ccarabia/">The CC channel on Jeeran</a> will feature blog posts, videos, caricatures and music, as well as successful case studies on how Creative Commons is being used in the Arab Region (e.g., <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net">the Creative Commons Al Jazeera repository</a>). The channel will also contain a section on news and updates on Creative Commons events, meetings and happenings in the Arab Region like the upcoming Jordan launch and CC Salon.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank Laith and Omar, founders of Jeeran, their team, Rami Olwan and Bassel Safadi from our CC Arab community for making this happen!</p>
