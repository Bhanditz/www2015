<p>Over at Boing Boing, Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/06/28/cc-licensed-photo-bo.html">points readers</a> to <em>Snitchtown: The Photo Essay</em>, a wonderful adaptation of his essay, <em>Snitchtown</em>. Originally a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA licensed</a> editorial on "<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/corys-editorial-abou.html">the future of urban surveillance</a>" - specifically the ubiquity of CCTV cameras found in the the UK - the new work, authored by Emma Byrne, is a photo essay that puts images alongside Doctorow's words, specifically photos of CCTV cameras. Naturally, it is CC BY-NC-SA licensed as well.</p>
<p>These stories are inspiring for us as they show our licenses at work doing excatly what we intended them to - helping facilitate interesting and poignant reuse that make the original work richer. Even better is Doctorow's reaction:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is, I believe, my absolute favorite CC adaptation of my work to date; in that it's the first adaptation that I prefer to my original.</p></blockquote>
