<p><a href="http://machineofdeath.net/"><img class="size-full wp-image-25120 alignleft" title="MachineOfDeath" src="img/MachineOfDeath.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="418" /></a>It's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11947">happened before</a> with <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Nine_Inch_Nails_Ghosts_I-IV">music albums</a>, where releasing work openly online did not hurt actual sales of the product. The authors of <em><a href="http://machineofdeath.net/ebook">Machine of Death</a></em> clearly get this. They explain why the science fiction anthology of stories about people who know the manner by which they die (but have no idea when), has been made available online under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Why are we doing this? Arenâ€™t we worried about hurting our book sales?</p>
<p>In a word: no. You have proven time and again that you are willing to pay for content that you find valuable. You have shown that you are driven to share material that you fall in love with. And we are committed to ensuring that you can experience our work whether you can afford to buy a book or not; whether you live in a country that Amazon ships to or not; whether you have space in your life for a stack of paper or not.</p>
<p>Please, download, read, share and enjoy!</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, some of the individual stories are released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> license, which allows you to translate and adapt the work as long as you abide by the noncommercial condition and release the derivative under the same license. <a href="http://machineofdeath.net/category/podcast-episodes">Podcasts</a> are also being created for all the stories, with three stories up so far.</p>
<p>As of right now, <em>Machine of Death</em> is the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/machine-of-death-amazon.jpg">#1 bestselling science fiction anthology on Amazon</a>, and has also made their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_354383602_22?ie=UTF8&plgroup=3&docId=1000628171&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=left-2&pf_rd_r=1T4WJ29ZYSN9N3QRB7NC&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1279095762&pf_rd_i=2486012011">Best Books of 2010 list</a>.
