<h2>More about Creative Commons Korea Association</h2>
<p>Until 2008 the CC project in the Korean jurisdiction had been initiated and led by the team of volunteers at KAFIL (Korea Association for Info-Media Law), the leading law association for information law issues in Korea. With the aim to broaden and improve the management of project activities, KAFIL decided to separate the team of volunteers into an independent legal entity and let the new entity take over the CC jurisdiction project.</p>
<p>Consequently, the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.or.kr/">Creative Commons Korea Association</a> (CC Korea) was founded in January, 2009. As a not-for-profit incorporated association, CC Korea started its activities as the official CC project team in Korea. CC Korea consists of various individuals and corporation members. They will reach decisions for CC Korea through general meetings regarding key management issues. The members also have an obligation to make financial contributions to maintain and run CC Korea. In particular, individual members can be a member of the board or voluntary staff. As of 2009, about thirty to forty voluntary staff with various backgrounds, such as lawyers, students, artists, professors, businessmen and so on, are taking part in many projects to promote open culture including spreading CC in Korea.</p>
