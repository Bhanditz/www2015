Their goal is "to make government data more accessible and comprehensible to the American public" by encouraging designers, artists, and programmers to reimagine government websites and to visualize government data and processes.</p>
<p>Provided you meet eligibility requirements, you can submit work to categories in <strong>Data Visualization</strong>, <strong>Process Transparency</strong>, and <strong>Redesigning the Government</strong>. Contests range from visualizing government data to redesigning government websites. The top prize in each contest is <strong>$5,000</strong>.</p>
