<p>We are thrilled to announce that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> has once again stepped up to support CC during our annual campaign. Microsoft has been generously donating to CC for over 5 years and we are thrilled to have their continued support. Tom Rubin, Chief Counsel for Intellectual Property Strategy, says "CC provides necessary infrastructure for openness, collaboration, and innovation -- all for free, to anyone in the world. Microsoft is very proud to continue its support of this important organization and the crucial public resource it makes available. We encourage other technology companies to do the same." </p>
<p>If you too believe that CC is an important public resource, then please <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">join Microsoft in donating to CC today!</a> </p>
