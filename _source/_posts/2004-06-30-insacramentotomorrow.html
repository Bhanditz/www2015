<p>I'll be at the California state capitol tomorrow morning to talk to the state senate's education committee about the public domain and Creative Commons. I'll be there in a purely informational capacity to provide some context for a broader discussion about community colleges, higher ed, and royalty-free educational materials. More soon.</p>
