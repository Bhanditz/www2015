<p>This week's featured content is <a href="http://pdphoto.org/">PD Photo</a>, a new photo archive containing thousands of photos released into the public domain. Photographer Jon Sullivan has opened up his personal archives of thousands of photos and made them free for re-use. <a href="http://pdphoto.org/PictureHome.php?mat=pdef&md=fav">His favorites</a> are a good place to start if you're looking for high quality outdoor and landscape photos to use in web, print, or post designs.</p>
