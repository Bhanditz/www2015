<p><a href="http://ficlets.com">Ficlets</a> is a neat new site from AOL for collaborative fiction writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write 1024 characters or less.</li>
<li>Others can write a sequel or prequel to your ficlet.</li>
<li>Everything is licensed under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm particularly excited to see this because something like it has been in the back of my head (and doubtless millions of other heads) since the beginning of the web, but everytime I daydreamed about it the collaboration got too complex to be fun (to implement as a web app or to participate in). The incredibly simple parameters above look <em>perfect</em>!</p>
