<p><a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki?title=Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2011"><img width="150" style="float:right;padding:10px" alt="Yellow banner -- May 4th, 2011: Day Against DRM" src="img/Dadrm2011-yellow-triangle.png" /></a>Today is a good day to learn about Digital Rights Management, or more accurately Digital <em>Restrictions</em> Management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection of blog posts from <a href="http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2011#Blog">Day Against DRM 2011</a></li>

<p><a href="https://readersbillofrights.info/librariansagainstDRM"><img src="img/block_lad_logo_left.png" style="float:left; padding:10px" /></a>Although DRM seems to no longer be the red hot issue it was a decade ago, it is still very much present, causing problems regarding fair use, lack of competition, privacy and security breaches, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Obsolescence">forced obsolescence</a>, and more. DRM is often now involved in distribution of movies and books, to the great consternation of some <a href="https://readersbillofrights.info/librariansagainstDRM">librarians</a>. Not listening to librarians puts our freedom and safety at risk.</p>
<p>A few things about DRM specific to Creative Commons:</p>
<ul>
<li>CC licenses do not allow licensees to use DRM to prevent other licensees from taking advantage of the freedoms the licensor granted. Sounds good, but a license isn't necessarily the place to put everything good -- and the wisdom of this condition has been hotly debated in in years past. We <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#DRM">decided not to change it in version 3.0</a>. With discussion of version 4.0 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27141">upcoming</a>, should we think about refining the language?</li>
<li>Read our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Is_Creative_Commons_involved_in_digital_rights_management_.28DRM.29.3F">FAQs regarding DRM and CC</a>.</li>
<li>DRM puts CC's values in stark relief. DRM attempts to use technology to make it harder to share and collaborate; we want to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about">use technology to maximize sharing and collaboration</a>. DRM is anti-social, CC is pro-social.</li>
<li>In the long term, DRM will lose if collaboration and sharing win. This will <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5771">take decades</a>, or perhaps not so long if you get involved in open <a href="http://creativecommons.org/culture">culture</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">education</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Government_use_of_Creative_Commons">government</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/science">science</a> and our older cousins in the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">free software movement</a> (who have spearheaded this Day Against DRM).</li>
</ul>
