<p>When we published <a title="Open Doors and Open Minds" href="http://sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/opendoors_v1.pdf">Open Doors and Open Minds</a>, we promised a companion piece that discusses in detail some of the legal considerations that university administrators and university general counsels may wish to consider in adopting a public access policy. I'm happy to say that this is now available. This excellent companion piece, providing a thorough overview and careful analysis of legal issues related to public access policies, is written by Simon Frankel and Shannon Nestor, who are lawyers at Covington &amp; Burling, a prominent Washington D.C. law firm. It is available in the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/resources/readingroom/">Reading Room</a>. I wish to thank them for their contribution of this wonderful resource for public access champions, and we look forward to distributing this widely.</p>
