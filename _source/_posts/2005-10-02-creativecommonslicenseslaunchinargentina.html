<p>Silicon-Valley-based NGO reinforces its activities around the globe</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, USA and Berlin, GERMANY â€” October 1, 2005 â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon, today unveils a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Argentina.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">groupâ€™s website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Project Leads Professor Ariel Vercelli and Professor Pablo Palazzi to adapt the standardized licenses to Argentinean law. The Creative Commons Argentina project team is supported by the FundaciÃ³n OSDE, and the nonprofit NGO Bienes Comunes.</p>
<p>Today the Argentinean versions of the Creative Commons licenses will be launched in Buenos Aires, at a ceremony held at the Centro Cultural General San MartÃ­n (Sarmiento 1551, Sala D, 12:00 AM). As part of the launch event,   Professor Lawrence Lessig (Chairman and CEO of Creative Commons) and Professor Ariel Vercelli, (Chairman of Bienes Comunes and Project Lead of the Creative Commons team in Argentina) will give lectures that will be <a href="http://www.terra.com.ar/creativecommons/">webcast live</a>.</p>
