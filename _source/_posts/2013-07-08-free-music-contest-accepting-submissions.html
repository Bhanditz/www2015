<p>Once again, our friends at <a href="http://bandcamp.musikpiraten-ev.de/">Musikpiraten e.V.</a> are hosting the annual <a href="http://musik.klarmachen-zum-aendern.de/free-music-contest-2013-en">Free! Music! Contest</a> to find the best Creative Commons&#8211;licensed music of the year. CC is proud to serve as a partner in this year's F!M!C.</p>
<p><a href="http://musik.klarmachen-zum-aendern.de/free-music-contest-2013-en">From Musikpiraten e.V.</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Patron of this year's contest is Victor Love, lead singer of the Italian cyperpunk band <a href="http://www.dopestarsinc.com/">Dope Stars Inc.</a>. In 2011, DSI separated from their label and released their album <em>Ultrawired</em> as a free download via <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay</a>. They had been the first band that had ever been featured with a "Doodle" on the BitTorrent search engine's landing page. Since that release they have been playing worldwide on various festivals.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>As in the last years, a double-CD packed to the brim with the best songs of the contest is going to be produced. A jury chooses the best tracks and takes care that the best of every genre is featured - from Trash Metal to Hip Hop and Blues, whatever the artists submit. Moreover, vouchers worth 100â‚¬ will be raffled among all participants - even the willingness to make one's music free shall be rewarded! Last but not least, there will be a gig near Heidelberg to win. Due to travelling costs, this one is very likely to go to a band from Germany.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the full contest rules in <a href="http://musik.klarmachen-zum-aendern.de/free-music-contest-2013-en">English</a> or <a href="http://musik.klarmachen-zum-aendern.de/free-music-contest-2013">German</a>. Entries are due July 31.</p>
