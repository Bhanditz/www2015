<p><a href="http://anepsosis.xstylee.org/news.php">Anepsosis</a>, an open-source 3D <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG">MMORPG</a>, has recentlly decided to release all of their game art (which includes texts, pictures, sketches, drawings, 3D art, and sounds) under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">BY-SA</a> license. This allows all the content created by the Anepsosis community, not just the final game, to remain open and free, adding additional functionality to the already open-source project (Anepsosis is being released under the <a href="http://anepsosis.xstylee.org/page.php?4">GNU GPL Version 2</a>).</p>
