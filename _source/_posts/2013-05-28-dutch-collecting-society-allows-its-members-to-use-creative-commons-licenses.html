<p>Last week <a href="http://www.bumastemra.nl/">Buma/Stemra</a>, the Dutch collecting society representing musical authors, made the decision to allow its members to use non-commercial Creative Commons Licenses on a permanent basis. This decision comes after a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7622">6 year pilot project</a> between Buma/Stemra and Creative Commons Nederland that allowed Buma/Stemra members to do so on an experimental basis.</p>
<p>The pilot was originally launched in the summer of 2007 and represented the first collaboration between Creative Commons and a collecting society representing musical authors. Outside of the United States, members of these societies are required to exclusively assign their rights in their entire repertoire to the society when they decide to become a member. As a result, they do not have the right to license their own works under Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p>The Buma/Stemra and Creative Commons Nederland pilot represented a first attempt to change this. As part of the pilot, members of Buma/Stemra could license some of their works under the three Creative Commons licenses that allow free non-commercial uses of the licensed works (BY-NC, BY-NC-SA, and BY-NC-ND). At the same time, the collecting society continues to collect for commercial uses of the licensed works. The model established by the Dutch pilot has since been adopted by pilots in <a href="http://www.creativecommons.dk/press-release-danish-collecting-society-koda-teams-up-with-cc-denmark/">Denmark</a> (with KODA in 2008) and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31205">France</a> (with SACEM in 2012), and serves as the basis for ongoing discussions in a number of other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Creative Commons welcomes the step taken by Buma/Stemra that underscores that the Creative Commons licenses are a valuable tool for creators of all types of works. Allowing authors of musical works to use some of the Creative Commons licenses provides them with more flexibility in exploiting their works and allows them to engage with their audiences in new ways. We hope that more collecting societies will follow the example set by Buma/Stemra.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the ability of collecting society members to use open content licenses is also being discussed in the context of a <a href="http://www.communia-association.org/2013/01/07/communia-policy-paper-on-proposed-directive-on-collective-management-of-copyright/">European Union proposal on regulation of collecting societies</a>. In response to the European Commissionâ€™s proposal for a collective rights management directive [<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/management/com-2012-3722_en.pdf">PDF</a>] (a binding legislative instrument that has to be implemented by all 27 member states of the Union), the Culture and Education committee of the European Parliament has tabled an amendment that would allow all members of collecting societies to use non-commercial licenses. In her <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fNONSGML%2bCOMPARL%2bPE-508.071%2b01%2bDOC%2bPDF%2bV0%2f%2fEN">draft opinion</a>, the rapporteur of the Education and Culture committee, <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28240/HELGA_TRUPEL_home.html">MEP Helga TrÃ¼pel</a>, wrote:</p>
<p>The Rapporteur would like to stress that rightholders should have the possibility to make their works available under an open content license of their choice, for instance under Creative Commons, without necessarily opting out from the collective management system.</p>
<p>While it is unclear at this point in time if her amendment will make it into the final version of the directive, such a step would mean that collecting society members all across Europe would be awarded the same flexibility that members of Buma/Stemra have enjoyed since 2007.</p>
