<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Costa_Rica"><img class="size-full wp-image-22866  alignright" title="Flag_of_Costa_Rica_(state).svg" src="img/Flag_of_Costa_Rica_state.svg_.png" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a>We are happy to announce <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Costa_Rica/3.0/BY-NC-SA/Draft">an experiment</a> in the public discussion process of our licenses, piloted by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/cr/">CC Costa Rica</a>. Customarily, we post a static text document of the licenses, including a re-translation and summary of changes in English, to our website. The community can download these files and submit comments on the jurisdiction's mailing list. In an effort to improve usability and the level of interaction, we've wikified the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Costa_Rica/3.0/BY-NC-SA/Draft">Costa Rican BY-NC-SA 3.0 license draft </a>, so you can read and discuss the text directly.</p>
<p>To contribute a review or question regarding the license draft adapted to Costa Rican law, please visit the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Costa_Rica/3.0/BY-NC-SA/Draft">BY-NC-SA 3.0 license draft page</a> and click on the wiki's discussion page to share your thoughts. You are also welcome to join and write to the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-costa-rica">CC Costa Rican mailing list</a>, which will run in parallel to the wiki.</p>
<p>The public discussion is an open forum where everyone â€“ from lawyers to active license users, from linguists to translators â€” is invited to contribute and improve the license texts. Comments should be submitted as soon as possible to allow enough time for review, so we encourage you to post to the list before the end of August 2010, when the discussion is scheduled to close.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ongoing efforts of Project Leads Rolando Coto, Carlos E. SaborÃ­o Romero, and Denis Campos with the support of the <a href="http://www.ucr.ac.cr/">University of Costa Rica</a>, and to AndrÃ©s Guadamuz for producing the draft and soliciting feedback from the Costa Rican public. We look forward to the discussion and to testing this new process!</p>
