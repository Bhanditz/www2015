<p><a href="http://www.lasilky.org/"><img src="img/wndw.jpg" border="0" style="float:right" /></a><em><a href="http://wndw.net/">Wireless Networking in the Developing World</a></em> is a free book about designing, implementing, and maintaining low-cost wireless networks. The <a href="http://wiki.wndw.net/mw/index.php/WNDW2_Release">second edition has just been released</a> under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license with versions in English, Spanish, French, Italian, <a href="http://www.lasilky.org/">Arabic</a>, and soon Portuguese.</p>
<p>For a bit on why a book on wireless networking in the developing world may be particularly interesting, see last November's post on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7841"> Building a Rural Wireless Mesh Network</a>, which very conveniently also happens to be available under an Attribution-ShareAlike license.</p>
