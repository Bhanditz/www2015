<p>LluÃ­s Gendrau is the publisher of the <a href="http://enderrock.com/">Enderrock Group</a>, a company that specializes in Catalan music and publishes three popular music magazines: <em>Enderrock</em> (pop and rock), <em>Folc </em>(traditional music) and <em>JaÃ§</em> (jazz). Enderrock â€“ in collaboration with the government of Catalonia â€“ recently included two CDs full of CC-licensed music, <em>MÃºsica Lliure and </em><em>MÃºsica Lliure II, </em>free within the page of its magazines. The songs on the <em>MÃºsica Lliure</em> discs are available for free download at <a href="http://culturalliure.cat/">culturalliure.cat.</a> Read more about this project in our new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/enderrock">Featured Commoner interview</a>.</p>
