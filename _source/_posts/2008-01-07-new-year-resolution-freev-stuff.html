<p>Craig Neilson writes about his <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007716.html">three 2008 resolutions at WorldChanging</a> -- (1) Be vegetarian, (2) Walk, (3) Free stuff, where <em>free</em> is a verb:</p>
<blockquote><p>This year I want to set stuff free, which is easier than it sounds. I'm contributing to Wikipedia, publishing more helpful personal web pages and licensing my Flickr photos with the most generous Creative Commons license available.</p>
<p>This is the kind of group activity that causes massive change. Information can be an unlimited resource when we free it - a move that costs little and benefits many. What's exciting about freeing stuff is that you don't know how your stuff could be used.</p></blockquote>
