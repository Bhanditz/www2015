<p>In the winter of 2006, NOVA embarked on an "<a title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/production/" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/production/" target="_blank">open production</a>" experiment, asking viewers to contribute by reading and commenting on a preview of their show's script---the (then) in-progress documentary, "<a title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/" target="_blank">Car of the Future</a>." The show's producers liked the results, and according to the Wired Blog Network's <em><a title="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/04/when-tonights-n.html" href="http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/04/when-tonights-n.html" target="_blank">Underwire</a></em>, NOVA decided to return the favor by "[giving] the material back."Â </p>
<p>For the first time ever, PBS and NOVA have released 240 clips of <a title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/open/" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/open/" target="_blank">raw footage</a> from the making of the "Car of the Future" documentary online. The videos, which include full-length interviews with world-renowned scientists and engineers (in addition to various footage of the high-tech vehicles themselves), is free for viewing, sharing, and remixing under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial License (<a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC</a>). NOVA <a title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/open/rules.html" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/open/rules.html" target="_blank">encourages</a> you to take this footage and "create your own video or multimedia project about tomorrow's cars, environmental issues, or other related topics you care about." They also ask you to send them back your finished product if you want, so that they canÂ <a title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/open/share.html" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/car/open/share.html" target="_blank">feature</a>Â the best videos on their site.</p>
