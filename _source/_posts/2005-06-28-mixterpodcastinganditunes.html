<p>Today Apple released a new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> that includes Podcasting capabilities. I was happy to see while browsing the audio blogs category that there was a "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=73329754&selectedItemId=73329754">CCMixter for podcasters</a>" (iTunes link) channel with a few tracks off our <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">CCMixter site</a>.</p>
<p>If you're new to podcasting, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">wikipedia has a good summary</a>, and if you want to try your hand at podcasting and worry about music licensing, using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/">Creative Commons licensed audio</a> is a great way to find music you can freely use.</p>
