<p>I just stumbled upon a <a href="http://31d1.com/">great little site</a> for electronic musician 31d1. There are beat loops, mixes, and even great little videos, all under a Creative Commons license. The video "gloucester" was my favorite, with public-domain looking video of a fly doing its thing.</p>
