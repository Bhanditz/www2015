<p>There's about a week left to enter CC Australia's <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/poolingideas">Pooling Ideas</a> competition before it closes on March 23. They're giving away cool prizes, including an internship with ABC Radio National to co-produce <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/nightair/default.htm">The Night Air</a> and mountains of CC gear.</p>
<p>Contestants are invited to creatively interpret the theme <strong>We are what we share</strong>, and upload their creation to <a href="http://www.pool.org.au/poolingideas">Pool</a>. It's free, and there are no time limits or format requirements. Just tag your work <a href="http://www.pool.org.au/explore/tags/we_are_what_we_share">we are what we share</a> when you upload.</p>
<p>You can already check out the first few entries: a <a href="http://www.pool.org.au/text/bright_garlick/ode_to_the_priest_of_krako">poem</a>,  a <a href="http://www.pool.org.au/text/george_koulakis/old_man_ted" target="_blank">story</a> and a <a href="http://www.pool.org.au/image/susandirgham/i_believe_in_syria">picture</a> (with some great accompanying text). So what are you waiting for? Grab your camera, pen,  computer and get creative!</p>
