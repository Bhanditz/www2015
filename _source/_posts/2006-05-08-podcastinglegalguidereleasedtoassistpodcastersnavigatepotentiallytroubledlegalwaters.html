<p>San Francisco, USA â€” May 8, 2006</p>
<p>Creative Commons and Vogele & Associates today unveiled the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Welcome_To_The_Podcasting_Legal_Guide">Podcasting Legal Guide</a>, which was prepared by both organizations together with the invaluable assistance of the Berkman Center at Harvard Law Schoolâ€™s Clinical Program in Cyberlaw.  The Guide was prepared as part of the Stanford Center for Internet & Societyâ€™s Non-Residential Fellowship.  Inspired by the Electronic Frontier Foundationâ€™s <a href="http://www.eff.org/bloggers/lg/">Legal Guide for Bloggers</a>, the Podcasting Legal Guide is designed to outline both legal and practical issues that are specifically relevant for podcasters, such as using music and video in a podcast.</p>
<p>The Guide has been <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Welcome_To_The_Podcasting_Legal_Guide">published</a> both online and as a PDF under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 license</a>.  A hardcopy of the Guide can also be ordered via <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> in print-on-demand for $5.37 (<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/285352">black & white</a>) or $10.83 (<a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/299500">color</a>).  The authors hope that the flexible license chosen will enable practitioners in different jurisdictions to translate and adapt the guide for their own jurisdictions to assist podcasters around the world.</p>
<p>â€œThis is an exciting time,â€ said Colette Vogele, founder of <a href="http://www.vogelelaw.com/">Vogele & Associates</a>.  â€œWith the proliferation of user-generated and user-manipulated content on the web through podcasting and other technologies, anyone has the potential to become a publisher of original or remixed content overnight.  At the same time, these new media technologies remain for the most part legally untested. We hope this Guide will encourage readers to take an active role in understanding the legal issues affecting their podcasts, and implement techniques and resources to podcast legally.â€</p>
<p>â€œThe body of copyright and related laws that governs the use of other peopleâ€™s content in a podcast is, as Larry Lessig notes in his foreword to the Guide, â€˜insanely complex,â€™â€ noted Phil Malone, co-director of the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/clinical">Berkman Centerâ€™s Clinical Program</a>. â€œThis Guide seeks to serve as a common-sense overview of some of that complexity and to help podcasters understand the variety of alternatives they might have to safely use music, video and other materials.â€</p>
<p>To coincide with the release of the Guide, Creative Commons has <a href="http://creativecommons.org/podcasting">released</a> podcast promos from several prominent artists including <a href="http://djspooky.com/">DJ Spooky</a>, <a href="http://throwingmusic.com/">Kristin Hersh</a>, <a href="http://jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a>, <a href="http://finianmckean.com/">Finian Mckean</a>, and <a href="http://aurevoirsimone.com/">Au Revoir Simone</a>. These promos are available for podcasters who use CC-licensed music to include in their podcasts.  Creative Commons invites other artists to submit promos for inclusion at the site.</p>
