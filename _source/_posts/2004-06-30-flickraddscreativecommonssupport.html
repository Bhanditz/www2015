<p><a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2004/06/creative_common.html">Over at the new Flickr blog</a>, they've announced support for Creative Commons in Flickr. Flickr's a site to share photos like no other: it's a social software application that lets you define friends and family, you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/learn_more_2.gne">annotate photos</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/learn_more_3.gne">share photos in a live chat</a> using an innovative interface, form groups around topics, and now you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=12779">license your photos</a>.</p>
<p>If you've got a digital camera or camera phone, and don't have any place to post your photos, consider signing up for Flickr and applying a CC license to all your shots.</p>
