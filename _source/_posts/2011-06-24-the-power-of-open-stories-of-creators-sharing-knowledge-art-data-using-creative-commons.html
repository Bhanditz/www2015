<p>Since last fall, we've been talking at length to various creators about their CC stories---the impact Creative Commons has had on their lives and in their respective fields, whether that's in art, education, science, or industry. We are thrilled to announce that we have cultivated the most compelling of these stories and woven them together into a book called <em><a href="http://thepowerofopen.org">The Power of Open</a></em>. The stories in <em><a href="http://thepowerofopen.org">The Power of Open</a></em> demonstrate the breadth of CC uses across fields and the creativity of the individuals and organizations that have chosen to share their work via Creative Commons licenses and tools.</p>
<p><em>The Power of Open</em> is available for free download at <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org">http://thepowerofopen.org</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution license</a>. It is available in <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/downloads/">several languages</a>, with more translated versions to come. You can also order hard copies from <a href="https://www.lulu.com/commerce/index.php?fBuyContent=10826809&fBuyProductType=print&cid=en_cms_email_freebook2011">Lulu</a>. We hope that it inspires you to examine and embrace the practice of open licensing so that your contributions to the global intellectual commons can provide their greatest benefit to all people.</p>
<p>We could not have produced this work without the support of all of our creators, many of whom began telling their stories at our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies wiki project</a>, which we encourage you to contribute to---as your story may also be highlighted in publications like <em>The Power of Open</em>!</p>

<p>We would also like to extend deepest thanks to our sponsors, without which this book would just be a bunch of undeveloped stories sitting on a wiki.
