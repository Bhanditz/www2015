Thanks to everyone who donated to help us meet Twitter's $3,000 matching giving challenge in record time! This is particularly great news, since today marks <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/19346">CC's 7th birthday</a>, so thanks to Twitter and thanks to everyone who donated - we've now raised a total of $6,000 toward our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">annual fundraising campaign</a>! </p>
<p>We're honored to have Twitter's support, since the social networking site has played a huge role for CC over the past year. We use Twitter to engage directly and efficiently with people worldwide who care about participatory culture and the innovation and social good that come from it, and as a nonprofit we're grateful for this valuable medium for giving and getting feedback, promoting projects, and announcing milestones. If youâ€™re not one of the more than 240,000 people already following us on Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/creativecommons">visit our page</a> and become one! It's a simple way to stay up to date with all things CC.</p>
<p>Help ensure that Creative Commons is around for another seven years! We need everyoneâ€™s contribution in this final push for our 2009 annual campaign, so please <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate today</a></strong>!</p>
