<p>Today the U.S. Department of Labor, in coordination with the Department of Education, <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20111409.htm">announced the first wave of grant winners</a>Â in support ofÂ "targeted training and workforce development to help economically dislocated workers who are changing careers."Â Today's announcement commits nearly <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20111409fs.htm">$500 million to 32 grantees</a>, with a $2 billion investment expected over the next 4 years.</p>
<p>Secretary of LaborÂ Hilda L. Solis said in the Department's press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Making it possible for unemployed Americans to return to work is a top priority of President Obama's. This initiative is about providing access to training that leads to real jobs," said Secretary Solis. "These federal grants will enable community colleges, employers and other partners to prepare job candidates, through innovative programs, for new careers in high-wage, high-skills fields, including advanced manufacturing, transportation, health care and STEM occupations."</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26100">we mentioned in January</a> when the program was announced, we're excited that the grant guidelines includes a requirement that where new learning materials are created using grant funds, those materials must be made available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>. Creative Commons, with its partnering organizations, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27097">is positioned to provide support to grantees</a> on open licensing, learning and course design, professional development, and adoption and use.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the first round winners and to the Department of Labor and Department of Education in supporting this innovative education initiative.</p>
