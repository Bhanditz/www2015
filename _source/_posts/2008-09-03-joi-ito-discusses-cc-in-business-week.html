<p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#93">CC's CEO</a>, recentlly <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/aug2008/gb20080815_901512.htm">sat down with Business Week to discuss Creative Commons</a>, our mission, and how our licenses work the way they do. The article has an obvious focus on the business potential of CC licences but touches on the implications our licences have in the arts and education as well. It's a great write up and hopefully gives a bit of context about where we are right now and where we are headed in the near future.</p>
<p>Outside of CC, the article talks at length about Joi's upcoming photography book, <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/08/01/freesouls-captu.html"><em>FREESOULS</em></a>. <em>FREESOULS</em> features photography Joi has taken over the past year of individuals, both well known and lesser known, that had few or no images of themselves publicly available under a CC licence or in the Public Domain. The book and the images therein are being released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">BY license</a> and many of the photos <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/joi/tags/freesouls/">already available online under the same terms</a>.</p>
