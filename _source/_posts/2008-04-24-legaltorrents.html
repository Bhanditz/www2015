<p><a href="http://beta.legaltorrents.com/">LegalTorrents</a>, "an online community created to discover and distribute Creative Commons licensed digital media", has re-launched in exciting fashion. Originally founded in 2003 as a means to distribute "<a href="http://torrentfreak.com/legaltorrents-reopens-080331/">hand-picked .torrent files that were approved by content owners</a>", LegalTorrents revamped its infrastructure to be more friendly to content creators looking to spread their works far and wide, a goal which included a clear articulation of CC-licenses in relation to relevant torrent files. From <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/tips/2008/04/01/download_unambiguously_legal_content_at_legaltorrents-2.html">LifeHacker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each torrent submitted to LegalTorrents is reviewed by moderators for the proper licensing and then posted to the site. Additionally, LegalTorrents hosts a high-speed seed for each torrent, guaranteeing that you should always be able to get fairly high-speed transfers; in my tests the downloads were indeed very fast (downloading over 400 KB/s).</p></blockquote>
<p>As with most <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Content_Directories">content directories</a>, LegalTorrents becomes more relevant the more people use it. With that in mind, check out their growing pool of CC-licensed work, contribute your own, and offer any feedback you may have that could improve what LegalTorrents is trying to accomplish.</p>
