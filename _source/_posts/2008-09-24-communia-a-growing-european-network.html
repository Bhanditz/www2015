<p>Earlier this month, Mike gave us <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9249">a sneak preview</a> of several not-to-be-missed conferences in Europe this October. <a href="http://www.communia-project.eu/">COMMUNIA</a> kicks off the list with its <a href="http://www.communia-project.eu/node/109">3rd Workshop</a>, this time held in Amsterdam on October 20-21. The Amsterdam workshop will tackle <em>Marking the public domain: relinquishment &amp; certification</em>, and the <a href="../weblog/entry/9071">CC0 beta/discussion draftÂ 3</a> will be one of the main items on the agenda.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://communia-project.eu/communiafiles/louvain_hires.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9658" title="louvain_all" src="img/louvain_all_cropped1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="155" /></a></p>
<p>The workshop follows the successful <a href="http://communia-project.eu/node/142">COMMUNIA Conference 2008</a>, held at the University of Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium on June 30 and July 1. The conference furthered COMMUNIA's mission to enrich and inform the debate about various (and often under-represented) issues related to today's copyright. In particular, the COMMUNIA network continues to improve understanding about the true value of the public domain and open licensing.</p>
<p>All materials produced by the COMMUNIA network can be <a href="http://www.communia-project.eu/downloads">downloaded</a> from the <a href="http://communia-project.eu/">COMMUNIA website</a>, which is in itselfÂ a great resource for the latest news in intellecutal property, copyright and public domain issues around the world.</p>
