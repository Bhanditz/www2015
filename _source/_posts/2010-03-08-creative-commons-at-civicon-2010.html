<p>Creative Commons depends on a lot of free software to scale our activities on the web.  One of the most important pieces is CiviCRM which we use to manage our contributions and contacts.  CiviCRM has been on an amazing trajectory since we first started using it in 2006: new releases continue to bring functionality our users ask for, and the developers and community have been great to work with.</p>
<p>If you're a CiviCRM user, or looking for a CRM/Donor Management package for your organization, you should attend the first ever <a href="http://civicrm.org/civicrm/event/info?id=37&reset=1">CiviCon</a>, taking place April 22 in San Francisco.  I'm very proud that Creative Commons is taking part in the event: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#nathankinkade">Nathan Kinkade</a> will be presenting on our <a href="http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/CiviCon+April+2010+Session+Proposals">work to streamline the contribution process</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#nathanyergler">I'll</a> be presenting the opening plenary session.  </p>
<p><a href="http://civicrm.org/civicrm/event/info?id=37&reset=1">Register here</a> for CiviCon -- I hope to see you next month!</p>
