<p><a href="http://groundreport.tv/">GroundReport.TV</a>, a streaming citizen journalism news channel online, <strike>has officially launched and</strike> needs your help! They are looking for CC-licensed documentaries and video news content to broadcast on the channel as well as people interested in reporting live from around the world.</p>
<p>We've talked about <a href="http://groundreport.com/index.php">GroundReport.com</a>, GroundReport.TV's companion site,<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7270"> here before</a>. Both sites are great examples of how CC licenses can positively contribute to the growing realm of citizen powered media by providing a clear and established means of identifying user-generated content. When CC licenses are built into communities like <a href="http://groundreport.tv/">GroundReport.TV</a> and <a href="http://groundreport.com/index.php">GroundReport.com</a>,  the sharing of vital information becomes more simplified, ultimately leading to a stronger online "ecosystem".</p>
<p>To get involved with GroundReport.TV, simply visit <a href="http://groundreport.tv">their website</a> and hit the "Participate" link</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A clarification - GroundReport.TV has not <em>officially </em>launched. They are simply in the process of finding CC-licensed content from people like you. Apologies for the confusion!</p>
