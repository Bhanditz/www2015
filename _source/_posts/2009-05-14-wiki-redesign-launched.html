<p>Last month <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14201">we rolled out a brand new look for CC's homepage</a>, and promised that other changes would follow. Staying true to our word, we now invite you to check out our redesigned <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Main_Page">wiki</a>, which boasts a much sleeker and more user-friendly interface and look. The wiki is home to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">CC Case Studies project</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Events">upcoming event information</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer">resources for software developers</a>, and much more. </p>

<p>The wiki is designed to get you involved and collaborating with us; anyone with an account or an <a href="https://creativecommons.net/h/openid/">OpenID</a> can login and add to certain pages. If you're a member of the <a href="https://creativecommons.net/">CC Network</a>, your profile acts as an OpenID. Not yet a member? Support the work of Creative Commons and <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">join the CC Network today</a> to get an OpenID!</p>
<p>We need your contributions to continue developing this wiki into a valuable community resource, so check out the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> page and jump right in!</p>
