<p>A long-standing provider of open courseware, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm">MITOpenCourseWare</a> reached a million visit milestone yesterday for two of their online courses: <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Physics/8-01Physics-IFall1999/CourseHome/index.htm">8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics</a> and <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/CourseHome/index.htm">18.06 Linear Algebra</a>. The courses are two of MIT's most popular to date, taught by renowned professors Walter Lewin and Gilbert Strang. From MIT's <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/about/media/million_milestone/million_milestone.htm">media coverage</a> on Lewin:</p>
<p>"<em>Professor Lewin is an international webstar. He is well-known at MIT and beyond for his dynamic, inspiring and engaging lecture style. His courses are also among the most downloaded at iTunes U. 8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics explains the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics, fluid mechanics, and kinetic gas theory, and a variety of interesting topics such as binary stars, neutron stars, and black holes.</em>"</p>
<p>On Strang:</p>
<p>"<em>Strang is a 50-year mathematics veteran whose teaching style is recognized internationally. Linear Algebra introduces mathematical concepts that include matrix theory, systems of equations, vector spaces, and positive definite matrices. "Everyone has the capacity to learn mathematics," says Strang. "If you can offer a little guidance, and some examples, viewers discover that a whole world is open.</em>"</p>
<p>8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics offers lecture notes, exams with solutions, complete videotaped lectures and their accompanying transcripts under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>. 18.06 Linear Algebra offers (interactive) Java applets with sound in addition to video lectures and translations into Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish, also under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>. CC BY-NC-SA allows for these kinds of adaptations and derivations of material---and translation is a crucial step in broadening access to a global audience.Â </p>
<p>There are other and more interesting ways to adapt material, however, and we are curious to know how the visitors constituting the 1,000,000+ hits of these two courses (and others) have actually used the materials. Since educational needs vary contextually, it would be beneficial to know what types of adaptations are being made beyond translation. Of the 600 visits per day that these courses average, how many of them result in derivations? These, and other questions (such as visitor demographic, global reach, etc.) are things to consider as the OCW project continues to expand and evolve. The future impact of OER lie in the ways information is conceptualized, organized, and related; simply offering up free content on the web is no longer enough---remember David Wiley's quote from OpenEd 08: "If my students can Google it, I don't have to teach it." As progressive models of OER develop and evolve, it will be interesting to see how OCW's scope and impact also grows.</p>
