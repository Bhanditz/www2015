<p>San Francisco â€” November 28, 2007</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that the plaintiffs in the Chang litigation, previously reported at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680">http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680</a>, have voluntarily dismissed Creative Commons from that lawsuit. Although we are confident that any court would have agreed that there was no valid legal claim against us, this is a good result. It was highly gratifying to have so many of our legal friends offer to represent us pro bono.</p>
<p>We thank them for supporting Creative Commons' mission. But we prefer to devote our resources to doing the ongoing work of developing and distributing content licensing tools that are as clear and easy to use as possible.</p>
<p>Creative Commons CEO Lawrence Lessig makes this comment: "I applaud the decision of plaintiffs' counsel to remove Creative Commons from this lawsuit. We work hard to make our work clear, but it is absolutely clear that there is no basis in law for the suit they filed against us."

Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach. Creative Commons is sustained by the generous support of organizations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as members of the public.
