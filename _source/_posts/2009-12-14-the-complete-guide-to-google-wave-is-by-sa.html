<p><img src="img/googlewave-2.jpg" alt="googlewave" title="googlewave" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />Gina Trapani and Adam Pash are editors at <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a>, but over the last couple of months they've been penning (wiki-ying?) a guide to <a href="http://">Google Wave</a>. Their hard work has paid off as a preview edition of <a href="http://completewaveguide.com/">The Complete Guide to Google Wave</a> is now available for purchase as a DRM-free PDF. The first edition of the book will be debuting in January as both a PDF and a softcover print book with new editions to follow throughout 2010.  </p>
<p>What's particularly salient to those in the CC-community is that Trapani and Pash have authored and collaborated on the book using <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> and are releasing its content under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike license</a>. This means the book is not only compatible with Wikipedia (allowing it to be imported to and exported from the encyclopedia), but also free to share, sell, and reproduce online - a decision that is already bearing fruit in the form of a full <a href="http://completewaveguide.com/guide/Google_Wave_%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89">Japanese translation</a>. </p>
<p>You can learn more about the project at <a href="http://completewaveguide.com/">their website</a>, where the guide will continue to be freely available.</p>
