<h3>Wave 2 Kick-off Event, Minneapolis MN</h3>
<p>Round 2 Grantees from the US Department of Laborâ€™s (DOL) <a href="http://www.doleta.gov/taaccct/">Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College & Career Training</a> (TAACCCT) program were invited to attend last weekâ€™s Kick-off Conference, hosted by <a href="http://www.open4us.org">OPEN Partners</a>: CC, CMUâ€™s OLI, CAST, and SBCTC.  This was a unique opportunity for the Gates-funded OPEN Partners to explain services made available to grantees at no cost, supporting the building of Open Educational Resources (OER) that meet current standards of accessibility, pedagogically-sound and technology-supported design, as well as legal openness.  Creative Commons is leading the OPEN Partner services and support, lending expertise in legal and technical aspects of open education to the project.  Representatives from forty seven Round 2 TAACCCT projects attended workshops to understand service basics, and a showcase to hear from select Round 1 Grantee projects that made use of the complementary services offered to all grantees.</p></p>

<p>Highlighted Round 1 <a href="http://open4us.org/about/grantee-showcase/">Grantees</a> included <a href="http://www.nationalstem.org/">The National Stem Consortium</a> (NSC), the <a href="https://secure.collegeincolorado.org/Career_Planning/Explore_Careers/Energy/Whats_the_Deal.aspx">Colorado Online Energy Training Consortium</a> (COETC), and the <a href="http://mccatoday.org/mohealthwins/">Missouri Online HealthWINs</a> program, sharing their experiences in the program thus far.  All grantees are funded to support the building of community college-level and technical training courses that will provide opportunities for unemployed and under-employed adults to gain certificates and degrees in high-skilled industries.  The OPEN partners offer expertise to grantees around accessibility frameworks, open-licensing and technical interoperability, and quality standards for online education.  All of the courses and learning materials created in this four year $2 billion DOL grant program are being licensed for reuse with a Creative Commons (CC BY) license, making this the largest <a href="https://creativecommons.org/education#OER">OER</a> production effort to date.  The pool of courseware will include lessons, videos, images, and interactive content for learners in health care, information technology (IT), advanced manufacturing, and other industries that need high-skilled workforce support.  Itâ€™s a big deal.</p>
<h3>Keynote and Plenary Sessions</h3>
<p>CCâ€™s Director of Global Learning, Cable Green, provided the opening keynote for the conference titled Online Technology, Open Licenses, and Open Educational Resources - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cgreen/open-dol-talk-round-2-kickoff-2013">The Opportunity for DOL TAACCCT Grantees</a>.  The <a href="http://www.cast.org/">Center for Accessibility Supportive Technology</a>â€™s (CAST) Samantha Johnston provided an overview of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles, and spoke about accessibility in distance education, which most TAACCCT courses are being developed for.  <a href="http://www.sbctc.edu/">Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges</a> (SBCTC) Boyoung Chae offered a session about creating and managing OER, targeted at new grantees that will likely be collaborating on content in the coming year.  CC, CAST, and the Washington State Board of Community & Technical Colleges (SBCTC) offered multiple hands-on sessions to familiarize grantees with DOL-mandated aspects of their course design, and describe how the OPEN Partners are offering continue support.  CCâ€™s Jane Park led  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/janeatcc/using-the-cc-by-license-workshop-for-2013-open-kickoff">sessions</a> on the CC-BY license and best practices for applying CC licenses to work.</p>
<p>As a special service to grantees, <a href="http://gforsythe.ca/about-2/">Giulia Forsythe</a> joined the OPEN Partners to provide visual recording (see image above) for the major talks.  The creation of visual notes offered another way for participants to understand the big ideas of the speakersâ€™ messages, using sketch-based keywords and symbols to describe connections.  During a lightning around for new grantees, participants from over forty of the funded college and consortia spoke briefly about their projects and plans. Visual representations of these descriptions will soon be posted to the <a href="http://open4us.org">OPEN4us.org</a> site.</p>
