<p>San Francisco, CA â€” November 13, 2007</p>
<p>Today, Creative Commons launched its second annual <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/contest">CC Swag Photo Contest</a>. The contest is an important component of the third annual <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons fundraising campaign</a>, which was launched on October 1.</p>
<p>â€œIt is not only vital that we meet our $500,000 goal for the fundraising campaign, itâ€™s also important to use the campaign as away to disseminate CCâ€™s mission,â€ said Melissa Reeder, Creative Commonsâ€™ development coordinator. â€œThe CC Swag Photo Contest is a great way for people to show their support for Creative Commons.â€</p>
<p>The CC Swag photo contest challenges people to creatively photograph Creative Commons T-shirts, buttons, stickers, and other promotional items (all available at <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/store">CCâ€™s online store</a>). To enter, the photographs must be uploaded to the Flickr group <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ccswagcontest07/">CCSwagcontest07</a>. Please go to the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/contest">official contest webpage</a> to read the other rules and regulations and to see the 2006 contest image archive.</p>
<p>The two winners, chosen by Creative Commons, will be awarded 100 postcards featuring their winning photo. These postcards will also serve as promotional material for Creative Commons and will be distributed internationally to promote CC.</p>
<p>Franz Patzig, one of the winners of the 2006 CC Swag Photo Contest, says that in addition to being a way to support Creative Commons, the contest helped raise his profile as a photographer.</p>
<p>â€œI have been publishing all my photos under Creative Commons licenses since CCâ€™s beginning,â€ Patzig says. â€œI joined the contest for fun; I never expected my photo to be chosen as one of the winners. Since then, many people have used it to illustrate blog postings about the commons, which has brought a lot of attention to my Flickr pages. I've even sold some photographs. I love sharing my work.â€</p>
