<p>The Miro team have put their summer video intern, Parker Higgins to work <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/blog/2008/07/new-channels-free-culture-tv-and-yes-were-open/">launching two new channels for the open-video application</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The goal of these channels is to showcase interesting and entertaining material from all over the internet thatâ€™s been released under open licenses. Free Culture TV is more specialized, and will contain programming from the Free Culture movement: documentaries, lectures, or short films that address the struggle against a permissions-based society. Yes, Weâ€™re Open! will have all kinds of entertainment, from feature length movies to documentaries, shorts, music videos, and anything else you can imagine, all openly licensed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Miro defines 'openly licensed' as:</p>
<blockquote><p> ... an alternative to the â€œall rights reservedâ€ associated with copyright. When people assign an open license to their work, they are giving the public certain rights, like the freedom to copy and distribute, or to remix and mash up, depending on the terms of the license. One popular example are the Creative Commons licenses, which are applied to many of the videos in these channels.</p></blockquote>
