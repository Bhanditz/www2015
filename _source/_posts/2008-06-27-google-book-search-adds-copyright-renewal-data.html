<p><a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Book Search</a> recently did a great service for those interested in the public domain by digitizing a huge amount of copyright renewal data for books dating as far back as 1923. From <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2008/06/us-copyright-renewal-records-available.html">Inside Google Book Search</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you find out whether a book was renewed? You have to check the U.S. Copyright Office records. Records from 1978 onward are online (see <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/records">http://www.copyright.gov/records</a>) but not downloadable in bulk. The Copyright Office hasn't digitized their earlier records, but Carnegie Mellon scanned them as part of their Universal Library Project, and the tireless folks at <a href="http://pg.net/">Project Gutenberg</a> and the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/">Distributed Proofreaders</a> painstakingly corrected the OCR.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of Google software engineer Jarkko Hietaniemi, we've gathered the records from both sources, massaged them a bit for easier parsing, and combined them into a single XML file available for <a href="http://dl.google.com/rights/books/renewals/google-renewals-20080516.zip">download here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This allows for a much clearer (although still somewhat problematic) understanding of which books have maintained their copyright status and which have gone in to the PD. Jakob Kramer-Duffield <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/digitalnatives/2008/06/25/google-book-search-orphan-works-and-the-public-domain/">speaks well to the implications</a> of Google's efforts in pointing out "thereâ€™s a danger [...] that our great knowledge resources from the past are ignored or left to molder, and the difficulty of determining copyright status has been something of a hurdle to digitization efforts thusfar." Peter Suber <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2008/06/easier-proof-that-pd-books-are-pd.html">more succinctly states</a>, "I love the way we can now use free information to free information."</p>
