<p><a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a> founder (and CC board member) John Buckman in an <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2007/03/opinion_piece_i.html">opinion piece for Gig Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1980, Classical music represented 20% of global music sales. In 2000, Classical had plummeted to just 2% of global music sales. What happened? Did all those people suddenly lose their taste for classical music? Or is something else going on?</p>
<p>At Magnatune.com, an online record label I run, we sell six different genres of music, ranging from Ambient to Classical to Death Metal and World Music. Yet Classical represents a whopping 42% of our sales. Even more intriguingly, only 9% of the visitors to our music site click on â€œclassicalâ€ as the genre theyâ€™re interested in, yet almost half of them end up buying classical music. Whatâ€™s going on here?</p></blockquote>
<p>CC licensing is part of the answer, but go <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2007/03/opinion_piece_i.html">read the article</a> for a number of other keen observations.</p>
