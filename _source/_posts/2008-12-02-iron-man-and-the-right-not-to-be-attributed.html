<p>When <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a>, a web developer living and working in England took a photo of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building" rel="tag">Vehicle Assembly Building</a> at Cape Canaveral<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adactio/301112397"> and posted it to Flickr under our Attribution license</a> (which seems to be the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=10240">flavor</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11081">of the month around</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10927">here</a>), he had no idea it was eventually <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1530/">going to end up in the blockbuster feature film Iron Man</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1530/"><img alt="" src="img/IronMan-BeforeAfter-small.jpg" title="Iron Man" class="alignleft" width="360" height="313" /></a></p>
<p>After explaining the terms of the CC license to a studio representative interested in using the photo in the film, Jeremy was told that it would costs at least $1500 to be attributed in the credits. So the studio offered the next best thing in lieu of being attributed properly: cash. But Jeremy turned the money down and just signed the license release anyway. </p>
<p>Besides <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7196">being another example of Hollywood utilizing CC licensed material</a>, this story offers insight into why we developed the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+</a> protocol. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7919">CC+ is designed to help creators negotiate rights outside the scope of the license</a>. For a lot of cases, this turns out to be our NonCommercial provision -- that is, musicians offer their music to their fans under NC and use CC+ to point commercial users to a 3rd party rights broker (like <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/licensing">Magnatune</a>) that handles commercial rights negotiation on behalf of the artist. But here we can see another right being negotiated, that of attribution, which shows just how flexible CC licenses are. </p>
<p>Remember, when you're the creator and owner of a copyrighted work, you have ultimate say over who does what with your work; CC licenses merely help you negotiate the thicket of what that "what" is.</p>
<p>Thanks go to Jeremy for writing up such an important example of CC licensed works being used in the wild.</p>
