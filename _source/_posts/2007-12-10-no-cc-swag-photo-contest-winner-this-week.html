<p>It's sad but true. Because there were no new entries submitted to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ccswagcontest07">CC Swag Photo Contest</a> this past week, we are unable to announce a winner. We only have one week left - so get out there and start shooting. <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/contest">Participating in this contest</a> is a fun and different way to promote and support CC and your own work.</p>
<p>Need inspiration? Maybe you can get a good CC Swag shot at one of the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party">7 CC birthday parties</a> coming up this weekend? If there is a party happening in your area, you should definitely check it out. Otherwise - get creative.</p>
