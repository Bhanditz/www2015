<p>CC Australia has <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7626">another</a> cool announcement today:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>We here at CCAU are always excited to hear about new concepts designed to help Australian/Kiwi creators get paid for what they do, especially when CC licences are involved.  So weâ€™re very happy to call attention to the launch of <a href="http://60sox.org.au">60Sox</a>, a new initiative coming out of the <a href="http://www.ici.qut.edu.au/">Institute for Creative Industries and Innovation</a>.</p>
<p>60Sox is an online network aimed at connecting creative talent with industry professionals. By providing a home to showcase their digital wares, 60sox gives creators the opportunity to generate exposure, make industry contacts, receive feedback and critical appraisal from peers and industry DSLs (dead set legends) andâ€¦wait for itâ€¦ get paid for their work!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As an important part of its ethos of sharing as a vital part of promotion and creativity, 60Sox encourages creators to upload their materials under a Creative Commons licence. 60soxâ€™s comprehensive, flexible and easy to follow upload system places it right up there in the CC best practice stakes. It uses the CC â€œAttributionâ€“NonCommercial-ShareAlike Australia 2.5â€ licence as its default upload licence, but gives users the option to use another CC licence, or even all rights reserved if they wish. By doing so, 60sox actively promotes the exchange of artistic works in the digital domain and encourages creative interaction (eg through remixing), but at the same time retains creatorsâ€™ freedom to choose their own licensing model to meet their own preferences.
