<p>Creative Commons will soon be turning 7 (<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2009">Help us celebrate</a>!), and we're in the midst of our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">5th annual fundraising campaign</a>, our yearly effort to raise public awareness and support of our mission to promote free and legal sharing of creative works. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCNewsletter">This newsletter</a>, from September-December 2009, is a testament to how important our work is, and includes all of the highlights from the past couple months, including stories of new jurisdiction launches, a Nobel Prize for work concerning "the Commons," CC-licensed feature-length films, and much more.
