<p>One of the many cool aspects of the <a href="http://wiredmag.com/">November issue of WIRED</a> are <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.11/beastie.html?pg=3">the blurbs about each artist</a> who contributed to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">the CD</a>. In the print mag, they dot the many-page Creative Commons spread like Easter eggs. Example:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>Track 7: Dan the Automator/Relaxation Spa Treatment</p>
<p>The busy brain behind groups like Deltron 3030, Dr. Octagon, and<br />
Lovage, Dan Nakamura has made a career out of mashing the styles and<br />
sounds of an eclectic array of partners. "The music is always greater<br />
than just the sum of the contributors' parts," he says. Thus a concept<br />
album featuring Brit-pop icon Damon Albarn, underground rapper Del the<br />
Funkee Homosapien, and experimental turntablist Kid Koala could have<br />
easily been a schizophrenic mess, but as produced by Nakamura, the<br />
Gorillaz was a slick and smart style hybrid that became an<br />
international smash. "I make collages," he says. "I'm not the kind of<br />
guy who samples big, obvious loops from hit songs. I'm more interested<br />
in finding lots of random little tones from all over and then creating<br />
a totally new track out of the pieces."</p>
