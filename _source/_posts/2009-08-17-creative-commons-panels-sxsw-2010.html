The <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">SXSW Interactive Festival</a> is always a great opportunity for us to connect with our community and up and coming projects. That's why we're excited to announce our <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/index/interactive/company:Creative+Commons">3 panel suggestions for SXSW 2010</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/3003">Can You Copyright a Tweet?</a></li>
<blockquote><p>What happens if someone sells your tweet on a t-shirt? Or when CNN puts it on their 24 hours news network? These question may initially appear ridiculous, but when authors are penning entire books through their microblogs these are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Join us for a mostly serious look at the implications raised by reuse, syndication and commercial exploitation of microcontent.</p></blockquote>
<li><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2974">Permanence on the Web</a></li>
<blockquote><p>Hard drives fail, DVDs crack, and jump drives get lost. We can store our data in the cloud, but AOL just deleted Geocities and now Kodak is threatening to remove your albums if you don't pay them. Sites like Archive.org and Google's cache represent a partial solution to the problem, but how do we encourage the preservation of a permanent web? What are the laws and ethical issues involved with archiving other people's content?</p></blockquote>
<li><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/3007">DMCA & ToS 101</a></li>
<blockquote><p>Hear from industry experts and lawyers who have crafted the terms for sites you use everyday so that the next time you meet with counsel, you'll be a little more prepared and won't accidentally trigger a user insurrection.</p></blockquote>
</ul>
<p>If you have a minute, go and take a moment to go and vote the panels -- your support will make a difference. Thanks!</p>
