<p>The Food Safety Knowledge network is seeking CC licensed open educational resources in the area of food safety. From their announcement:</p>
<p>"With the increasing demand for safe food and the growing globalization of food production and manufacturing, there is a great need for no-cost, accessible training and educational resources for food safety professionals, especially those working in developing countries where such access is not readily available. <a href="http://www.msu.edu/" target="_blank">Michigan State University</a> and the <a href="http://www.globalfoodsafetyinitiative.com/" target="_blank">Global Food Safety Initiative</a> have partnered together to create the <strong>Food Safety Knowledge Network (FSKN)</strong>, a directory of open educational resources in the area of food safety, which will make quality content easily and efficiently findable.</p>
<p>FSKN will use ccLearnâ€™s <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/DiscoverEd_FAQ" target="_blank">DiscoverEd</a> search tool to draw resources from reliable sources. These materials will be curated by experts in the field as well as aligned to a set of core competencies for food safety managers so that the users can identify the specific area the resource covers as well as trust the quality of the content. This fall, the Food Safety Knowledge Network will be pilot tested to support implementation of supplier training at the pre-certification level in developing countries including India and China.</p>
<p>If you have or know of food safety resources to share, please contact Sunnie Kim at <a href="mailto:kiml@msu.edu" target="_blank">kiml@msu.edu</a>."</p>
<p>All resources that the FSKN integrates into DiscoverEd will have a CC license, with all FSKN site content available via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>.</p>
