<p>We just got this great photo of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/4249">Wissenschaftskolleg conference</a>  from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#18">Christiane</a>, our International Commons Project Coordinator, whom you can see there in the background. Featured in the foreground is Professor Ricolfi, Creative Commons Legal Project Lead from Italy, and to the right of him is Professor JÃ¼rgen Renn, Director of the Max Planck Institute for History of Science. On the very right, is Professor Lessig. <i>Photo by Olivier Menanteau.</i></p>
