<p>Remember the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g-yrjh58ms">infectious video</a> of <a href="http://beatbots.org/">Keepon</a> the robot dancing to <a href="http://www.spoontheband.com/">Spoon</a>'s hit "I Turn My Camera On?" Well, the cute, cuddly droid and the awesome Austin indie band are back together with an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPdP1jBfxzo">incredible new clip</a> for Spoon's "Don't You Evah," shot in Tokyo by director <a href="http://www.shotgunstories.com/director.php">Jeff Nichols</a>.</p>
<p>We're thrilled to announce that the video is available to the world under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">BY-NC</a> license. Feel free to share and remix it!</p>
<p>The video's star (besides Keepon, of course) is none other than the bot's developer, <a href="http://univ.nict.go.jp/people/xkozima/index-eng.html">Hideki Kozima</a>. Keep an eye out for cameos by members of Spoon.</p>
<p>Keepon will reunite with Spoon on September 10 in Los Angeles at the <a href="http://www.wirednextfest.com/">WIRED NextFest</a> <a href="http://wirednextfest.com/inform/event_09.10.07.php">concert</a> to benefit Creative Commons (previously blogged <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7541">here</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">WIRED</a> for making all of this possible!</p>
