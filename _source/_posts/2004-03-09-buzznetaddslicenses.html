<p><a href="http://www.buzznet.com/">Buzznet</a> is a photoblog community offering free hosting space for your digital photos and mobile phone shots. They offer image uploads via your web browser and cameraphones using email, making it easy to setup your own gallery of photos. Recently we noticed they became the first photoblogging service to offer the ability to license your gallery under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p> If you've got a cameraphone or bunch of digital photos you'd like to share, sign up for a new account then simply select a license in the preferences to apply it to all your photos.</p>
