<p>Just a reminder that the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Los_Angeles_Salon">CC Salon LA</a> is back <strong>TONIGHT</strong> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curt_Smith">Curt Smith</a>, solo-artist and co-founder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_fears">Tears for Fears</a>, discussing his decision to release <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8309"><em>Halfway, Pleased</em></a> under a CC license and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/monkturner">Monk Turner</a>, an LA-based multi-instrumentalist (and former <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7981">Featured Commoner</a>) discussing how he has used CC licences and <a href="http://www.archive.org">archive.org</a> to release numerous concept albums that are unique not only in distribution but music style/aesthetic.</p>
<p>Per usual, the Salon will be taking place at the amazing <a href="http://www.foundla.com/sys/shows/creative-commons-salon-2/">FOUND LA Gallery</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1903+Hyperion+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90027,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">Google map</a>) from 7:30PM - 9:30PM. As always there will be <strong>free drinks</strong> to round out the evening - don't miss what is bound to be a great conversation on how CC licensees work on a practical level for musicians in particular but content creators in general. </p>
