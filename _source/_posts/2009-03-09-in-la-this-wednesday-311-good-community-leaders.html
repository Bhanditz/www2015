<p>If you're in Los Angeles, please consider stopping by the GOOD Space (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6824+Melrose+Ave,+Los+Angeles+CA+90038&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.231745,74.707031&ie=UTF8&ll=34.083925,-118.341444&spn=0.009259,0.018239&z=16&iwloc=addr">6824 Melrose Ave.</a>, LA, CA 90038) this Wednesday, March 11, at 7pm for an event that <a href="http://www.good.is/">GOOD</a> is hosting in conjunction with <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org/">Knight Pulse</a> called GOOD Community Leaders.</p>
<p>Representatives from five social initiatives will offer short presentations about their work and talk about some of their ideas for expanding the reach of their respective projects. I'll be talking about Creative Commons - specifically about the importance of effectively communicating CC's work to the general public. Edgar Arceneaux (<a href="http://wattshouseproject.org/">Watts House Project</a>), Erik Knudson and Kelly Coyne (<a href="http://www.homegrownevolution.com/">Urban Homestead</a>), Alissa Walker (<a href="http://www.good.is/?p=16101">Design LA</a>), and Sonja Rasula (<a href="http://uniquelosangeles.com/">Unique LA</a>) will also be presenting.</p>
<p>Admission is free. Red Stripe is providing free beer, and the event is 21+. <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/events/mar11">RSVP</a> is required; more info is available on GOOD's <a href="http://www.good.is/?p=16144">blog</a>.</p>
