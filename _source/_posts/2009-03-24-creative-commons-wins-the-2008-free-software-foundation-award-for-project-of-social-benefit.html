<p>Saturday <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13388">at</a> Libre Planet, the Free Software Foundation's <a href="http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/">annual conference</a>, Creative Commons was honored to <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2008_free_software_awards/">receive the FSF's Award for Projects of Social Benefit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FSF Award for Projects of Social Benefit is presented annually to a project that intentionally and significantly benefits society by applying free software, or the ideas of the free software movement, in a project that intentionally and significantly benefits society in other aspects of life.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2001, Creative Commons has worked to foster a growing body of creative, educational and scientific works that can be shared and built upon by others. Creative Commons has also worked to raise awareness of the harm inflicted by increasingly restrictive copyright regimes.</p>
<p>Creative Commons vice president Mike Linksvayer accepted the award saying, "It's an incredible honor. Creative Commons should be giving an award to the Free Software Foundation and Richard Stallman, because what Creative Commons is doing would not be possible without them."</p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations also to Wietse Venema, honored with the Award for the Advancement of Free Software for his "significant and wide-ranging technical contributions to network security, and his creation of the Postfix email server."</p>
<p>FSF president Stallman presented a plaque by artist Lincoln Read commemorating the award to Creative Commons.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the FSF Social Benefit Award's 2005 and 2007 winners are Wikipedia and <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2007_free_software_awards">Groklaw</a> both because it is tremendous to be in their company and as the former is in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13232">process of migrating</a> to a CC BY-SA license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10443">thanks in large part to the FSF</a>) and the latter publishes under a CC BY-NC-ND license.</p>
<p>Only last December CC was honored to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11828">receive an award</a> from another of computing's most significant pioneers, Doug Engelbart.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the Free Software Foundation and Richard Stallman. Please join us in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9112">continuing to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his founding of the free software movement</a>. As Stallman would say, "Happy Hacking!"</p>
