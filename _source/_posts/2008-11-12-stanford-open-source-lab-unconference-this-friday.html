<p>The Stanford Open Source Lab is a nexus for people in the Stanford University community engaged with open source software, open access, and other forms of openness as users, developers, creators, and more. They've had an excellent workshop series, including a <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/2008/05/12/video-of-cclearn-workshop-is-live/">talk by ccLearn's Ahrash Bissell, available online for your viewing pleasure</a>.</p>
<p>This Friday the lab is <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/wiki/index.php?title=First_(un)Conference">hosting its first conference -- free and open to the public</a>. They've put together a list of speakers (including me), and there's also a self-organizing unconference component.</p>
