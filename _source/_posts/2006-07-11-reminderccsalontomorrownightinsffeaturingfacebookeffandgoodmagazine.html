<p>Join us tomorrow night (Wednesday, July 12, from 6-9pm) at <a href="http://shinesf.com">Shine,</a> (1337 Mission Street between 9th and 10th Streets) for <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/salon">CC Salon!</a></p>
<p><b>This month's line-up:</b><br />
Chris Hughes and Jeff Hammerbacher from <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a><br />
Derek Slater and Jason Schultz from the <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a><br />
Max Schorr of <a href="http://goodmagazine.com">GOOD Magazine</a></p>
<p>We're also going to try something new and will be featuring "OpenSalon" -- an open mic where the community is invited to give short (five minutes or less) off-the-cuff presentations. Show up if you are interested in this chance to demo your new project, play your new remix, get feedback from the community, or shamelessly plug your upcoming event (if it relates to CC, of course!).
<p>Track this event on <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/85776">Upcoming.org</a>!</p></p>
