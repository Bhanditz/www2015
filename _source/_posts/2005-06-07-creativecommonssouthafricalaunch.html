<p>Week before last, Creative Commons South Africa officially launched at the <a href="http://www.commons-sense.org/">Commons-Sense: Towards an African Digital Information Commons</a> conference in Johannesburgh. The launch event and conference, primarily organized by Heather Ford, South Africa Project Lead, and Andrew Rens, South Africa Legal Lead, was nothing short of spectacular. </p>
<p> The launch event on the night preceeding the conference was well attended by leaders in arts, technology, education, and government. South Africa-based band 340 Milliliters rocked the house alongside an art gallery of Creative Commons licensed works.</p>
<p>
Following the launch began the 2-day Commons-Sense conference sponsored by the <a href="http://link.wits.ac.za/">LINK Centre</a> (at Wits University) and funded by the <a href="http://web.idrc.ca/en/ev-1-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html">International Development Research Centre</a>.  The groundbreaking conference collected 120 leaders from around Africa, and the world, to talk about what a digital commons means specifically to the social and economic context of the continent.  There was a <a href="http://www.commons-sense.org/pages/schedule.htm">terrific bill of speakers</a> who addressed issues including access to knowledge, open access publishing, traditional culture IP, medicines, free trade agreements, and technology.  </p>
<p>Specifically worth mentioning was a talk given by Eve Gray from the <a href="http://www.hsrc.ac.za/">Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa</a>, who discussed how HSRC's early experiments with open access publishing paid off.  As they made their research papers available for free download, the print revenues went up by 270%.</p>
<p>
The conference was well reported on, with a crew of young journalists from the <a href="http://nml.ru.ac.za/">New Media Lab</a> covering the <a href="http://nml.ru.ac.za/cs/">blow-by-blow</a> with blogs, images, and videos from the conference, in addition to a great article written in <a href="http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/national.aspx?ID=BD4A51747">Business Day</a> about the launch event.</p>
<p>There was much hope that this conference would be a jumping off point for greater activism in Africa using technology, and tools like Creative Commons as enablers for social and economic development.</p>
