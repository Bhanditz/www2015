<p>Thanks to all who donated in the past week and had your gift doubled by <a href="http://www.miraverse.com/">the Miraverse</a>. The Miraverse has matched $5000 in your donations, bringing in a total of $10,000 this week for our fundraising campaign. We still need help reaching our $550,000 goal by December 31, so if you haven't yet donated please <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">give today</a> and join with the Miraverse in supporting CC.</p>

<p>Here's why the Miraverse supports CC:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Miraverse is an environment for developing new media productions and reaching new audiences through increased participation at every level and at every step of the creative process.  Without the past work--and success--of Creative Commons, there would be no legal basis from which we could presume to proceed.  But because of their great work we can begin our venture with the confidence that millions upon millions now understand that copyright need not be the end of creativity, but a potential beginning of an infinite number of wonderful futures.  We are delighted to support an organization that has laid the foundation for us, and we accept that the best way to ensure a better future for everything we do is to support those who are doing the best work today.</p></blockquote>
<p> Can you <a href="https://www.creativecommons.net/donate">give $25, $75, or $100</a> to support the future of creativity and the work of Creative Commons? </p>
