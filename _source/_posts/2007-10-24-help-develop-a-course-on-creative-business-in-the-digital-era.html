<p><a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/creativebusiness/blog/?p=3">Announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Open Rights Group, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.01zero-one.co.uk/intro.htm">01zero-one</a> and funded by the <a href="http://www.lda.gov.uk/">London Development Agency</a>, is beginning an exciting new research project, examining how the internet enables creative entrepreneurs to develop innovative business practices by being more open with their intellectual property. <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/creativebusiness/">Creative Business in the Digital Era</a> will examine new business models and the wider context in which they sit, culminating in one day-long and two evening courses at which we will share our findings.</p>
<p>In the fine tradition of eating our own dogfood, we are developing the course out in the open, and under a Creative Commons licence, using a <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/creativebusiness/index.php/Main_Page">wiki</a>. But we need your help. We have only a couple of months to do our research, so we need you to help us shape of the course, figure out the format of the case studies, and carry out research. Time is genuinely tight - we must complete all the course materials by the beginning of February, ready for delivery in March.</p>
<p>Right now, this week, we need your ideas. What open-IP business models have you come across? And who is experimenting with opening up their IP?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a fantastic project with a mandate to deliver results quickly. You can participate in the research phase immediately just by tagging relevant resources on del.icio.us with <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/org-cbde">org-cbde</a>, or dive into the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/creativebusiness/">course development wiki</a>.
