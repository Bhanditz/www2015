<p>Two more sets of International Commons are available: from Spain and Canada. One cool feature these licenses have in common is that both are bilingual. The Spanish licenses are available in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/es/deed.es">Castilian Spanish</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/es/deed.ca">Catalan</a>, and the Canadian in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/ca/">English</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/ca/legalcode.fr">French</a>.</p>
<p>Accounts of the launch events, by those Commoners who attended them, are coming soon.</p>
