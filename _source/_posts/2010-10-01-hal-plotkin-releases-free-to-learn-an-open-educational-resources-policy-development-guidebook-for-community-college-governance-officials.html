<p>Yesterday Hal Plotkin announced the release of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Free_to_Learn_Guide"><em>Free to Learn: An Open Educational Resources Policy Development Guidebook for Community College Governance Officials</em></a>. The guide explains how the flexibility and diversity of Open Educational Resources (OER) can improve teaching and learning in higher education, all while retaining quality and enabling resource sharing and collaboration. <em>Free to Learn</em> features case studies and highlights several interviews with leaders of the OER community. The document suggests that community colleges are uniquely positioned to both take advantage of OER opportunities and to become pioneers in teaching through the creative and cost-effective use of OER.</p>

<p>â€œThe tremendous promise of Open Educational Resources for advancing the mission of higher education is clear,â€ said Hal Plotkin, author of <em>Free to Learn</em>. â€œHigher education governance officials need only summon the will and enact governing board policies that institutionalize support for OER to move these activities from the periphery of higher education to its core, where the results would be truly transformative. We hope that this guide provides a starting point that builds understanding of OER and its incredible potential for transforming teaching and learning.â€</p>
<p>Plotkin currently serves as Senior Policy Advisor to Under Secretary of Education Martha Kanter at the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">U.S. Department of Education</a>, and is a longtime supporter of community colleges and Creative Commons. He is the former president of the <a href="http://www.fhda.edu/">Foothill-De Anza Community College District</a> Governing Board of Trustees and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/All-Hail-Creative-Commons-Stanford-professor-2874018.php">penned one of the first articles</a> about Creative Commons for SF Gate in 2002.</p>
<p>Catherine Casserly, Vice President for Innovation and Open Networks andÂ Senior Partner at theÂ Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of TeachingÂ (and a featured interviewee in <em>Free to Learn) </em>said, â€œKudos to Hal for his visionary leadership in recognizing the enormous potential of OER for improving learning opportunities for community college students, and his tireless efforts to spread the word. His unique perspective as a former community college trustee provides the background to speak directly toÂ higher education policy makers."</p>

The document will be distributed at the October 5 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/communitycollege">White House Summit on Community Colleges</a> in Washington, DC. That event â€œis an opportunity to bring together community colleges, business, philanthropy, federal and state policy leaders, and students to discuss how community colleges can help meet the job training and education needs of the nationâ€™s evolving workforce, as well as the critical role these institutions play in achieving the Presidentâ€™s goal to lead the world with the highest proportion of college graduates by 2020.â€</p>
<p><em>Free to Learn</em> was supported by a grant from <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/">The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>. Congratulations to Hal on publishing this important, timely document.</p>
