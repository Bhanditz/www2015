<p><em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Z3J1uzd0Q">Lo que tÃº Quieras OÃ­r</a></em>, the phenomenal Spanish short film we talked about earlier <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7537">here</a>, has recentlly broken into the "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/browse?s=mp&amp;t=a&amp;c=0&amp;l=">All Time Most Viewed</a>" list on YouTube with upwards of 38,000,000 views! <em>Lo que tÃº Quieras OÃ­r</em> is licensed under a CC <a href="under a CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license">BY-NC-SA license</a>.</p>
<p>Some major kudos are in order for the everyone involved in creating <em>Lo que tÃº Quieras OÃ­r</em> and making it the success it is today. We can only hope that part of the shortâ€™s online success has been enhanced by this decision to utilize CC licensing, which allows its viewers to not only freely distribute the film, but also remix it as long as they give credit, do so with non-commercial intent, and share their new works under the same license. If you haven't already (and the numbers would indicate that you have), be sure to check it out on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Z3J1uzd0Q">YouTube</a> or the film's <a href="http://www.loquetuquierasoir.com/">website</a>.</p>
