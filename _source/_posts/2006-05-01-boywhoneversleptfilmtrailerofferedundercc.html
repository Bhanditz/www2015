From the <a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/9994">press release:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>â€œIâ€™m very excited about how powerful the internet is as a distribution source for movies, and how new technologies like Google video have empowered amateur filmmakers with the ability to reach a large audience and have their work be accessible to everyone. Thatâ€™s powerful,â€ says Solomon Rothman.</p></blockquote>
