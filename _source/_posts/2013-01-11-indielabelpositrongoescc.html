<p><a href="http://www.positronrecords.com/">Positron!</a> Records is <a href="http://www.positronrecords.com/cc/index.php">now offering</a> their artists the option of releasing material under the Sampling or Sampling+ licenses.</p>
<p>Christopher Randall of Positron says: "...our first two actual releases under the CC Sampling+ license are right around the corner. The first record, called 'in a haze' by the noise artist s.sturgis, will be released on Nov. 23rd,  and is at the pressing plant as I type this. </p>
<p>We will be changing the licenses of all our releases to Sampling or Sampling+ as each one gets repressed, unless the artist in question has strictly forbidden it (and we do have one that won't toe the line)."</p>
<p>A very lengthy, well worth reading, can be found on <a href="http://www.sistermachinegun.com/blog.jsp?month=10&year=2004">Chris' blog</a>.</p>
<p>The label's music styles are wide ranging and a very welcome addition to Commons sample pool.</p>
