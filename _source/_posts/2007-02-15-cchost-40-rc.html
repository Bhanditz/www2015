<p>Are you thinking about hosting a web site dedicated to the CC remix culture? How about in the next few day?</p>
<p>The official Release Candidate for the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6026">award winning</a> <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost">ccHost</a> 4.0 is now available (<em>update: RC period is over, thanks to everybody who participated</em>). The code has been running for a few weeks on <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> so we are confident of its stability, we just want to make sure we've got all the kinks out.</p>
<p>This release marks a major step forward for ccHost with many features you've been seeing appear on ccMixter over the last few months: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7235"> playlists</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7238">more</a>), remix radio and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6121">publicize</a> all enabled by the <a href="http:ccmixter.org/media/docs/query">query/formatting engine</a> which is now used for feeds, streaming and our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5784">sample</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5968">pool</a> <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/docs/pool_api_doc">api</a>.  Our own embedded MP3 player, a 2-4x performance boost, AJAX Everywhere and dozens more enhancements are hopefully enough to encourage folks into to giving it a try in the next few days and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=559966&amp;group_id=80503&amp;func=browse">letting us know</a> if you run into problems.</p>
