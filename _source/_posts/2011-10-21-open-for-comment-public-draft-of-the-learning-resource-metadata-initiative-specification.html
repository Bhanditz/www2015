<p>As you may remember, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28719">LRMI Technical Working Group</a>, with the input of the wider community, has been working to create a set of metadata terms to describe learning resources. This set of terms is being developed with the goal of gaining acceptance into the <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> specification.</p>
<p>Today I am pleased to share with you the current <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LRMI/Properties">draft version of the LRMI specification</a>. We are sharing this now so that the wider community has a chance to review and make comments. We know, as well as anyone, that sharing early drafts of the work product is a great way of improving the end result.</p>
<p>Please review the current <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LRMI/Properties">draft LRMI spec</a> and post any technical comments you might have to the public <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/lrmi">LRMI mailing list</a> by November 11. If you have other non-technical comments/concerns, please feel free to use the <a href="http://www.lrmi.net/discuss">LRMI.net discussion board</a>.</p>
