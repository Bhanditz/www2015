From the beginnings of the Free Software Movement, to Wikipedia's Inception, to Lessig founding Creative Commons at Harvard Law School, Bollier thoughtfully examines the principles and circumstances that helped nurture our digital commons from idea to (meta)physical reality.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a book that both serves as an introduction to and argues for the ideals behind a digital commons, look no further. And if you're planning on reading the book in the bed, bath or beach, <a href="http://www.viralspiral.cc/buy-book">purchase a hard copy at Amazon or other fine bookstores.</a>. </p>
