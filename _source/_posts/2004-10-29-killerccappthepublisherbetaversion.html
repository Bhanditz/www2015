<p>Leveraging the <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive's</a><br />
generous offer to host Creative Commons licensed (audio and video)<br />
files for free, we recently completed the 0.96 beta version of <b>The Publisher</b>,<br />
a desktop, drag-and-drop application that licenses audio and video<br />
files, and sends them to the Internet Archive for free hosting. </p>
<p>When you're done uploading, the application gives you a URL where others can download the file. It also is able to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/embedding">tag MP3 files with Creative Commons metadata</a> and publish verification metadata to the Web. A HUGE congratulations to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#31">Nathan Yergler</a>, who's done an amazing job with this. Also, a great thanks to Jon Aizen and the folk at the Internet Archive. You can <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher/">download the Publisher from here</a> -- give it a test run and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Also note that aside from being downloadable from Internet Archive,<br />
these tagged MP3s can flow on to P2P networks, and be identified as<br />
Creative Commons licensed (see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4476">our Lookup app</a> we recently also <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/lookup/">updated to 0.96</a>). <a href="http://www.morpheus.com/">Morpheus</a> is currently the only file sharing application to identify Creative Commons licensed files.</p>
<p>
Here are some screenshots of how it works:</p>

goes through the Archive's curatorial process (ususally within 24 hours.</em></p>
