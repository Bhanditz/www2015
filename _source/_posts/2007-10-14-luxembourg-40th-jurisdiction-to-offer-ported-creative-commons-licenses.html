<p>October 15, 2007 â€”  San Francisco, CA, USA and Luxembourg, Luxembourg</p>
<p>The launch of the Creative Commons licensing suite today in Luxembourg marks the 40th  jurisdiction worldwide to offer Creative Commons licenses adapted to national law. Creative Commons worked in collaboration with Luxcommons ASBL, a local non-profit for researching and developing Open Content headed by Patrick Peiffer, to linguistically and legally port the licenses to Luxembourgish law.</p>
<p>An event to commemorate the launch will be held today at the Public Research Center Henri Tudor (CRP) in Luxembourg, featuring speeches by John Buckman, founder and CEO of Magnatune.com and Board Member of Creative Commons, and Paul Keller, Project Lead for Creative Commons Netherlands.</p>
<p>The ceremony will also include a presentation by Laurent Kratz, founder Luxembourgâ€™s Jamendo, one of the largest music portals offering Creative Commons-licensed works, and Lionel Maurel, scientific coordinator from the National Library of France.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons licenses were â€œthe first instrument of choiceâ€ in Luxcommonsâ€™ efforts to lead innovation in intellectual property and promote Open Content in their region and around the world. The licenses, available free of charge at <a href="http://creativecommons.org,">http://creativecommons.org,</a> allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditions, and thereby enable others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>About Luxcommons</p>
<p>The non-profit Luxcommons was founded in 2005 with the goals of promoting, researching, and developing of Open Content. Thanks to funding from â€œ2007, Luxembourg and Greater Region, Cultural Capital of Europe,â€ the National Cultural Fund and with the Support of the Technoport Incubator (an initiative of the Henri Tudor Research Center), Luxcommons was able to start transposing the CC 3.0 License to the Luxembourg jurisdiction. For the future, a stronger linking of similar initiatives in the Greater Region and stronger tie-ins with institutional partners is sought to keep the Luxembourgish CC project on stable footing.

<p>About Creative Commons</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach. Creative Commons is sustained by the generous support of organizations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as members of the public.
