<p>Creative Commons is very pleased to announce a new team of Regional Managers to its ranks. </p>

<p>New hires Jonas Ã–berg (Europe), Carolina Botero and Claudio Ruiz (Co-Managers, Latin America) will join existing CC staffers Chiaki Hayashi (Asia and the Pacific), Donatella della Ratta (Arab World), Aurelia J. Schultz (Africa), and our new Network Affiliate Coordinator, Jessica Coates, to form a new team dedicated to supporting our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">affiliate network</a> worldwide.</p>
<p>Creative Commons has affiliate teams operating in over 70 countries, all of whom work to support the CC licenses in their local regions, while at the same time providing valuable expertise and input to CC's broader work internationally. Many of these teams are volunteers, who undertake CC work because of a strong commitment to sharing and openness. </p>
<p>Adding staff support for our affiliates is part of a broader strategy CC is currently implementing to enhance the role and profile of this affiliate network. The Regional Managers will be dedicated to supporting and working with these local affiliates, while also working together to inform and shape CC's ongoing development and policy making. They will also be instrumental in planning for our upcoming <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011">Global Summit</a>---watch this blog for more news on that soon.</p>
<p>Each Regional Manager is based within their region, or has a strong history working with the region's community. Several of the managers are long-running country leads drawn from the affiliate network itself. They bring a broad range of experience and expertise to their positions, from experience in private business to academia to experience within other core free culture organizations.</p>
<p>We welcome our Regional Managers on board, and look forward to their contributions to our community.</p>
