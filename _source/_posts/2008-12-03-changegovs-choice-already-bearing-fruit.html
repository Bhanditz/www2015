<p>Less than 72 hours after <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11081">the Obama-Biden Transition Team adopted our most permissive license</a> for <a href="http://change.gov">Change.gov</a>, <a href="http://ventana.cerado.com/">Cerado Ventana</a> has built a Change.gov <a href="http://ventana.cerado.com/change/v/index_main.php">iPhone, mobile application, and widget</a>.  We will never know if this application would have been built if Change.gov hadn't chosen such a permissive license, but it just goes to show <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=11118">what interesting things can happen when you let the world know your work is free to be built upon</a>.</p>
<p>We originally caught this <a href="http://twitter.com/miketrap/statuses/1036644910">via Twitter</a> and Christopher Carfi's <a href="http://www.socialcustomer.com/2008/12/take-changegov.html">"Social Customer Manifesto" blog where he expressed thanks to Obama's team for using CC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you again to the Obama administration for opening up Change.gov with Creative Commons to make this possible, and thanks to everyone here on the team.  You have been building killer technology, and have enabled us to create this new conduit for citizens and government to connect.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just the beginning of innovative uses of the content from Change.gov, so keep an eye out for more interesting applications and let us know about them.</p>
<p>Check out the widget after the jump.<br />
