<p>The <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/wired/winners">final winners</a> of the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/freestylemix">Freestyle Mix, and the Milita Mix contests</a> have been announced on Mixter. The top eleven Freestyle Mix entries have won a spot on the Creative Commons release, The WIRED CD -- Ripped. Sampled. Mashed. Shared. (playing off <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">the original WIRED CD</a>), and free passes to the <a href="http://www.m3summit.com/main.php">M3 Music Summit</a> in Miami. The <a href="http://ccmixter.org/file/norelpref/1">top track</a> of the Militia Mix Contest won a spot on the next <a href="http://www.fineartsmilitia.com/">Fine Arts Militia Album Featuring Chuck D.</a>              Brian Hardgroove of Fine Arts Militia has this to say: "Overall, I would have been proud to put most of those mixes on the new record -- mad props to the producers."</p>
<p>We'd like to offer a huge thanks to all the contestants and judges, and specifically to <a href="http://ccmixter.org/by/victor">Victor Stone</a> for building Mixter and moderating the site (more on Mixter later).  This experiment has yielded some great music that will hopefully promote the concept of <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/getcreative/">collaboration over space and time</a>, even further. </p>
