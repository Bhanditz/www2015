<p>Today marks the public-launch of <a href="http://vinismo.com/en/Main_Page">Vinismo</a>, "a project to create a free, complete, up-to-date, and reliable guide of all wines in the world". Vinismo utilizes a collaborative wiki-infrastructure that will hopefully lead to a detailed, readable, useful wine guide for people at any level of expertise.</p>
<p>Vinismo is founded by <a href="http://vinismo.com/en/User:Evan">Evan Prodromou</a> (of <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page">WikiTravel</a> - blogged earlier <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5864">here</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7572">here</a>) and <a href="http://vinismo.com/en/User:Nikolai35">Nicolas Ritoux</a>. The entire site is published under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license</a>, meaning that the guide is free for anyone to copy, modify, or publish in any medium. By utilizing this flexible CC license, Vinismo presents itself as an amazing gateway for those looking to understand the complexities surrounding the wonderful, yet dense, world of wine-dom, eventually putting a bevy of information at their fingertips.</p>
<p>It is great to see CC licences being used in new and innovative ways, of which Vinismo is surely grouped. Most importantly, Vinismo allows would-be wine connoisseurs to focus their resources on buying wine rather than buying wine-books. As any collaborative effort based on the sharing of knowledge, a strong community is needed to get Vinismo off the ground. So pop your corks, set-up an account, and get to it!</p>
