<p>Last week the Association of American Universities (AAU), Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), and the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) released a draft plan on how theyâ€™d support public access to federally funded research aligned with the February 22 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf">White House public access directive</a>. The <a href="http://www.arl.org/storage/documents/publications/share-proposal-07june13.pdf"><strong>SH</strong>ared <strong>A</strong>ccess <strong>R</strong>esearch <strong>E</strong>cosystem</a>, or SHARE, is a plan that would draw upon existing university infrastructure in order to ensure public access to publicly funded research. SHARE works through a federated system of university repositories. Participating universities would adopt a common set of metadata fields for publicly funded research articles. The metadata will communicate specific information so the article may be easily discovered through common search engines. Minimum metadata will include author name, title, journal, abstract, and award number. The university-focused SHARE plan was announced in the same week as <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/06/04/joining-a-chorus-publishers-offer-the-ostp-a-proactive-modern-and-cost-saving-public-access-solution/">CHORUS</a>, an effort championed by a coalition of commercial publishers.</p>
<p>In order to promote broad access and reuse of publicly funded research outputs, the SHARE proposal says that federal agencies need to be granted permissions that enable them to make the deposit system work. Therefore, universities and principal investigators need to retain sufficient rights to in turn grant those permissions (access, reuse, archiving) to the federal agencies. From the plan:</p>
<blockquote><p>Copyright licenses to allow public access uses of publications resulting from federal awards need to be awarded on a non-exclusive basis to the funding agency responsible for deposit in order for that system of public deposit to work [...] Federal funding agencies need to receive sufficient copyright licenses to peer-reviewed scholarly publications (either final accepted manuscripts or preferably final published articles) resulting from their grants to enable them to carry out their roles in the national public access scheme. Such licenses would enable the placement of peer-reviewed content in publicly accessible repositories capable of preservation, discovery, sharing, and machine-based services such as text mining, once an embargo has expired.</p></blockquote>
<p>The need for universities and researchers to maintain rights to make their research available under open licenses is aligned with the recommendations that Creative Commons made to the federal government in our testimony during the public hearings at the National Academies. In our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/9/93/NASFederalAgencieshearingonopenaccessarticles.pdf">comments</a>, we urged agencies to allow authors to deposit articles immediately in a repository under a worldwide, royalty-free copyright license that allows the research to be used for any purpose as long as attribution is given to the authors. By making it possible for authors to make their research articles available immediately as open access, federal agencies will be clarifying reuse rights so the downstream users know the legal rights and responsibilities in using that research. This would include important reuse permissions noted in the SHARE proposal.</p>
<p>We also suggested that federal agencies require that authors deposit their manuscripts into a public repository immediately upon publication in a peer reviewed journal. This is also in line with the SHARE plan. If an embargo is present, the SHARE repository will link to the commercial publisherâ€™s website. And once the embargo period expires, the repository would be able to â€œflip onâ€ access to the article which would then made available under the open license. </p>
<p>The SHARE proposal also notes, â€œlicensing arrangements should ensure that no single entity or group secures exclusive rights to publications resulting from federally funded research.â€ It is important that universities and scholarly authors properly manage copyrights from the get-go in order to make sure that the final manuscript is made publicly available under the requirements set out by the White House public access directive. This important consideration <a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/advocacy/nih/copyright.shtml">has been widely discussed</a> at the federal level when the NIH Public Access Policy went into effect. In addition, <a href="http://roarmap.eprints.org/">universities have passed open access policies</a> that reserve the legal rights to archive research conducted by their faculty. And <a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/author/completeonline.shtml">author-level copyright tools</a> have proved to be useful for faculty to preserve some rights to the articles to which they submit to commercial publishers. </p>
