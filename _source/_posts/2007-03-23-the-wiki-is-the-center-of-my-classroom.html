<p>That's a quote from <a href="http://wikiblogedu.org/">Wikis and Blogs in Education</a>, one of three <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/312">educational remixes</a> from students of open content pioneer <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/">David Wiley</a>.</p>
<p>The other two are <a href="http://interviewingbasics.org/">Interviewing Basics</a> and the <a href="http://openwaterproject.org/">Open Water Project</a>, an excellent disaster preparedness video that probably everyone should watch.</p>
