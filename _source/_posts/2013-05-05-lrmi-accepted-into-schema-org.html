<p>The <a href="http://lrmi.net">Learning Resource Metadata Initiative</a> (LRMI) specification (<a href="http://www.lrmi.net/the-specification">14 properties</a>) has been accepted and published as a part of <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, the collaboration between major search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex (<a href="http://www.lrmi.net/worlds-leading-search-engines-recognize-lrmi-as-education-metadata-standard">press release</a>). This marks the culmination of a year&#8217;s worth of open collaboration with the LRMI Technical Working Group and the wider education publishing community. To view the LRMI properties within the context of the full Schema.org hierarchy, visit <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">schema.org/CreativeWork</a>. See this <a href="http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/philb/2013/04/24/lrmi-in-schema/">post</a> by Phil Barker for additional detail.</p>
<p>The LRMI, a simple tagging schema that draws from and maps easily to existing metadata frameworks (e.g., IEEE, LOM and Dublin Core), is intended to be an easy way for open and proprietary content publishers to standardize the way they describe the education specific characteristics of their resources.</p>
<p>This is wonderful news as the LRMI specification will be a piece of the future of education, especially as it pertains to Open Educational Resources (OER). Some of the features of LRMI will allow next generation learning systems based on personalized guided learning. To get a better idea of what kinds of things are possible with LRMI, watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKcZ8ozCah0">OSCON keynote by Danny Hillis</a> describing the concept of a Learning Map.</p>

<p>Creative Commons is currently working with 10 different OER platforms and repositories to implement LRMI support and we hope to announce the first few complete implementations in the coming months.</p>
<p>To join the ongoing discussions around LRMI support and implementation, please join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/lrmi">public mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>And... Creative Commons is hiring a new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/38235">LRMI Project Manager</a>. Please send us the best and brightest to lead this important project!</p>
