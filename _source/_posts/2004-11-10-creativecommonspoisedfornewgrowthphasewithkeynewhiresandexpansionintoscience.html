<p>The Silicon Valley nonprofit takes on<br />
new personnel as it prepares to explore a Science Commons, continue its<br />
rapid international expansion, and build upon the precocious success of<br />
its first two years.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SAN FRANCISCO</span>,<br />
USA November 10, 2004 Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to<br />
expanding the range of creative and intellectual works free to share<br />
and build upon, today announced the creation of two new staff positions<br />
as the organization makes the transition from meteoric start-up to<br />
online institution and begins applying its model to scientific research.</p>
<p>Silicon<br />
Valley veteran Mark Resch joins Creative Commons as its overall Chief<br />
Executive Officer, while entrepreneur and metadata expert John Wilbanks<br />
joins as the Executive Director of Science Commons, a newly formed<br />
branch of the organization.</p>
<p>Creative Commonsâ€™ long-time core<br />
staff, led by Executive Director Glenn Otis Brown, Assistant Director<br />
Neeru Paharia, and international affairs directors Christiane<br />
Asschenfeldt and Roland Honekamp, will continue on in more specialized<br />
versions of their roles. Under this leadership team, the number of web<br />
pages carrying Creative Commons copyright licenses has grown from zero,<br />
in December 2002, to around five million today. The nonprofit now<br />
offers its free legal tools in nine different languages, with around<br />
three dozen more translations in draft. The organizationâ€™s most recent<br />
accomplishments include the sampling- and copying-friendly licensing of<br />
the <span class="caps">WIRED CD</span>, a 16-track album featuring the<br />
Beastie Boys, David Byrne, and other top artists, as well as the debut<br />
of a unique semantic-web search engine, which now ships with Mozillaâ€™s<br />
industry-leading browser, Firefox 1.0.</p>
<p>â€œIn just two years,<br />
Brown and Paharia have led the Creative Commons team from the basement<br />
of Stanford Law School to the cover of <span class="caps">WIRED</span>,â€<br />
said Lawrence Lessig, chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law<br />
at Stanford, referring to the November issue of the magazine. â€œAs the<br />
new overall <span class="caps">CEO</span>, Resch brings a specific and<br />
crucial skill-set to Creative Commons at this phase in its growth. The<br />
core staff are now free to focus on their intense substantive workload,<br />
while Resch will help the expanded organization become a broad and<br />
stable movement.â€</p>
<p>â€œWilbanksâ€™s addition as leader of the new<br />
Science Commons branch also marks a very exciting new phase,â€ said<br />
Lessig, â€œas the Creative Commons model is tested in unchartered areas<br />
of intellectual endeavor.â€</p>
<p>Mark Resch brings to the new <span class="caps">CEO</span></p>
<p>position a wealth of experience developing successful start-up projects<br />
into mature firms. He is chairman and co-founder of the interactive<br />
system maker Onomy Labs, Inc. and was President and <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Commerce Net,<br />
a nonprofit industry consortium that addressed critical enablers of<br />
Internet commerce. At Xerox, Resch developed new Internet business<br />
opportunities and managed <a href="http://xerox.com">http://xerox.com</a><br />
worldwide. Resch was also co-founder and Vice President of Operations<br />
at Luna Imaging Inc., which created large interactive photography<br />
databases and was funded by the Getty Trust and Eastman Kodak.</p>
<p>Wilbanks<br />
comes to Creative Commons from a Fellowship at the World Wide Web<br />
Consortium in Semantic Web for Life Sciences. Previously, he founded<br />
and led to acquisition Incellico, a bioinformatics company that built<br />
semantic graph networks for use in pharmaceutical discovery.</p>
<p>Structurally,<br />
the Creative Commons corporation will consist of three parallel<br />
projects working in concert and overseen by Resch and chairman Lessig:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creative<br />
Commons the existing organization that focuses on copyright and<br />
cultural subject matter like music, images, and educational materials;
</li>
<li>International Commons the effort to adapt Creative<br />
Commonsâ€™ legal tools to various countriesâ€™ legal systems (over 50 and<br />
counting); and
</li>
<li>Science Commons  a project to build on Creative Commonsâ€™ work in open-access scientific publishing (like <span class="caps">MIT</span>â€™s<br />
Open Courseware and the Public Library of Science) and apply Creative<br />
Commonsâ€™ voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach to patents and<br />
scientific data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Functionally, both Science Commons<br />
and Creative Commons will overlap with International Commons, and<br />
current staffers will enjoy roles that span the various sections of the<br />
organization.</p>
<p>Brown, for example, who coined the phrase<br />
â€œsome rights reservedâ€ to describe Creative Commonsâ€™ middle-ground<br />
approach to copyright, will continue to coordinate messaging strategy<br />
and act as the organizationâ€™s main staff attorney. Paharia, who<br />
directed the development of Creative Commons one-of-a-kind search<br />
engine and its innovative <span class="caps">MP3</span>-tagging protocol, among other projects, will continue to coordinate business and technology development.</p>
<p>Brown, anticipating Creative Commonsâ€™ rapid growth in 2004, first proposed the creation of Reschâ€™s <span class="caps">CEO</span> position over a year ago.</p>
<p>â€œOur<br />
growth has exceeded even our most optimistic expectations,â€ said Brown,<br />
â€œbut by mid-2003 it was already clear that our extremely lean team had<br />
created a movement that would require new skill sets at various levels<br />
of the organization. Weâ€™ve been looking forward to focusing on our<br />
substantive legal and cultural projects full-time, and Mark Reschâ€™s<br />
managerial expertise will help Creative Commons further accelerate its<br />
sustained and stable growth.â€</p>
