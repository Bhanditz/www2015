<p>Not two weeks ago Comixpedia published a <a href="http://comixpedia.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=2535">roundtable on Creative Commons and Webcomics</a>, but perhaps two weeks too soon.  Role playing game company <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> was readying the release under a CC license of a professionally drawn companion comic book to its <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach">Castle Marrach</a> online game: <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/comic/awakenings/">Castle Marrach: Awakenings</a>. Now released, obviously.</p>
<p>Skotos Director of Operations Shannon Appelcline penned an <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_170.phtml">informative column describing how and why they're using Creative Commons for the companion comic book series</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>We've got some of our own methods to protect joint creativity at Skotos. In our <a href="http://www.skotos.net/help/TOS.html">Terms of Service</a> we define what we call "Participatory Content" and "Public Content". If<br />
Creative Commons had been around when we launched in 2000, I think we<br />
might have incorporated their licenses instead, to protect the joint<br />
work that people do at Skotos.</p>
<p>With <i>Castle Marrach: Awakenings</i>,<br />
however, we're doing something new, and thus we finally have the<br />
opportunity to offer a Creative Commons release without having to try<br />
and transition from an older license. Creative Commons very clearly<br />
matches our ideals here at Skotos--our belief that people can come<br />
together on the Internet and jointly create whole works that will be<br />
bigger than their parts. And, it helps us to do a little bit to fill<br />
the hole left behind by the destruction of the public domain, which I<br />
wrote about when I was <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_71.shtml">discussing mythology</a> (and its absence in the modern world).</p></blockquote>
<p>Possibly not what they had in mind, but here's <em>a</em> derivative work:</p>
