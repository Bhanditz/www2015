<p>The <a href="http://www.mirrorimage.com/mi/filmfest05.html">Pawtucket Film Festival</a>, September 10-23 (Rhode Island, United States) includes several Creative Commons-licensed films.  Watch the <a href="http://openvision.tv/pff/">PFF Online Filmcast</a> provided by <a href="http://openvision.tv/">Open Network Television</a>. From the <a href="http://openvision.tv/home/Press/PFF%20Press%20Release.pdf">press release</a> (PDF):</p>
<blockquote><p>As a part of the PFF Online, select filmmakers will be making their work available under copyright licenses generated by the Creative Commons giving them a "flexible range of protections and freedoms" to utilize in their digital distribution. Nathanial Freitas, co-founder of ONTV, says, "In the same way digital music is changing the way musical artists share thier work, filmmakers are seeing the value of completely new distribution models that connect them with viewers and demonstrate the trust they share with their audience."</p></blockquote>
