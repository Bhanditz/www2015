<p>The end of the year is a time for reflection and anticipation. So, each day this week, a different member of the Creative Commons team will spend a few moments thinking about what was great in 2005 and what's great to come in 2006.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about 2005 has been watching artists use the Creative Commons model -- as well as a generally open approach to creating -- to land themselves some <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,69042,00.html">really</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/start.html?pg=8">cool</a> <a href="http://www.lostcatrecords.com/2005/08/jonathan-coulton-goes-popular-science.html">gigs</a>.<br />
I've also loved hearing all of the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/view/media/remix">incredible work</a> going on at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> and watching how <a href="http://ccmixter.org/freestylemix/view/contest/about">CC's</a> <a href="http://ccmixter.org/magnatune/view/contest/about">remix</a> <a href="http://ccmixter.org/copyrightcriminals/view/contest/about">contests</a> have<br />
inspired people to create, collaborate and recreate.</p>
<p>We've got lots of plans for 2006. I'm most excited to help teach kids about making, remixing, sharing and managing their creative work. We've got a load of CC-hosted presentations, performances, contests, workshops and products in the pipeline; I especially can't wait for the release of the new CC compilation album and the launch of a regular CC community salon. And of course, it'll be a thrill to meet new artists and explain to them how Creative Commons can help people collaborate and interact in new, exciting ways.</p>
<p>In short, 2006 is gonna rock. Happy new year!</p>
