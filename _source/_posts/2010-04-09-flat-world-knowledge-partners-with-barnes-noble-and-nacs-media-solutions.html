<p>On April 1, Flat World Knowledge announced its partnerships with Barnes & Noble and NACS Media Solutions (an independent business subsidiary of the National Association of College Stores). The partnerships enable FWK's open textbooks to be distributed in low-cost print form at up to 3,000 college bookstores across the U.S. for the 2010 fall semester. To make sure this wasn't an April Fool's joke, I followed up with some of the folks at FWK about this and other plans.</p>
<p>Basically, all FWK's textbooks are open under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> license. The web version is accessible by anyone---which means you can copy, adapt, and reproduce the content for free (as long as you do so non-commercially and share alike). If you want to adapt it via FWK's platform and easily produce and obtain hard copies of professor or student-customized chapters, then you pay a low-cost fee to download the customized PDF or have the professionally bound textbook mailed to you (about $1.99 per chapter download or $29.99 for the hard textbook). You can also access the physical textbooks at some college bookstores.</p>
<p>This new agreement with B&N and NACS expands the number where the physical texts are available, up to 3,000---wherever local professors have decided to participate. (This includes 639 Barnes & Noble college bookstores.) In addition, a print-on-demand (POD) model is being piloted at a few bookstores in August, with the long term goal to have POD in all. From the <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/flat-world-knowledge-partners-with-barnes-noble-and-nacs-media-solutions-to-lower-the-cost-of-college-textbooks-2010-04-01">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Flat World Knowledge will provide bookstores with digital files of its growing catalog of professionally-developed, peer-reviewed college textbooks. Since Flat World textbooks are openly-licensed, instructors can remix, reorder, add and remove content, and then the bookstore can print and bind high-quality paperback books, often within minutes or hours. </p>
<p>University Book Store, Inc. at the University of Washington in Seattle, and the San Diego State University Bookstore, among others, will be the first to pilot this new process. Students will have the convenience of same-day pick up. POD technology also allows professors to continue to customize and update a Flat World textbook within days instead of weeks of the fall semester starting."</p></blockquote>
<p>The license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>) applies to their print textbooks as well as the print-on-demand versions. In addition, FWK's platform is built on open source software and they have plans to eventually make their XML exportable at no cost, which would allow a user to remix FWK content on their own site. </p>
