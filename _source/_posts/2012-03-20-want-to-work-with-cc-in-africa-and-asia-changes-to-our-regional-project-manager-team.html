<p>Some important changes are taking place in CC's Regional Project Manager (RPM) team, the group responsible for coordinating and supporting our worldwide <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">affiliate network</a>. Two of our RPMs - Chiaki Hayashi, RPM for the Asia-Pacific, and Aurelia J. Schultz, RPM for Africa - will be transitioning out of their current roles to new positions in the CC community. </p>
<p>This makes way for two new RPM candidates to join our team.</p>
<p>Chiaki and Aurelia have both worked with CC for many years, and have long provided support for our Asian and African communities. When the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28403">RPM positions were created last year</a>, they were the logical choices to begin the roles for the Asia-Pacific and Africa. However, with activity in both regions growing rapidly, they each feel they can no longer devote the time to their RPM duties that the community deserves, and so are choosing to step down. Aurelia will spend more time on her <a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#aureliaschultz">existing position</a> in CC HQ's legal team, while Chiaki will continue to work with us as a volunteer Culture and GLAM Special Project Coordinator.</p>
<p>This transition provides an exciting opportunity for two new people to step into the RPM roles for the Asia-Pacific and Africa. You can find the full position descriptions <a href="http://creativecommons.org/opportunities">here</a>, but in summary, each position aims to "assist Creative Commons... with organizational planning, strategic communications, community building, and fundraising in... support of the organizationâ€™s mission, goals and objectives" in the respective region. Essentially, this amounts to supporting our local <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">affiliates</a> to promote use and knowledge of CC, coordinating regional activities and communications, and facilitating collaboration between affiliates and the broader international community.</p>
<p>So if you have an interest in community management, open access and Creative Commons, and have ties to Africa or the Asia-Pacific, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
