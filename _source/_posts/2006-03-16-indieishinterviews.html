<p>Grant Robertson of <a href="http://indieish.com/cc365/">cc:365</a> (now up to 75 tracks) and <a href="http://indieish.com/revolution/">The Revolution</a> has been doing some in depth interviews with CC users.  Check out <a href="http://indieish.com/2006/03/15/interview-john-buckman-of-magnatunecom/">John Buckman</a>, <a href="http://indieish.com/2006/03/10/interview-lisa-debenedictis/">Lisa DeBenedictis</a>, and <a href="http://indieish.com/2006/02/14/interview-scott-andrew-of-scott-andrew-and-the-walkingbirds/">Scott Andrew</a> so far. Buckman's "most shocking revelation" isn't all that shocking (read and you'll see).</p>
<p>Also check out Ben Shewmaker interviewing Grant Robertson on the <a href="http://www.spectrumanalysis.org/?p=6">Spectrum Analysis podcast</a>. Grant does a superb job of explaining and demonstrating the great things about Creative Commons as an interviewer, interviewee and most importantly as a tastemaker. Thanks Grant!</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> Grant was also recently <a href="http://www.thechrispirilloshow.com/help/20060304_grant_robertson_of_cc365.phtml">interviewed on the Chris Pirillo Show</a> about CC:365 and Creative Commons music. <i>Via <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2006/03/cc-365-on-chris-pirillo-show.html">Biotic</a>.</i></p>
