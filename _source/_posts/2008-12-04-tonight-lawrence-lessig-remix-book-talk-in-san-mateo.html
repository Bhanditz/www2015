<p>No plans for this evening? If you're in the SF Bay Area, consider stopping by and hearing Lawrence Lessig give a <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/12/please_come_remix_reading.html">reading from his latest book</a>, REMIX, <strong>TONIGHT</strong> at 7PM at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=11+West+Hillsdale+Blvd.+San+Mateo+CA+94403+&ie=UTF8&z=16&g=11+West+Hillsdale+Blvd.+San+Mateo+CA+94403&iwloc=addr">Barnes & Noble in San Mateo</a>. This will be a great time to meet the founder of Creative Commons and hear more about participatory culture in a digital age.</p>
<p>If you haven't already secured your copy of REMIX, remember that donors who give $500 or more to CC's <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">Annual Fundraising Campaign</a> will receive their very own signed copy of REMIX.</p>
