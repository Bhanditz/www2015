<p>In a <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/11/13-innovation-technology-west-friedman-valdivia">paper</a> released in conjunction with a <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/events/2012/11/13-innovation-agenda" target="_blank">panel</a> discussion, the Brookings Institution identifies promising policy ideas to encourage entrepreneurship and innovative growth in the technology industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We need to <i>improve knowledge transmission </i>through faster adoption of digital textbooks, more <b>widespread use of creative commons licenses for instructional materials developed with taxpayer dollars,</b> and policy changes that speed education innovation."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"In an era of limited resources, educators must figure out how to do more with fewer financial resources. One action that would improve school efficiency and financing is to <b><i>have educational resources developed with taxpayer dollars be licensed under a creative commons license that would improve accessibility to instructional materials</i>. </b>Budget circumstances require schools to get more efficient, boost productivity, and make do with fewer financial resources. While this poses obvious problems for school districts, it also creates the possibility of making changes in business operations that are innovative and transformational."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Throughout each of these initiatives, <i>we should have metrics assessing education innovation implementation and impact</i>. We should determine how fast we are transitioning from paper to digital textbooks, <b>leverage the use of creative commons licenses</b>, and enforce changes in education policy and accreditation that encourage more innovative approaches to learning and achievement."</p></blockquote>
<p>The report also endorses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act">FRPAA</a> legislation that would <i>"mandate public dissemination of federally funded research within six months of publication </i>(for agencies with extramural funding exceeding $100 million)."<br /></p>
