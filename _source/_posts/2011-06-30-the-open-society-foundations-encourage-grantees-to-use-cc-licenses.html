<p>The Open Society Foundations (OSF) have adopted a new <a href="http://www.soros.org/legal/intellectual-property-policy">copyright policy</a> that encourages its grantees to release their outputs under CC licenses. The OSF have long been releasing their own work products under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license, but now they have introduced a new clause to encourage OSF grantees to do the same:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We believe that OSFâ€™s mission is enhanced when our granteesâ€™ Work Product is also made widely available to the public, with appropriate protection of legitimate interests.  To that end, OSF is introducing a new clause into its grant agreements, whereby our grantees must advise OSF whether or not they will broadly license all Work Product created with OSF funds using a Creative Commons license, or otherwise."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Public Health Program, Information Program and Media Program are piloting this new policy with their grantees this year. For more information, read the <a href="http://www.soros.org/legal/intellectual-property-policy">OSF copyright policy</a>. </p>
