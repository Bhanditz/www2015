<p>Nature Publishing Group (NPG) and Creative Commons are pleased to announce an ongoing agreement to support the work of Creative Commons (CC). NPG today pledges an annual donation to CC. This will be equivalent to $20 for every article processing charge (APC) paid for publication in any of the 20 journals owned by NPG with an open access option, up to a maximum of $100,000 a year.</p>
<p>â€œIt's imperative that those who contribute true value in the communication of the results of research have their rights protected while promoting access as far as possible,â€ says Philip Campbell, Editor-in-Chief of <em>Nature</em> and Nature Publishing Group. â€œCreative Commons is a key contributor to that ethos, and I am delighted that we at Nature Publishing Group will be adding our support in this way.â€</p>
<p>This builds on the announcement last week that NPG will make a donation to CC of $20 per APC for articles published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, its newest open access publication. NPG has kick-started its wider support with a donation of $15,560 to CCâ€™s current funding drive. This is equivalent to $20 per APC for all 778 open access papers published by NPG, from when it started offering open access publishing options to its authors in 2005, to the end of 2010.</p>
<p>â€œNPG is taking this step as part of our ongoing commitment to open access,â€ says Jason Wilde, Business Development Director at NPG. â€œWe feel that it is important to support the legal framework behind open access, particularly given that we and many other publishers rely on the work of CC to license open access content.â€</p>
<p>As of January 2011, NPG publishes 45 journals that have an open access option, or are entirely open access. Twenty are wholly owned by the publisher, and it is these journals that the CC agreement will apply to. For each APC paid on these journals, NPG will donate $20 to CC. NPG is currently in discussion with its academic and society partners, and with their agreement expects to expand the program to society-owned journals in the coming months.</p>
<p>â€œNPG's commitment to making knowledge available to share and build upon is commendable all on its own - I'm thrilled that the company is taking the innovative next step of financially supporting Creative Commons' work. CC's tools make sharing easy and legal, and NPG's support for what we do demonstrates that it is deeply dedicated to realizing the potential of open access.â€ commented Cathy Casserly, CEO, Creative Commons.</p>
<p>Authors of the research paper concerned will be eligible for complimentary membership of the CC network. Joining CC gives authors access to a network of other individuals who share a belief in the power of open systems to enhance innovation. Creating profiles on the CC network allows authors to expose their work to an international community of open access supporters and leading thinkers. To claim their membership, authors simply need to contact CC with the DOI of their article. This membership offer is retrospective, and open to all authors of every open access article published in NPG journals from 2005 to the end of 2010.</p>
<p>NPG now offers an open access option on 51% of its portfolio of 88 journals. In addition, NPG encourages self-archiving, in line with its license to publish, and offers a free manuscript deposition service to PubMed Central and UK PubMed Central on 43 titles. </p>
