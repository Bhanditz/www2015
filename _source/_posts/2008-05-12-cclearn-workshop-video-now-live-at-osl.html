<p>In April I blogged about <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/" target="_blank">Open Source Lab</a>'s fourth official workshop featuring ccLearn's Executive Director, Ahrash Bissell. The Open Source Lab has now posted a <a title="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/2008/05/12/video-of-cclearn-workshop-is-live/" href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/2008/05/12/video-of-cclearn-workshop-is-live/" target="_blank">video</a> of the workshop at their blog. The workshop focuses on recent developments within open education, including but not limited to the impact of open licensing, as Ahrash emphasizes the grander scale of the movement.</p>
