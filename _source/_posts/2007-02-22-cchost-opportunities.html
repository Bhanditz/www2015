<p>The open source remix community project  ccHost is proving to be more than an incubator for CC technologies; if you monitor the <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/cctools-cchost">developer's list</a> you can't help noticing the regularity of postings for job opportunities. The latest comes from Brett at <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/mixter.php">Open Source Cinema</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We're looking for a PHP programmer to help with our CChost install at OpenSourceCinema.org... What we are in need of is some customization of our templates, and a bit of work on a custom module we wrote to take advantage of the blip.tv API...We have a budget to spend on some development, if anyone is interested or knows of some good folks through their respective projects...we're trying to present our site at SXSW in about 2 weeks. :)</em>
