<p>Marco Raaphorst writes in about '3voor12 plundert musea' (this is an expanded version of an <a href="http://melodiefabriek.nl/2006/05/03/ableton-live-demo-voor-vpros-3voor12/">entry on his blog</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Dutch VPRO have asked me to compose a special song for the release<br />
party of '<a href="http://3voor12.vpro.nl/plundertmusea/">3voor12 plundert musea</a>'<br />
VPRO is a Dutch broadcasting<br />
organisation for national non-commercial TV and radio. They are payed by<br />
tax-money. Their <a href="http://3voor12.nl">3voor12.nl</a> is a site for music and<br />
music-video's (not specifically under CC licenses, sometimes embedded in<br />
a  Flash-player) as well as hosting several forums, news and interview<br />
pages.</p>
<p>This project '<a href="http://3voor12.vpro.nl/plundertmusea/">3voor12 plundert musea</a>'<br />
is based on <a href="http://3voor12.vpro.nl/plundertmusea/instruments/">high quality<br />
recorded samples</a> which are available under the Creative Commons<br />
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/nl/">Attribution 2.5 Netherlands</a> license. People who create a remix can decide which CC license they<br />
would like to choose, but only CC licenses can be chosen, so this is<br />
really interesting.</p>
<p>For this event, a release party of the first winners of the '3voor12<br />
plundert musea' contest, I will compose a special song. This song will<br />
be demonstrated by me using Ableton Live, showing you how you can tweak<br />
and mangle samples and create something new out of it.</p>
<p>The winners will receive 250 copies of their songs on vinyl!</p>
<p>Details: 16th of May at Studio 80, Amsterdam. Doors open at 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>I guess it will be fun; me, a laptop, a keyboard, a mic and a projector. Bjorn Wijers of Creative Commons Netherlands told me he'll be there too. Drinking<br />
beer and promoting Creative Commons...</p>
