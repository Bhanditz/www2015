<p><a href="http://radioscorpio.com/netwaves">Netwaves</a> is an <em>awesome</em> Creative Commons music program broadcast on Radio Scorpio 106FM, Belgium's oldest independent radio station. Announcements in Dutch, interviews conducted in English, music CC-licensed, drawn from the best of the netlabel scene. Every episode is <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/netwaves">downloadable from archive.org</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/nws013">Netwaves 13</a> features an interview with Lawrence Lessig.</p>

<p>I learned of Netwaves <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2007/01/bswc-one-day-obsibilo-soixante-8.html">bia Black Sweater White Cat</a>, which has added a pick of the day to their weekly CC music program broadcast on WBCR-LP in Massachusetts, which now follows BSWC with a Netwaves rebroadcast.</p>
<p>For even more great CC licensed music from the Dutch-speaking world, check out <a href="http://simuze.nl">Simuze.nl</a>, which recently surpassed <a href="http://www.simuze.nl/live/nieuws/?p=135">1000 tracks</a> and added a <a href="http://www.simuze.nl/live/nieuws/?p=131">dedicated Simuze stream</a>.</p>
