<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4483">As you know</a>, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">WIRED CD</a> was recently nominated for a Billboard Digital Entertainment Award in the category of "best use of technology by a music label." Neeru and I joined our WIRED counterparts this weekend in Los Angeles to attend the awards ceremony, where we learned that the CD did not take home the award.</p>
<p>It was an honor to be a finalist, and we salute the winner, <a href="http://www.defjam.com/llcoolj/home.las">LL Nation</a> by Island Def Jam.</p>
