<p>It appears that David Wiley's move to Brigham Young University has already resulted in progress towards opening the university's content. Long-time pioneer and academic of open education, Wiley <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/908">reports</a> that <a href="http://ce.byu.edu/is/site/courses/ocw/">BYU's Independent Study</a> has launched its Open CourseWare (OCW) pilot with six Creative Commons licensed courses under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY NC-SA</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The pilot includes three university-level courses and three high school-level courses (BYU IS offers 250 university-level courses online for credit and another 250 high school-level courses online for credit). The courses in BYU IS OCW are content-complete - that is, they are the full courses as delivered online without the need of additional textbooks or other materials (only graded assessments have been removed)."</p></blockquote>
<p>The most interesting thing about this pilot is that it "is part of a dissertation study to measure the impact of OCW courses on paying enrollments." So far, "the results are very positive - 85 of the 3500 people who visited the OCW site last month registered for for-credit courses... if this pattern remains stable, then BYU IS OCW will be financially self-sustainable with the ability to add and update a number of new courses to the collection each year, indefinitely, should they so choose." Echoing Wiley, that is an exciting prospect. We look forward to seeing these results develop, in addition to other inquiries into the sustainability of general OER initiatives in the future...</p>
