<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.tw/blog/">Creative Commons Taiwan</a> unveiled today <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/?jurisdiction=tw&amp;lang=zh_TW">Version 3.0 of its jurisdiction-specific licenses</a>. The six standard Creative Commons licenses are legally and linguistically adapted to Taiwanese law, making it easier for local creators to clearly signal the rights they wish their works to carry.</p>

<p>The launch was celebrated at the <a href="http://www.sinica.edu.tw/2009openhouse/">2009 Open House</a> of the <a href="http://www.sinica.edu.tw/">Academia Sinica</a>, the host institution of CC Taiwan. The team's Project Manager, Wen-Yin Chou, presented on "Brief Introduction of Creative Commons Licenses", while visitors to the information booth could watch <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos">CC videos</a>, take quizzes about the licenses, and talk with the CC Taiwan team throughout the day.</p>
