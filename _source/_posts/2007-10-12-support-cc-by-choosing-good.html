<p>To all of you CC supporters in Los Angeles -- there's a happening party tonight that you should check out. <a href="www.goodmagazine.com">Good Magazine</a> is throwing a party at the Natural History Museum (details: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/unknown1.jpg" title="unknown1.jpg">Good comes back to LA</a>) complete with an open bar and some awesome DJs.</p>
<p>The cover is the cost of a subscription ($20), which you can have donated to Creative Commons. This is the final week in which Creative Commons will be an official <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/choosegood/creativecommons">Choose Good Partner</a>. Over the past year 1430 people have subscribed to Good Magazine and chose CC as the the organization they would like their subscription fee to benefit. So if your in the LA area and are looking for something to do tonight, I urge you to take advantage of this final opportunity to support Creative Commons through Good Magazine's Choose Good Campaign.</p>
