<p>As we kicked off the Gregorian new year on Jan 1st, we also <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20003">celebrated</a> <a href="http://publicdomainday.org">Public Domain day</a> 2010. On that day, copyright protection expired for millions of works around the world and entered the public domain, which is "the wealth of information that is free from the barriers to access or reuse usually associated with copyright protection, either because it is free from any copyright protection or because the right holders have decided to remove these barriers." I like this second part best: "It is the raw material from which new knowledge is derived and new cultural works are created."</p>
<p>That definition comes from <a href="http://www.publicdomainmanifesto.org">The Public Domain Manifesto</a> which launches today and is a document that "outlines a series of general principles along with various issues relevant to today's Public Domain, and provides some recommendations aimed at protecting the Public Domain and ensuring that it can continue to function in a meaningful way-with particular relevance to education, cultural heritage and scientific research." The Public Domain Manifesto is spearheaded by <a href="http://communia-project.eu/">COMMUNIA</a>, the European Thematic Network on the Digital Public Domain. It opens with the principle that "The Public Domain is the rule, copyright protection is the exception" which states that "Since copyright protection is granted only with respect to original forms of expression, the vast majority of data, information and ideas produced worldwide at any given time belongs to the Public Domain." (For more information, see the <a href="http://www.communia-project.eu/node/359">press release</a> on COMMUNIA.)</p>
<p>Creative Commons is an original signatory of the manifesto, and has plans to contribute more to our work in this area. On Jan 1, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20003">highlighted</a> a few projects that we will dig into in addition to the CC0 waiver. </p>
