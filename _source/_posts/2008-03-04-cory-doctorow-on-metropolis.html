<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/24/remixable-german-doc.html">This hit the net last week</a>, but it took a little while for us to go through our various channels to figure out what was going on (i.e. if only I had taken German in high school). CC-evangelist <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> was recently interviewed on the German show <a href="http://www.arte.tv/de/kunst-musik/metropolis/103970.html">Metropolis</a> (a product of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arte">German-French network Arte</a>) in which they chat about his novel <em>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</em> (or <em>Backup</em>, as it is titled Germany) as well as "online freedom and surveillance, and science fiction". The whole thing is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/de/">CC licensed</a>, so it is available for reuse if you so desire.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/03/eastern-standard-tri-1.html">UPDATE</a></strong>: Cory's second novel, <a href="http://craphound.com/est/"><em>Eastern Standard Tribe</em></a>, has been published in German by <a href="http://www.randomhouse.de/heyne/">Heyne</a> (under the title <em>Upload</em>) with the text released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/de/">BY-NC-SA license</a>. Cory also recently did <a href="http://www.watchberlin.de/watchberlin/#watchberlin-content-9156-1-V">an interview about CC licensing and science fiction</a> with the German net-show WatchBerlin.</p>
