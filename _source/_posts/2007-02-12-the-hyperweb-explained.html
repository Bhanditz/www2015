<p>You've probably seen this <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE">video</a> already, or at least noticed that others have blogged it. I didn't get around to actually watching it until I noticed that <a href="http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/blog/manifestos/wesch.html">Eben Moglen broke five plus months of blog silence</a> to rave about it.</p>

<p>"Web 2.0 ... The Machine is Us/ing Us" by <a href="http://www.ksu.edu/sasw/anthro/wesch.htm">Michael Wesch</a> is licensed under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a>, explores CC-related themes, but you should watch it because it's a <strong>very</strong> well done work. Can't wait to see the final cut (this is the 2nd draft) -- and remixes.</p>
<p>The video is set to CC licensed music, as <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE">noted on YouTube</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The song is "There's Nothing Impossible" by Deus, available for free at <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/103/">http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/103/</a><br />
Deus offers music under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- ShareAlike 2.0 license, yet one more example of the interlinking of people sharing and collaborating this video is attempting to illustrate.</p></blockquote>
