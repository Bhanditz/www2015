<p>Brandon Wiley, an early developer of <a href="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/tiki-index.php?page=WhatIsFreenet">Freenet</a>, unveiled his newest work at CodeCon. Using various cutting-edge peer-to-peer technologies, he's developed a shared radio streaming system, dubbed <a href="http://tristero.sourceforge.net/alluvium/about.html">Alluvium</a>, that allows listeners to share their connections with others as they tune in. In <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/29436.html">a Register write-up</a> today, Wiley mentions that the project may include spidering the web for Creative Commons-licensed music to play (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/fullrights">all Creative Commons-licensed music can be webcast freely</a>).</p>
<p>Wiley will be on <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/panels/sunday/">a panel discussion</a> featuring Creative Commons executive director Glenn Otis Brown and Metadata Advisor Aaron Swartz at the upcoming <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSW</a> festival.</p>
