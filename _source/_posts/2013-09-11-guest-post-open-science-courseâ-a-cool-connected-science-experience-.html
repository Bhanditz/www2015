<p>Open Science Courseâ€”a cool connected science experience!<br />
by Michelle Sidler</p>
<p>This past August, I facilitated an online peer-learning course in the School of Open introducing Open Science to newcomers, and Michelle worked behind the scenes to keep things glued together. Â This guest post was written by Michelle, and gives a look at how things went teaching an entirely free course on Open Science over the web.</p>

<p>Guiding Students through the Course<br />
During last monthâ€™s round of School of Open courses<http: //schoolofopen.org>, I helped out with a facilitated version of the Open Science course supported by Creative Commons, the Open Knowledge Foundation, and PLOS. On four Tuesdays in August, Billy Meinke hosted online discussions with a handful of well-known members of the Open Science community while participants from around the world completed course modules and blogged about their experiences. Hereâ€™s how things went down.</p>
<p>Note: The course materials and online discussions are available on the Open Science P2PU course page [https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/], and will continue to grow over the next few weeks as participants share blog about their experiences working with aspects of science that are either open or not.</p>
<p>Participant Blogs<br />
While completing course units, participants blogged their experiences, offering reflections and insights about Open Science and sharing online resources they found. Participants were researchers and scientists from around the world, including biologists, climatologists, librarians, and even musicians.</p>

<p>Though we are still working through much of the blog posts, here are some examples of people learning about Open Access, Open Data, and Open Research for free through the School of Open:</p>
<p>The first of three modules introduced the topic of Open Access (OA), and after browsing through content about OA, learners were to report on the openness of published research articles they found on the web. Â A learner named Peter Desmet provided a fine overview of the history of open access and the different â€œflavoursâ€ of open access in an entry on his blog [link: http://peterdesmet.com/posts/oa-1.html]. Â Â The second module led folks to the topic of Open Data for science, where a peer by the name Odon shared her process of learning through her blog, Odonlife [link: https://odonlife.wordpress.com/]. Her writings offered definitions and descriptions of open data and assessed the openness of datasets she found online. Drawing from these lessons, she also described her experiences contributing to Open Data crowdsourcing projects and how they inspired her to start a similar project. Â For the third unit on Open Research, Nicki described the work of Jon Tennant, a paleontologist and Open Science advocate who deposited the data from his PhD research into the Paleontology Database, a repository for similar data. Jon even commented on her post, thanking her for the shout-outâ€”another example of the ways in which open information brings researchers together! </p>
<p>Featured Speakers<br />
In addition to supporting the online course participants, Billy Meinke hosted online discussions with many Open Science friends and advocates from many locales and types of involvement with science around the world. Â Guests from a variety of organizations joined open, broadcasted Google Hangouts and shared their experiences in Open Science with dozens of learners watching each stream. Â Thanks to all the guests who took the time to chat with us about Open Science! Â Links to the video and etherpad notes (taken during the live sessions) can be found on the Open Science course page.

<p>Taking the Open Science course further<br />
The Open Science course doesnâ€™t end when after we complete the units and assignments. Continue the conversation by spreading the word to other scientists about this resource and encouraging them to participate. There has been interest in volunteer translation efforts and other adaptations of the material. Anyone is free to do so, in compliance with the CC BY-SA license on the course. Â Much of the material is licensed CC BY or CC0, which give even more open reuse rights!</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to find out more about whatâ€™s happening with this course and others in the School of Open, head on over to the School of Open Google Group <https: //groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/school-of-open> and join the discussion! Â You can also sign up to be notified when the next facilitated course launches, likely in Spring 2014.<br />
