<p><b>San Francisco, California â€” July 12, 2006</b></p>
<p>Creative Commons is proud to announce today that it has been named as one of twelve non-profit organizations that will participate in the innovative subscription strategy â€” the <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/subscribe/">CHOOSE GOOD</a> campaign â€” that accompanies the launch of <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/">GOOD magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Launching nationwide this Fall, GOOD magazine strives to elevate the level of debate among its target demographic of intelligent, ambitious, youthful people aged 21 through 35. Founded by Ben Goldhirsh, GOOD is focused on the people, ideas, and institutions affecting change in the world. The magazine intends to examine the intersection of idealism and capitalism, and living well by doing â€œgoodâ€. GOOD will serve as a platform for talented contributors and writers to bring to the forefront issues and ideas that matter.</p>
<p>As part of the CHOOSE GOOD campaign, GOOD has chosen 12 charity organizations that represent issues and ideals that accord with GOODâ€™s mission. In addition to Creative Commons, CHOOSE GOOD partners also include Teach For America, Ashoka, Donors Choose, Witness, OCEANA, World Wildlife Fund, Millennium Promise, UNICEF, Room to Read, Generation Engage, and City Year.</p>
<p>A new subscriber to GOOD can elect to participate in the CHOOSE GOOD campaign by choosing one of the 12 charities as the recipient of a donation from GOOD for the entire amount of their $20 subscription fee. In the case of Creative Commons, GOODâ€™s aims to raise $60,000 in order to provide more than 20 international legal jurisdictions with the legal tools and technologies that allow them to more easily and efficiently distribute their creative works on the Internet.</p>
<p>GOOD magazine is also offering magazine contributors the option to CC license their contributions under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives license.</p>
<p>â€œWeâ€™re honored to have been selected as a CHOOSE GOOD partner and to be in the company of so many other great organizations,â€ said Francesca Rodriquez of Creative Commons. â€œCreative Commons hopes that our participation in the CHOOSE GOOD campaign will confirm our role as a key enabler of and contributor to topical debates.â€</p>
<p>â€œCreative Commons is a perfect example of the nature of programs and policies GOOD aims to highlight,â€ said Max Schorr, GOODâ€™s editor and publisher. â€œTheir particular initiative encourages creativity and more valuable content, which are vital aspects of our editorial and overall mission.â€</p>
