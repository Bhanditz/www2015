<p>Today Creative Commons launched the <a href="http://creativecommons.net">Creative Commons Network</a>, as part of their <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">annual fundraising campaign</a>. </p>
<p>The CC Network offers users a profile and web badge, providing a means to express support of Creative Commons.  The site also acts as a testbed for digital copyright registry technology. CC Network users may list their Creative Commons licensed works on their CC Network profile. The profile and web<br />
badge include metadata corresponding to the license used, allowing applications to consume information about the provenance of licensed works and licensors. Creative Commonsâ€™ own website is one such application and now displays provenance information on license web pages if available. </p>
<p>Creative Commons CTO Nathan Yergler said â€œThe CC Network is where the semantic rubber meets the web roadâ€, referring to the high expectations and underwhelming adoption of Semantic Web technologies. Yergler continued â€œWith the CC Network weâ€™re leveraging everything weâ€™ve learned over the past five years about metadata on the web, including the new RDFa standard, along with the work of many other groups, including FOAF, POWDER, and SIOC.â€ </p>
<p>CC Network accounts also come with an OpenID login, allowing users to login to sites that support OpenID via a trusted provider. The CC Network aims to raise the bar for OpenID providers by taking all steps necessary to protect usersâ€™ privacy. â€œAn OpenID provider knows every site a user logs into via OpenID, so it is important for a user to be able to trust their OpenID provider. We hope users think Creative Commons is trustworthy, but weâ€™re also taking steps to bake user protections into the CC Networkâ€™s OpenID provider implementation, from the technology to terms of service to explanation of the risks and benefits to usersâ€ said security expert Ben Adida, a technology advisor to Creative<br />
Commons. </p>
<p>All of the standards the CC Network builds on are open, and the code that runs the site is free software. â€œThe CC Network launch is a step toward a system of interoperable digital copyright registries as open as the web itself. Open registries allow users to discover more information about who's licensing content, and as such are a necessary complement to our open copyright licensesâ€ explained Creative Commons CEO Joi Ito.  </p>
<p>CC Network accounts are offered as a <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">benefit</a> for annual CC supporters at a level of $50 or above ($25 for students). Creative Commonsâ€™ annual fundraising campaign, themed â€œBuild the Commonsâ€, has a goal of raising $500,000 as well<br />
as encouraging CC supporters to lead by example, educate others about the value of the CC approach to openness and access, and to help launch the CC Network. </p>

<p>About Creative Commons </p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that<br />
promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned<br />
or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons<br />
offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range<br />
of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept<br />
of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach.<br />
Creative Commons was built with and is sustained by the generous support of<br />
organizations including the Center for the Public Domain, Omidyar Network,<br />
The Rockefeller Foundation, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur<br />
Foundation, and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, as well as<br />
members of the public. For more information about Creative Commons, visit<br />
