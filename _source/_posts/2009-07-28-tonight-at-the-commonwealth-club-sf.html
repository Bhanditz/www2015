<p>From the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/">Science Commons blog</a> ...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Commoners and digerati alike will come together tonight at the <a href="https://tickets.commonwealthclub.org/default.asp">Commonwealth Club</a> in San Francisco for a vibrant discussion on the intersection of science and the Web. The event, <a href="https://tickets.commonwealthclub.org/auto_choose_ga.asp?area=2&amp;shcode=1251">"Making the Web Work for Science"</a>, will be moderated by <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/tim/">Tim O'Reilly</a>, founder of <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a>, joined by panelists <a href="http://www.sagebase.org/sageleaders.html">Stephen Friend</a> (<a href="http://www.sagebase.org/index.html">Sage</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>), and our own <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/wilbanks/">John Wilbanks</a> (<a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a>).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The night will be dedicated to the idea of bringing Web efficiencies to scientific research - a core theme seen in our work and thinking here at Science Commons. We now have the tools and understanding to bring together open research and data on a global scale, embedded with the freedoms necessary to be able to fully utilize it. Come help us further discuss this concept with some of the top names in the Bay area tech community as well as open science advocates.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The event (<a href="https://tickets.commonwealthclub.org/auto_choose_ga.asp?area=2&amp;shcode=1251">currently sold out</a>, but stay tuned) kicks off at 6 p.m. with a networking reception; the main event beginning at 6:30. A private reception will follow. <a href="https://tickets.commonwealthclub.org/auto_choose_ga.asp?area=2&amp;shcode=1251">Tickets</a> are $8 for Commonwealth Club members, $15 for non-members, and $7 for students with valid ID.</p>
