<p>If you have only been reading the updates on the international Creative Commons blog (this one) about the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/Casestudies">Case Studies</a> project you have been missing some important news.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">Creative Commons Australia</a>, the leaders in the Case Study project, have just released the first draft version of the Case Studies book pdf: <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/materials/Building_an_Australasian_Commons_book.pdf">Building an Australasian Commons</a>.  This is one high quality book that show cases all of the Australian Case Studies.  A huge "<strong>Congrats!</strong>" goes to Rachel Cobcroft and everyone else who has put so much time into this project and produced such a wonderful tool for all to use.</p>

<p>If you like this book enough that you want to print your own copy, <strong>GO FOR IT!</strong>  However, for those of you that will want to print a large number of these my advice is to wait; there will be a newer more finalized version soon which will make some changes you will want.</p>
<p>Now, go add your own Case Studies to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/Casestudies">project wiki</a> so that the next version might have YOUR case study included!</p>
