<p>Barney Boomslang and Bibi Book have brought the  <a href="http://boomslang.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/avatar-chess/">game of chess</a> into the virtual world.  Play or watch on Thursday, November 16 at 4pm PST.  Find us at our usual spot on <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Kula%204/46/92/26/">Kula 4</a>.  Residents may sign up to participate in the 32-player game by wearing a chess piece outfit and moving across the board.  Join the "Avatar Chess" SL group, and contact Barney to play for the white team or Neit Tackleberry to compete on the red side. Timed moves will maintain the game pace.  Brush up on your chess strategy and tactics, or just take snapshots!</p>
