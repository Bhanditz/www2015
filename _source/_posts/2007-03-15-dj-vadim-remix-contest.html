<p>When Ben from the very cool indie label <a href="http://www.bbemusic.com/">BBE Music</a> got in touch with us and asked if we would be interested in a <a href="http://djvadim.com">DJ Vadim</a> remix contest at <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> we thought about it â€¦ <em>for about a half a millisecond</em>! You see, in the remixing/turntable world DJ Vadim is nothing short of a superstar and the fact that he  put the audio sources for two tracks into the Commons is cause for celebration. As Ben says it is "essential in this game not to sit back and wait for people to come to your music. As independents we need to work hard and get our music out there and heard."</p>
<p>Ben is encouraging not only producers but also rappers to get involved because the winning remix will be released on an upcoming BBE EP featuring DJ Vadim.</p>
<p>sooooâ€¦ we are proud, excited and generally freakin psyched to announce the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/djvadim">DJ Vadim â€œKill Kill Killâ€ â€œTalk to Meâ€ remix contest</a>.</p>
