<p>Most of Creative Commons staff is in Rio de Janiero this weekend for the iCommons iSummit.  See the <a href="http://www.icommons.org/isummit/">iSummit coverage</a> site for panel writeups, podcasts, and images from the conference.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to have a few days of face to face collaboration with our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/">worldwide affiliates</a> and extended community.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.icommons.org/isummit/report.php?rID=88">Participate online in Second Life</a>.</p>
