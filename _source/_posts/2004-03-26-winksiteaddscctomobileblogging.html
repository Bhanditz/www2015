<p><a href="http://winksite.com/">Winksite</a> is a popular mobile blogging application that lets you both post to a blog from your phone or PDA and read other blogs, in addition to a slew of other community tools. <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?blog_id=1208">They've recently added Creative Commons support</a> for blogs hosted on the service, so you can make it clear to readers how your content is licensed.</p>
