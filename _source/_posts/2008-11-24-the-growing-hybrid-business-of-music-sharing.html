<p>One of the things we've become very interested in finding more examples of are creators who are using our licenses in combination with traditional business models. For example, many musicians (including our recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10753">Commoner Letter author Jonathan Coulton</a>) sell copies of their CC-licensed music. This may seem cognitively dissonant but in practice it makes perfect sense, as a CC-licensed piece of music simply announces what you can do once you get your hands on it, and it certainly doesn't restrict the original creator from selling it to you.</p>
<p><a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/hawkshaw-ice/"><img class="alignleft" title="The Ice Castle" src="img/cover_160.jpg" alt="" /></a>Some of the most robust instances of this behavior are musicians who have released CC-licensed material on iTunes, Amazon, and <a href="http://www.magnatune.com">Magnatune</a>. Ambient Electronic artist <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/kirsty_hawkshaw">Kirsty Hawkshaw</a> has done this with her album <em><a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/hawkshaw-ice/">The Ice Castle</a></em>, which has a presence in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016CIRBK/ref=dm_sp_alb">all</a> <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/hawkshaw-ice/">three</a> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=277014648&amp;s=143441">stores</a>, but also indicates that is under CC's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license. In the cases of iTunes and Amazon, the stores themselves are not using the CC license, but are selling the work via the rights they have under their direct agreement with the copyright holders - Hawkshaw and her label, Magnatune. For more about how CC licenses can work in tandem with other agreements, visit our page that describes <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+</a>.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear and see more examples of this kind of hybrid business thinking utilizing our licenses. Do you know of any others? If so, just drop a comment on this post, or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contact">contact us</a> any other way. Thanks!</p>
