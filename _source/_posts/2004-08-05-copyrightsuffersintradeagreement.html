<a href="http://lawgeek.typepad.com/lawgeek/2004/02/australia_bows_.html">A recent trade agreement between Australia and the US</a> included a provision that extended Australia's copyright from 50 years after author death to 70 years, to match US Law. There was speculation that <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/">Project Gutenberg Australia</a> would suffer, and it looks like it officially has. Take a look at <a href="http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/lockout.php/verse/p1/oldissue.html">this list of authors</a> that were once available for public domain download in Australia, but no longer are. There are some amazing works in that list of authors, now locked up for two more decades.</p>
