Andy Raskin wrote a long, detailed piece about Creative Commons for the May 2004 issue of Business 2.0 magazine entitled "<a href="http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,608619,00.html">Giving It Away (for Fun and Profit)</a>." The thrust of the artice is a look at what the future landscape might look like for artists that license their work under Creative Commons. The article also talks about ways current artists are making money and what types of future economies might be built around the licensed work.</p>
