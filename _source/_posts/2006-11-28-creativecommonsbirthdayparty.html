<p><b>Creative Commons Turns Four!</b></p>
<p>Please join us on Friday, December 15, 2006, from 9pm until 2am, to celebrate Creative Commons' birthday!</p>
<p>Raise a glass and toast the four years that CC has worked to promote and enable a participatory culture. CC's big day is being hosted by the good people at <a href="http://songbirdnest.com">Songbird</a> â€“ the supercool open source media player that's taking the Web by storm.</p>
<p>Songbird is located at 777 Florida Street, Suite 300 in San Francisco, CA. The entrance is on 20th Street.</p>
<p>There will be an open bar, courtesy of Cooley Godward Kronish. There will also be a Special CC Birthday Brew, available for five dollars a bottle, courtesy of the "Free" Beer guys of <a href="http://www.superflex.net/">Superflex</a>.</p>
<p>Music will be provided by DJs Aus, Deckard, and Oonce Oonce.</p>
<p>Since we're in the midst of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support">annual fundraising campaign</a>, we'll be asking for a small donation at the door. Please contribute whatever you can to show that you support CC's work.</p>
