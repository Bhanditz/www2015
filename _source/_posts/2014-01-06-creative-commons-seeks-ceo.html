<p>You might remember <a href="/weblog/entry/39874">our announcement a few months ago</a> that Cathy Casserly will be stepping down as CEO of Creative Commons this year. Today, we're excited to officially open the search for the new CEO. Our friends at <a href="http://www.moppenheim.com/active-searches-items/creative-commons-chief-executive-officer/">m/Oppenheim Associates</a> are helping to coordinate the search.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moppenheim.com/active-searches-items/creative-commons-chief-executive-officer/">From m/Oppenheim's announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creative Commons is at an inflection point in its history. In the coming years, CC will pursue strategies that expand use of its licenses and promote a robust knowledge-sharing ecosystem. The organization recognizes that many paths lay open for pursuing these objectives, and the search for a new chief executive offers an opportunity to explore new ideas for services, products, advocacy, policies and programs. The new leader will oversee continued stewardship of CC's licenses and also seek new opportunities to expand knowledge-sharing through the internet.</p></blockquote>
