<p>One-man band <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/">Brad Sucks</a> recently <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/brad_sucks">signed with Magnatune</a> and licensed all his tracks under Creative Commons (and began selling them on a sliding scale on <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune's site</a>).</p>
<p>We were delighted to hear that Brad's song "<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/music/Rock/Brad%20Sucks/I%20Dont%20Know%20What%20Im%20Doing/01-Making%20Me%20Nervous-Brad%20Sucks.mp3">Making Me Nervous</a>" was recently licensed for use in <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000444.php">radio ads</a> and <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000436.php">TV ads</a> that played in Canada. Thanks in part to <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/license/?artist=Brad+Sucks&amp;album=I+Dont+Know+What+Im+Doing&amp;genre=Rock">Magnatune's tiered licensing system</a>, record-at-home musicians like Brad have found other ways to make a living from their music by selling commercial licenses. It's a great example of the common sense approach Magnatune takes to commercial licensing that also allows for free sharing and listening by fans. Congrats, Brad and Magnatune!</p>
