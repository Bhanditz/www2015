<p><a href="http://www.eugenia.co.uk/">Eugenia Loli-Queru</a> recently published a <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/20575/Guide_to_Creative_Commons_Media_for_Videographers"><strong>Guide to Creative Commons Media for Videographers</strong></a>, providing a great overview of what videographers should look for in CC-licensed media. Lol-Queru gives background on our license conditions (explaining what each one means for videographers in particular), discusses <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Audio#Featured_Audio_Sites">sources for CC-licensed music</a>, and touches on some general practices and marking standards videographers should abide by. It is a solid guide for anyone looking for free and open media to use in online video and something all CC-using videographers would do well to read.</p>
