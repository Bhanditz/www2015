<div style="float:right; padding:10px"> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/us_open_data_action_plan.pdf"><img src="img/us-open-data-action-plan.png" alt="us open data action plan" width="200" height="258" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42644" /></a></div>
<p>Today the White House released the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/05/09/continued-progress-and-plans-open-government-data">U.S. Open Data Action Plan</a>, reaffirming their belief that â€œfreely available data from the U.S. Government is an important national resourceâ€¦ [and] making information about government operations more readily available and useful is also core to the promise of a more efficient and transparent government.â€ The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/us_open_data_action_plan.pdf">report</a> (PDF) outlines the commitments to making government data more accessible and useful, and documents how U.S. federal agencies are sharing government information. From a legal standpoint, some agencies have decided to place their datasets into the worldwide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a> using the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>. This means that all copyright and related rights to the data are waived, so it may be used by anyone--for any purpose--anywhere in the world--without having to ask permission in advance--and even without needing to give attribution to the author of the data. </p>
<p>Use of CC0 for U.S. government works has always been a challenging topic for federal agencies. This is due to the hybrid nature of copyright for government works under <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105">Section 105</a> of U.S. copyright law. That statute guarantees that U.S. government works do not receive copyright protection--they are in the public domain. However, while these works are not granted copyright protection inside the U.S., the <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:H.R._Rep._No._94-1476_(1976)_Page_059.djvu">legislative history</a> of the law notes that the works may receive copyright protection outside of U.S. borders: </p>
<blockquote><p>The prohibition on copyright protection for United States Government works is not intended to have any effect on protection of these works abroad. Works of the governments of most other countries are copyrighted. There are no valid policy reasons for denying such protection to United States Government works in foreign countries, or for precluding the Government from making licenses for the use of its works abroad.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Historically, the U.S. government has been apprehensive to apply CC0 to federal government works, because the CC0 Public Domain Dedication is a tool to waive copyright and neighboring rights <em>globally</em>. At the same time, itâ€™s clear that many high-value U.S. government datasets, such as the weather data produced by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are being widely (and freely) used by meteorological and research organizations around the world. It seems that in the vast majority of cases, the U.S. federal government doesnâ€™t wish to leverage its copyrights abroad. So perhaps it makes sense to simply clarify that these works will be made available in the worldwide public domain using a standard tool such as CC0. While we had some <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/38316">initial questions</a> about acceptable licenses for federal government information, it seems that agencies are moving in the right direction in utilizing the public domain dedication, as opposed to the other copyright licensing tools that were laid out in <a href="https://project-open-data.github.io/license-examples/">Project Open Data</a>. </p>
<p>In addition to showcasing federal agencies that are using CC0 on some of the datasets itâ€™s releasing, the U.S. Open Data Action Plan document itself is also published under CC0. </p>
<blockquote><p>As a work of the United States Government, this document is in the public domain within the United States. Additionally, the United States Government waives copyright and related rights in this work worldwide through the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the last several years, many have called upon the federal government to adopt CC0 for U.S. government works. Most recently, a  group of advocates drafted <a href="http://theunitedstates.io/licensing/">recommendations</a> urging federal agencies to release federal government works, contractor-produced works, and primary legal materials into the into the worldwide public domain under CC0. Todayâ€™s announcement is a move in the right direction for data re-users in the United States and beyond.</p>
