<p>In recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/5476">news</a> - <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/home/index.jsp">openDemocracy.net</a> has announced that it is releasing the articles of around 150 of its existing authors under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license and will also be incorporating the option of Creative Commons licensing for all future contributors.</p>
<p>openDemocracy is an online magazine that provides a forum in which global issues relating to politics and culture are debated, many of which do not receive sufficient or sufficiently careful attention by the mainstream media. A brief review of openDemocracy's <a href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/about/about_od_contributors.jsp">author pages</a> shows that recent authors have included Kofi Annan, Timothy Garton Ash, Janis Ian, Iris Marion Young, Salman Rushdie, George Soros, Richard Stallman and Gillian Slovo.</p>
<p>It is great to have such a high caliber publication committed to the principles of spreading ideas around the globe and adopting a Creative Commons to fulfill that objective. You can read more about their decision to switch and why Salman Rushdie said no to a Creative Commons license in our recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/opendemocracy">Featured Commoner segment</a>.</p>
