<p>Here's a great idea: A <a href="http://www.learcenter.org/html/projects/?cm=ccc/fashion">conference</a> that compares how creativity is regulated in fashion versus how it's regulated in other art forms. In fashion, copyright (among other things) is pretty laissez-faire compared to, say, music or film.</p>
<blockquote><p>On January 29, 2005, the Norman Lear Center will hold a landmark event on fashion and the ownership of creativity. Ready to Share will explore the fashion industry's enthusiastic embrace of sampling, appropriation and borrowed inspiration, core components of every creative process. Presented by theÂ Lear Center's Creativity, Commerce & CultureÂ project, and sponsored byÂ The Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising/FIDM, Â thisÂ groundbreaking conferenceÂ willÂ feature scholarly debate, fashion shows, multimedia presentations,Â the clash of perspectives and the cross-fertilization of ideas.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're in Los Angeles this weekend, come see designer Tom Ford, musician Dangermouse, techie John Seely Brown, musician and producer T-Bone Burnett, and other giants of the various corners of the creative world talk about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5171">the fine art of sampling</a>, across disciplines.</p>
<p>Or, check out the <a href="http://onlineg2.usc.edu:8080/ramgen/encoder/live.rm">webcast</a> at 9am PST January 29.</p>
