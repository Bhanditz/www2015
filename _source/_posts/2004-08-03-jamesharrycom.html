<p>With the advent of various <a href="http://news.google.com/">news</a> <a href="http://newsbot.msnbc.msn.com/">gathering</a> <a href="http://www.newsisfree.com/">services</a>, there's been a recent trend to produce visualizations to make sense of the information deluge. So far I've seen <a href="http://www.marumushi.com/apps/newsmap/">this flash representation of Google News</a>, <a href="http://www.newsisfree.com/newsmap/">a Java representation of NewsIsFree</a>, and <a href="http://news.stamen.com/">this interesting timeline-based topic view</a> of Google News, also in flash.</p>
<p>A completely different view on the news is provided each week on <a href="http://www.jamesharry.com/">JamesHarry.com</a>. "What happens is the news" is an obsessive hand-drawn summary of the past week's noteworthy events. <a href="http://jamesharry.com/archive.html">It's been around since the beginning of this year</a>, and it's fun to go back and remember the topics that grabbed headlines. The images are under a fairly open Creative Commons license, meaning you can take these images and do quite a bit with them. </p>
