<p><i>In honor of <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons&#8217; tenth anniversary</a>, we&#8217;re profiling several media platforms with CC integration. <a href="http://vimeo.com/creativecommons">Vimeo has supported CC licensing since 2010</a>, and has accumulated over two million CC-licensed videos. When I spoke with <a href="http://vimeo.com/blakewhitman">VP of creative development Blake Whitman</a>, he told me that Vimeo&#8217;s staff and community had been talking about CC for years prior. "We knew that this would be perfect for the type of community that Vimeo has. There&#8217;s a lot of remixing going on, and it made a lot of sense for us to incorporate it. We thought it was a great web standard that needed to be solidified in our space."</i></p>
<p><i>I also asked Blake to recommend some of his favorite CC-licensed videos on Vimeo. Two of those are embedded in this interview; the rest are listed below.</i></p>
<p><strong>Tell me more about how CC licensing fits into the Vimeo community.</strong></p>
<p>The beginnings of Vimeo were really about sharing and collaboration, doing projects together, and sharing life&#8217;s moments. It&#8217;s evolved over time - as we added HD and other featured that attract higher-end creators - but that ethos has always stayed the same. We&#8217;ve always given users the option to make their vidoes available for download. It&#8217;s important that when people make their content available for download, there&#8217;s a clear way for the creator to indicate how they&#8217;d like that content to be used.</p>
<p>For a long time, we didn&#8217;t have that. You could make it explicit in the description that there was a CC license on it, but since it wasn&#8217;t built into Vimeo, it wasn&#8217;t being used consistently. When people download videos, they should know what the rights are that the creators are intending.</p>

<p><strong>How much did you publicize the CC implementation? Were there any hiccups or pushback from the community?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s always a period of learning for anything new, but we work very hard to make it clear. It&#8217;s crucial that people understand how the licenses work - and not just for videos. I want users to understand CC licensing on a deeper level, as a part of sharing on the Internet at large.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that Creative Commons has changed the Vimeo community&#8217;s attitudes about sharing?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always changing and evolving, as smaller communities within Vimeo expand and contract and branch out.</p>
<p>People are open willing to share, and CC is a model that makes sense. Look how many people are allowing their content to be used for commercial purposes. And that&#8217;s pretty amazing, that people are that open to allow for people to make money from the stuff that they create, as long as they&#8217;re cited. That&#8217;s great, and I think it&#8217;s really important.</p>
