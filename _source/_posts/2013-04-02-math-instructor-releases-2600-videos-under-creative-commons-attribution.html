<p>Arizona Phoenix College math instructor James Sousa has been teaching math for 15 years at both the community college and K-12 levels. Over the years, he has developed more than 2,600 video tutorials on topics from arithmetic to calculus, and made these videos available on YouTube, originally under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> license. His website and videos, entitled, <a href="http://mathispower4u.yolasite.com/">Mathispower4u</a>, feature both math lessons and examples, and many of the videos have been incorporated into online homework questions available at <a href="http://www.myopenmath.com/">MyOpenMath.com</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, James decided to change the license on his videos from CC BY-NC-SA to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, or Creative Commons Attribution. He writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Originally, the videos were licensed CC BY-NC-SA. However, the reason for creating these videos was to help students be more successful in mathematics. To increase student access and more easily share this resource with others, I decided to make the videos more open and change the license to CC BY. I hope the videos will provide a quality math tutorial resource to many."</p></blockquote>
<p>Mathispower4u videos may be accessed in several ways, including through James' <a href="http://mathispower4u.yolasite.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://mathispower4u.wordpress.com/">blog</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/user/bullcleo1">YouTube account</a>, and Phoenix College's <a href="http://phoenixcollege.edu/mathvideos">video database</a>. Thanks to James for his great contribution to open education and the field of mathematics!</p>
