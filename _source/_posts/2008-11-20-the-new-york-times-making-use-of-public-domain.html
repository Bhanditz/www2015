<p>In yesterday's Personal Tech Q&amp;A section of <em>The New York Times</em>, there was a useful item called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/technology/personaltech/20askk-001.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">Making Use of Public Domain</a> (registration required, although I was able to see the page at first without logging in) that describes a bit about how images that are found online can be used. The article points to a few good sources of public domain images and also mentions Creative Commons-licensed works as a source of legal-to-use material.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just because a photo or document is available online does not mean it is automatically in the public domain, so check for copyright notices or a Creative Commons license before grabbing something to reuse. (A Creative Commons license works alongside a copyright and allows writers and artists more flexibility in sharing their creations with the world â€¦)</p></blockquote>
