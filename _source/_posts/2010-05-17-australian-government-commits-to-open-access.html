<p>Earlier this month, the Australian federal government issued an official response to the <a href="http://gov2.net.au/report/">Government 2.0 Taskforce report</a> which recommended, among other things, that Australian Public Sector Information (PSI) should be released under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY </a>as default. The <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/295">response</a> (licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY</a>) included a commitment to the development of a comprehensive set of IP guidelines which would, in principle, follow the Gov 2.0 Taskforce recommendations. Via <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/295">CC Australia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regarding the Gov 2.0 Recommendations 6.3-6.6, which state that Creative Commons Attribution (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY</a>) should be the default licence for PSI, the report provides "agreement in principle," undertaking that the IP Guidelines will not "impede the default open licensing position proposed in recommendation 6.3."</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then, Australia has released three major government publications under Creative Commons licenses, the latest being their <a href="http://www.budget.gov.au/2010-11/content/bp1/html/bp1_prelims.htm">national budget</a> under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, the last week has seen the release of three major Federal Government reports - the Budget, the Gov 2.0 response and the NBN Implementation Study - all under CC licences. This seems to be a great indicator that the government really means what it says - open access is going to be the default position for the Australian Federal Government from now on.</p></blockquote>
<p>This marks an exciting time for the Australian government, as they move towards fulfilling their commitment to openness. For more information, see CC Australia's <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/297">post</a> on the matter.</p>
