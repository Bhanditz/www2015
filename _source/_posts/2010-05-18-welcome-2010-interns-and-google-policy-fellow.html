<p>Creative Commons is once again preparing to welcome a new batch of summer interns and another <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/05/2010-class-of-google-policy-fellows.html">Google Policy Fellow</a>. This year, three students will be working alongside the staff in the San Francisco office for ten weeks. Reginald Leones and Alessandra Garbagnati were chosen for the legal internship positions.
