<p>The Florida chapter of <a href="http://www.freeculture.org/">Free Culture</a> made their presence known at the <a href="http://www.law.ufl.edu/">University of Florida Law School's</a> Music Law Conference.  They wrote about the experience <a href="http://ffc.berthall.com/2005/02/12/music-law-conference-2005/">here on their blog</a>, and also made a remarkable visual display which can only speak for itself. The photos were taken by Gavin Baker:
