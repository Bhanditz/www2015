<p>Have you gotten your favorite dad a gift for Father's Day yet? We've collected a few of our favorites. There's bound to be something in this list for every father in your life, no matter whether he's into classical music or experimental poetry. Those are the two main things dads like, right?</p>
<p>If you buy these (or anything) at Amazon and you're in the US, then <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/ch/04-3585301">consider supporting Creative Commons through AmazonSmile</a>. If you make a purchase between now and Sunday, then CC will receive $5, in addition to our cut of the purchase.</p>

<h3><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008XGZZL2/creatcommo09-20/ref=nosim/">Kimiko Ishizaka, <em>The Goldberg Variations</em></a></h3>
<p><a href="/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a></p>
<p>Ishizaka's excellent performance showed up on numerous best-of-the-year lists in 2012. It's also in the public domain under CC0, meaning that anyone can use it for any purpose, commercial or noncommercial, with or without attribution. <a href="http://teamopen.cc/thomas/">When we interviewed Thomas Bonte about his involvement with the Open Goldberg Variations project</a>, he said, "You either go all the way or you don't do it. Kimiko wanted her work to be used by a lot of artists. And yeah, mission accomplished."</p>
<h3><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0615612652/creatcommo09-20/ref=nosim/">Thomas Meyer, <em>Beowulf</em></a></h3>
<p><a href="/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 3.0</a></p>
<p>"<a href="https://jacket2.org/commentary/thomas-meyer-%E2%80%93-beowulf-translation-fit-nine">Every translation I'd read felt impenetrable to me</a> with its block after block of nearly uniform lines," Meyer writes. His translation of the ancient epic is many things - a gorgeous reimagining of how works from an oral tradition can look and behave on paper, an idiosyncratic melding of epic and experimental poetry - but it is stubbornly <em>not</em> block after block of uniform lines.</p>
<h3><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446576441/creatcommo09-20/ref=nosim/">Lawrence Lessig, <em>Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress - and a Plan to Stop It</em></a></h3>
<p><a href="/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC 3.0</a></p>
<p>In the year and a half since its publication, the CC co-founder's book on money in politics has sparked a major, national discussion on how wealthy contributors influence politicians and policies on both sides of the aisle. You could also consider making a donation in Dad's honor to <a href="https://mayday.us/">MAYDAY.US</a>, Larry's SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs.</p>
<h3><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0615314465/creatcommo09-20/ref=nosim/">Randall Munroe, <em>xkcd volume 0</em></a></h3>
<p><a href="/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">CC BY-NC 2.5</a></p>
<p>The first collection of the best geek comic out there. There's something for everyone in this volume, whether they're a lover, a gamer or a mathematician. There's even something for us copyright geeks, with the complete adventures of Doctorow, Lessig, et al in their complete superhero garb. <em>Review by Jessica Coates</em></p>
