<p>Creative Commons is thrilled to announce that we will be reviving CC salons on a quarterly basis starting March 27!</p>
<p>Years ago, CC ran a series of CC Salon events in the Bay Area, informal events that brought together creators of all kinds to talk about how and why they choose open in their fields. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC salons continue to occur all over the world</a>, but on March 27, CC will host a salon on social justice and open innovation right here in San Francisco.</p>
<p>This informal event will feature short talks from guests in local nonprofits and the free culture community, as well as lots of interesting people to network and socialize with. It's free and open to everyone.</p>
