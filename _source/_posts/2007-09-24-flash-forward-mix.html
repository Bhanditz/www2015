<p>There is <a href="http://gratisvibes.com/post/the-flash-forward-2007-singapore-mix/ ">a great mix of CC-licensed electronic</a> over at <a href="http://gratisvibes.com">Gratisvibes</a>, an amazing music blog based solely around CC-licensed electronic music. The mix itself stems from the <a href="http://icommons.org/blogs/flash-forward-singapore-21-aug-2007">Flash Forward Party</a> in Singapore, part of iCommns' <a href="http://icommons.org/nodes/heather-and-jimmys-50-great-parties-club">50 Great Parties Club</a>. From <a href="http://gratisvibes.com/post/the-flash-forward-2007-singapore-mix/ ">GratisVibes:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Well, itâ€™s been a week but finally the guys (DJ FU, CT and I) who did the Flash Forward dj gig last week have managed to churn out the mp3 mix of the whole set. Lasting about 50 minutes, this mix contains a broad selection of tracks that we have reviewed before at Gratisvibes. Also included in the mix are several new tracks from The Electronic Music Lab, Singapore mainly to give the whole gig last week a dash of local flavour.</p></blockquote>
