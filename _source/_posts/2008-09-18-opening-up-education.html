<p>is the new publication by the <a href="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/">Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> and MIT Press exploring "the potential of open education to transform the economics and ecology of education."Â <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11309">Opening Up Education:Â The Collective Advancement of Education through Open Technology, Open Content, and Open Knowledge</a>Â is a collection of thirty essays written by leaders in the open education movement. From the press release:</p>
<p>"<em>[They]Â reflect on current and past open education initiatives, offer </em><span class="bodycopy"><em>critical analyses, </em></span><em>share the strategic underpinnings of their own work, </em><span class="bodycopy"><em>and </em></span><em>delve into open educationâ€™s implications in three areas: technology, content, and knowledge.</em><span><em> Together, they address the central question of how open education </em></span><span class="bodycopy"><em>can improve the quality of education</em></span><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>Co-editorÂ M. S. Vijay Kumar is also quoted:</p>
<p>â€œ<em>A look at the landscape tells us that efforts with open education so far have been largely confined to attempts at improving what we already do.Â While this is certainly valid, we encourage consideration of approaches that transcend traditional practices, organizations, disciplines and audiences.</em>â€Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">John Seely Brown agrees in his Foreword, â€œWe need to reconceptualize twentieth-century education models, and at the same time reinforce learning outside of formal schooling. This book provides real leverage for open education, and is a major step toward creating a culture of learning for this century.â€</p>
<p>The book is also edited by Toru Iiyoshi and is available for <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/opening_up_education/">download</a> at MIT Press under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>.</p>
