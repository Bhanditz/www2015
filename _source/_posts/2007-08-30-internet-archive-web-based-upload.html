<p>The <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a> has been the most important repository of Creative Commons licensed media since Creative Commons launched over 4 1/2 years ago. However, their <code>ftp</code>-based upload was a barrier to those unfamiliar with that pre-web technology and the Internet Archive's upload workflow. A small price to pay for otherwise free access to the repository most likely to make your work available forever--that's the point. And using <code>ftp</code> made sense, as the Internet Archive wants to keep the highest quality files possible -- that means huge files, and web-based upload was not up to that task.</p>
<p>CC wanted to make the Internet Archive more accessible to artists, so we created <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher">ccPublisher</a>, which hid <code>ftp</code> and most of the workflow complexity, making upload a drag and drop operation. This was imperfect, as it required artists to install a desktop application and Creative Commons to maintain a cross platform desktop application requiring network access, which takes a lot of work to do well across the many versions and configurations of Windows, Mac, and Linux in widespread use -- and the developer (Nathan Yergler, now our CTO) could only dedicate a fraction of his time to the project.</p>
<p>Through some combination of factors--perhaps more robust file upload code in browsers, on the server side, and wider deployment of broadband -- web-based upload for fairly large files now works well. So the Internet Archive has rolled out a <a href="http://www.archive.org/create/">web-based uploader at archive.org/create</a>. It doesn't look all that interesting, but actually is very important -- it dramatically lowers the barrier for artists who want their work to be part of the permanent record of free culture. Of course choosing a Creative Commons license is a built-in part of the uploader.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.archive.org/create/">upload away</a>! The Internet Archive still recommends <code>ftp</code> or ccPublisher for files over 100MB, but that barrier will fall eventually as well.</p>
