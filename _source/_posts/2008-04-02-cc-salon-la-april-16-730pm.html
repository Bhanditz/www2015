<p>Heads up to all LA based CC-heads - two weeks from today, April 16 at 7:30 PM, we are back at <a href="http://www.foundla.com/sys/">FOUND LA</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1903+Hyperion+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90027,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">Google Map</a>) for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Los_Angeles_Salon">another CC Salon</a>. We've revamped our approach, focusing more on content creators and the issues they face and to say we are excited about the lineup would be an understatement.</p>
<p><a href="http://rexbruce.com/">Rex Bruce</a>, director of the <a href="http://www.lacda.com/">Los Angeles Center for Digital Art</a>, will be screening a video he directed that uses public domain imagery from the US Military (also playing at the <a href="http://www.centrepompidou.fr/Pompidou/Accueil.nsf/tunnel?OpenForm">Centre Pompidou</a>). <a href="http://www.hollywillis.com/">Holly Willis</a>, Director of Academic Programs at the <a href="http://iml.usc.edu/">Institute for Multimedia Literacy</a>, will be presenting on art in Second Life, focusing on creators who are cognizant of the formal and ideological implications of virtual worlds. </p>
<p>Jack Lerner, Acting Director at the <a href="http://law.usc.edu/academics/clinical/ip.cfm">USC Intellectual Property and Technology Law Clinic</a>, will give a talk on research he has been conducting in relation to music sampling that looks at defects in the market and proposes changes. Finally, we will be joined by multimedia designers <a href="http://www.weisbart.net/">Chris Weisbart</a> and Michael Wilson who will explain how they are using open source technology in museums and will give a live demonstration of a holographic projection system they've recently built into an interactive exhibit.</p>
<p>Phew! All the presenters of course will touch upon the interaction their various topics play with CC licensing. So come out and join us for what is bound to be an eye opening night, and yes, there will be free (as in beer) drinks.</p>
