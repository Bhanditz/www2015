<p><a href="http://www.neweducationhighway.org/">New Education Highway</a> (NEH) is a nonprofit project that could not exist without open educational resources (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/education#OER">OER</a>). Launched this year in Myanmar, NEH leverages new and existing OER to provide remote and rural communities -- often with no Internet connection -- with access to a quality education.</p>
<p>NEH partners with existing organizations in local communities to open free learning centers with tablets or laptops installed with an offline, easily navigable learning interface. Resources are preloaded and span all manner of subjects, including comprehensive K-12 education, standardized test preparation, vocational skills, health/HIV education, sanitation, critical thinking, community development, foreign language training, and environmental and agricultural science. All resources are available under CC licenses, developed by NEH or other organizations. Because permissions have already been granted for reuse, NEH, as well as its communities, can adapt and redistribute the resources as needed.</p>
<p>NEH works with each community it serves to customize the offline interface and OER to that particular community. NEH is always seeking new and existing materials to incorporate, currently in the environmental and agricultural sciences. If you have suggestions for OER, materials that might be adapted and released as OER, or are interested in getting involved as a volunteer, visit <a href="http://www.neweducationhighway.org/">http://www.neweducationhighway.org/</a> or email <a href="mailto:info@neweducationhighway.org">info@neweducationhighway.org</a>.</p>
