<p>This time last year I had the pleasure of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10665">announcing</a> Ebay as a new corporate supporter. Today, I'm delighted to announce that they've decided to continue their support of Creative Commons -- investing in the future of creativity and knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="http://ebay.com">Ebay</a> makes for a natural CC supporter, since the company upholds the same values as we do -- connecting people and ideas, as well as encouraging sharing, collaboration, and innovation. If you hold the same values, please consider <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">joining Ebay and supporting CC today</a>. We are only as strong as our community of supporters, and we need your help -- <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate today</a>!</p>
