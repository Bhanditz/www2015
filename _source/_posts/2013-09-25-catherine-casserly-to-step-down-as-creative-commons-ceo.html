<p><strong>Mountain View, CA, September 25, 2013:</strong> Catherine Casserly announced that she will transition out of her role as CEO of Creative Commons in early 2014. Creative Commons, a Silicon Valley nonprofit that provides legal and technological tools for sharing and collaboration, was launched in 2002. Casserly became the organization&#8217;s first full-time CEO in 2011 after serving on the board of directors. Casserly helped to secure the organization&#8217;s considerable gains from its first decade and to lay a foundation for its second. She worked with the board and staff to integrate and grow existing programs, increase public impact, articulate key priorities and outcomes, and strengthen core operations.</p>
<p>One of Casserly&#8217;s significant accomplishments was Creative Commons&#8217; role in the development of open education policies, both in the United States and around the world. In 2012 alone, the governments of Poland and California passed major legislation in support of open educational resources (OER) and others, like British Columbia, provided major public funding for OER. Similarly, the US Department of Labor is currently awarding $2 billion in grants for OER development through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) grant program.</p>
<p>In an email to Creative Commons&#8217; global network of volunteers, Casserly expressed pride in three years of growth as a movement and optimism about the possibilities for the organization&#8217;s new leadership. &#8220;Together, we&#8217;ve grown our community and movement tremendously&#160;&#8212; both in size and in our ability to impact the world. For me and for the organization, the three-year mark is the right time to usher in a new generation of leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creative Commons board chair Paul Brest noted that Cathy&#8217;s tenure as CEO has brought major changes to the organization. &#8220;The focus that we&#8217;ve seen over the past three years is remarkable, and what&#8217;s even more impressive is the clarity of mission and priorities that Cathy has brought to the organization. Under her leadership, the growth in the use of CC licenses generally, in the field of OER, and particularly in government-adopted OER mandates, has brought us substantially closer to our vision&#160;&#8212; universal access to knowledge and culture&#160;&#8212; than ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Casserly agreed, and predicted that the next CEO will play a major role in scaling Creative Commons&#8217; achievements. &#8220;We&#8217;re currently developing products and tools with the potential to transform how sharing and collaboration work on the internet. Realizing that potential will require a CEO who deeply understands both our mission and the broader technology landscape.&#8221; The Creative Commons Board of Directors plans to formally begin the search for a new CEO in October.</p>
