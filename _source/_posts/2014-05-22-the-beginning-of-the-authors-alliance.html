<p>Yesterday marked the launch of the <a href="https://authorsalliance.org">Authors Alliance</a>, a nonprofit organization that supports authors who want â€œto harness the potential of digital networks to share their creations more broadly in order to serve the public good.â€</p>
<p>In an interview with Publisherâ€™s Weekly, Authors Alliance founder Pamela Samuelson <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/62270-founder-of-just-launched-authors-alliance-talks-to-pw.html">explained</a> that the Authors Alliance will have a few different roles. Inwardly, the group will â€œprovide authors with information about copyrights, licensing agreements, alternative contract terms,â€ and other practical legal information so that they can make their works widely and openly available. And externally, the Alliance will â€œrepresent the interests of authors who want to make their works more widely available in public policy debates,â€ and advocate for these reforms alongside like-minded public interest organizations.</p>
<p>The Authors Alliance was developed by Samuelson and several of her colleagues at the University of California Berkeley including Molly Van Houweling, Carla Hesse, and Thomas Leonard. The Alliance also has an <a href="http://www.authorsalliance.org/about/">advisory board</a> made up of pre-eminent scholars, writers, and public interest advocates, including several members of the Creative Commons board of directors. The Authors Alliance is <a href="https://www.authorsalliance.org/a2-join/">now accepting new members</a>. </p>
<p>The Alliance has already developed a set of <a href="http://www.authorsalliance.org/principles-and-proposals-for-copyright-reform/">copyright reform principles</a>, outlining its vision for changes to copyright law to support authors who write to be read.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have formed an Authors Alliance to represent authors who create to be read, to be seen, and to be heard. We believe that these authors have not been well served by misguided efforts to strengthen copyright. These efforts have failed to provide meaningful financial returns to most authors, while instead unacceptably compromising the preservation of our own intellectual legacies and our ability to tap our collective cultural heritage. We want to harness the potential of global digital networks to share knowledge and products of the imagination as broadly as possible. We aim to amplify the voices of authors and creators in all media who write and create not only for pay, but above all to make their discoveries, ideas, and creations accessible to the broadest possible audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>The principles include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Further empower authors to disseminate their works.</li>
<li>Improve information flows about copyright ownership.</li>
<li>Affirm the vitality of limits on copyright that enable us to do our work and reach our audiences.</li>
<li>Ensure that copyrightâ€™s remedies and enforcement mechanisms protect our interests.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the core, the Authors Alliance and Creative Commons share a similar goal: to provide useful resources and tools for creators who arenâ€™t being served well by the existing copyright system. Weâ€™re excited to work with the Alliance on issues that support authors who write to be read--and the public interest for whom these authors create. </p>
