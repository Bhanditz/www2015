<p>The <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/podcast/2009/sep/15/0x16/">Software Freedom Law Show, Episode 0x16</a> contains numerous bits of interest to CC geeks and is well worth a listen. The show's hosts, Karen Sandler and Bradley Kuhn of the <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Law Center</a>, discuss among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the GFDL turned out suboptimally -- a key point is that developing good public licenses is very hard, the the GFDL was one of the very first for software documentation or other non-software works.
</li>
<li>The migration of Wikipedia and sister projects from GFDL to CC BY-SA, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411">successfully completed this June</a>.
</li>
<li>The importance of public license stewardship by mission-driven nonprofits -- Bradley Kuhn's writing on stewardship has been <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11544">noted previously on this blog</a>.
</li>
<li>The license used for the show itself, which is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/">CC BY-ND</a>.
</li>
<li>A promise to talk about the public domain and specifically <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> in a future episode. Looking forward to it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>One quick addendum to the show, in which the hosts wonder if CC has a public versioning process. The answer is yes -- see a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#Summary_of_Links">a list of CC blog posts over the course of development of our 3.0 licenses</a>. The next, eventual versioning will be even more public and rigorous, just as the GPLv3 had a development process far more in depth than that of any public software license that preceded it.</p>
