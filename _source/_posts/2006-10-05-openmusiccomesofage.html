<p>In December of 2003 <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a> recording artist <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/debenedictis">Lisa Debendictis</a> released an album called <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/debenedictis-fruitless/">Fruitless</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license with an original composition and performance called "Brilliant Day" (<a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/debenedictis-fruitless/01.m3u">stream here</a>).</p>
<p>In March of 2004 John at Magnatune was encouraging me to get in touch with artists on the label to remix and Lisa was gracious enough to let me re-record her solo vocals to "Brilliant Day" so I could use as source material for remixing for what became <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/fourstones-chronic/">Chronic Dreams</a>.</p>
<p>In November of 2004 at the launch of Creative Common's remix community site <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> it was a no-brainer to release the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/lisadb/65">a cappella</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial</a> license. The a cappella track has since become one of the most remixed tracks on the site. </p>
<p>In July of 2005, a remix, also under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial</a>, was posted by ccMixter star <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/beatgorilla">Pat Chilla the Beat Gorilla</a> called "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/beatgorilla/1838">Brilliant Daze (days are confused)</a>" that, as of this writing, is one of the few tracks on the site with a perfect 5.0 rating.</p>
<p>One year later, in July of 2006 <a href="http://www.myspace.com/patchillathebeatgorilla">Pat's myspace page</a>, <a href="http://www.lisadebenedictis.com/">Lisa's website</a> and user registration at ccMixter were starting to flood with questions and praise for Lisa and Pat. It seems the "Brilliant Daze" remix was picked up by a teenage girl making videos in her bedroom, lamenting her restrictive parents and gushing over her boyfriend not as background music, but as the basis for a music video. In accordance with the Attribution clause of the license the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRO4JP81HPo">video posted to YouTube</a> was accompanied with full credits and links to Pat at ccMixter and Lisa's web site (click on 'more') and a large percent of the 100,000s of viewers were moved to follow up.</p>
<p>It is now over 450,000 views later and though it has since been revealed as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing">viral marketing</a> campaign,  one thing that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonelygirl15">lonelygirl15</a> phenomenon does prove, once and for all, is that by opening up music, allowing everybody to share and musicians to derive and collaborate the result <i>will touch a huge audience</i>.</p>
<p>Is CC licensed music viable? Half a million downloads can't be wrong.</p>
<p>Recently the inventors of lonelygirl15, in accordance with the NonCommercial clause of the license have been in touch with the musicians to <a href="http://lisadebenedictis.com/?p=101">work out payments</a> for use of the work in a commercial setting. Congratulations to Pat and Lisa.</p>
