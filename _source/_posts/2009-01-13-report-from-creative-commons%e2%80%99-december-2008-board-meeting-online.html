<p>CC CEO Joi Ito <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2009/01/14/summary-of-dece.html">notes</a> that we've just <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Board_Reports/2008-12">posted a summary of CC's December 2008 board meeting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Highlights included the CC Network, progress with the Free Software Foundation with respect to CC and the GFDL, CC0, integration with additional tools such as Picasa, the "Defining Noncommercial" study, partnership with the Eurasian Foundation, the fall fund-raising campaign, website updates, updates from Science Commons and ccLearn and the launch of four new jurisdictions - Romania, Hong Kong, Guatemala and Singapore.</p></blockquote>
