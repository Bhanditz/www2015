<p>CERSA (Research Center in Administrative Science) will lead the license translation and work to expand global access to French culture.</p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, USA; Paris, FRANCE; Tokyo, JAPAN</strong> &mdash; Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative works free for copying and re-use, announced today the expansion of its International Commons (iCommons) project to France. CERSA, a French research center dedicated to administrative sciences, will lead the effort.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to have CERSA lead iCommons in France," said Lawrence Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford, from Tokyo, where he is promoting Creative Commons' international projects this week. "France is the latest country to join our most exciting project &mdash; to build an international cultural commons."</p>
<p>"We are glad to host iCommons and to propose user-friendly, alternative licensing terms to authors. Our research group shares Creative Commons' vision to associate digital code and legal code," said Melanie Dulong de Rosnay, project lead of iCommons in France. Jean-Baptiste Soufron, co-project lead of iCommons in France, added: "We are very pleased to introduce the French version of the Creative Commons licenses. It was interesting not only to translate them, but also to adapt the licenses for full compatibility with our legal system."</p>
<p>Announced in March 2003, iCommons is Creative Commons' project to make its machine-readable copyright licenses useful worldwide. As the lead institution, CERSA will co-ordinate a public effort to adapt the Creative Commons licenses for use in France. CERSA will field comments on an archived email discussion at the Creative Commons website.

<p>France joins Brazil, Italy, Ireland, Finland, Japan, China, and Taiwan in the iCommons effort.</p>
