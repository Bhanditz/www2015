<p>Creative Commons Australia has just <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/unlockingthepotential">published an amazing 65 page report</a> on the use and potential of CC licenses in various sectors of the Australian economy, government, and media.</p>
<blockquote><p>In November 2006, the <a href="http://www.cci.edu.au">Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation</a> (CCi), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au">Queensland University of Technology</a>, hosted the CCau Industry Forum, a research-focused industry engagement event. The event was run by the CCi <a href="http://www.cci.edu.au/ccc">ccClinic</a> and <a href="http://www.cci.edu.au/ccr">CC + OCL Research</a> projects, and aimed to evaluate understanding of and attitudes towards copyright, OCL and CC in Australia. The Forum focused on the government, education and the creative industries sectors.</p>
<p><i>Unlocking the Potential Through Creative Commons: An Industry Engagement and Action Agenda</i> evaluates and responds to the outcomes of this Forum and presents a strategy for continued research into Creative Commons in Australia.</p>
