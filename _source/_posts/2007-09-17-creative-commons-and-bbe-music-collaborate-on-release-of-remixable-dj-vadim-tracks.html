<p>San Francisco, CA â€” September 18, 2007</p>
<p>Creative Commons and BBE Music are proud to announce the release of the original studio tracks from the album The Sound Catcher by DJ Vadim. The separated, solo instrumental and vocal tracks from the entire album are available for free and legal downloading and remixing. All are available online through Creative Commons' remix site ccMixter and are licensed to the public under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 license.</p>
<p>DJ Vadim is widely recognized as one of the world's premier DJs and producers. He has performed in virtually every country in Europe, all over North America, Australia, New Zealand. Japan, Israel, Turkey, South America, and South East Asia in just the last year. He has also performed with the likes of DJ Krush, Company Flow, The Roots, The Pharcyde, Public Enemy, The Beat Junkies, Dilated Peoples, and Kraftwerk. He has supported Super Furry Animals, Morcheeba, and Paul Weller, and has performed at events like Glastonbury and the Moscow Street Ball festival (to over 60,000 people).</p>
<p>The Sound Catcher is Vadimâ€™s latest album and was released on BBE Records earlier this year, at which time ccMixter held a remix contest with two of the albumâ€™s tracks. The contest was such success for everybody involved that BBE and ccMixter decided to team up for the long term. The release of the rest of the The Sound Catcher tracks marks the first major milestone in that relationship.</p>
<p>"Tracks from many of our new releases and back-catalogue are being uploaded to ccMixter," said BBE Musicâ€™s Ben Dawson in a message to the ccMixter community. "We know how well you all produce and we want to see what will happen! BBE has been releasing music for nearly 11 years now and the artists we have worked for include J Dilla, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Will I Am, Cut Chemist and lots more. It has been a beautiful thing to see producers at the beginning of their careers or established artists coming through the label and releasing their music through us. We believe in music and its power to unite, and this is why we have teamed up with ccMixter â€” to involve as many people as possible in the music and to seek the finest emerging talent out there."</p>
<p>Victor Stone, project lead of ccMixter, refers to the relationship as one based on mutual respect. "DJ Vadim and BBE Records have already proven their leadership in terms of artistry. Taking the bold step of releasing all of The Sound Catcher's tracks under a Creative Commons license shows they are willing to lead in an even broader cultural context. We've all been predicting this type of event as inevitable, yet as the day arrives it's still a thrill to see it become reality."</p>

<p>About BBE</p>
<p>BBE Records was an outgrowth of the Barely Breaking Even movement over<br />
10 years ago when Peter Adarkwah and his partner Ben Dawson were discussing music and discovered a shared interest in diverse, eclectic sounds covering all genres - from old scratchy Brazilian grooves, through 70's funk, via jazz fusion, hip - hop and soul to newer garage, disco and techno music. Today BBE is a major force in the DJ community. Learn more: http://www.bbemusic.com.</p>
