<p>I am thrilled to <a href="/weblog/entry/42690">welcome Ryan Merkley</a> as the incoming CEO of Creative Commons.</p>
<p>This is an important moment in the history of the organization. After eleven years, CC licenses are globally recognized as the definitive tool for sharing creative works. Millions across the world use CC as a force for good in their communities. We are building universal access to knowledge and culture as we had hoped&#160;&#8212; within the freedoms we craft inside copyright.</p>
<p>But the web has changed, and its users with it. And CC must too. I am excited and incredibly pleased that Ryan has agreed to join CC as the leader to take CC into its next era.</p>
<p>Ryan is an outstanding and recognized voice among Mozilla's global community. From his time there he has proven that he is a strong believer in the open web, open data, and open content, and he knows how to activate and motivate community members for change. He is a leader with a great technical vision informed by the right values. He has inspired all of us, and I am confident he will be the leader CC needs.</p>
<p>At the last Creative Commons Global Summit in Buenos Aires, someone asked me how I'd like to see the organization change.</p>
<p>My answer was simple: We celebrate the tremendous achievement of Version 4.0 of our Creative Commons licenses. But we are still at Version 2.0 of the technology that we use to deliver those licenses.</p>
<p>Ryan will fix that, and give CC another decade of incredible growth and remarkable success. We are grateful he has agreed to share his enormous talents with us.</p>
