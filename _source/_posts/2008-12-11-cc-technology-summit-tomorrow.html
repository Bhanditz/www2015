<p>We're holding the second Creative Commons Technology Summit tomorrow in Cambridge, MA.Â  The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12#Program">program</a> is online and I'm quite excited about the lineup.Â  We still have some space available so if you're in the area and would like to attend, drop by the Stata Center at MIT tomorrow morning and register on site.  The cost is $75 ($50 for CC Network members) or $40 for students ($20 for CC Network members).</p>
<p>If you can't make the event, fear not; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#104">Frank</a> will be pseudo-live-blogging the event over on the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/">CC Labs blog</a> and we'll have video available afterwards.</p>
