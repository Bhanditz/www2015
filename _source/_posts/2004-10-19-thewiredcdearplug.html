<p>I forgot to blog this last week when a friend pointed me to it: online music mag <a href="http://www.earplug.cc/mailer/issue33/index.html">Earplug's current issue</a> blurbs the forthcoming <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">WIRED CD</a> and November issue. A taste of the punchy and deliciously accurate write-up:</p>
<p>
<blockquote> The Creative Commons license is not a free-for-all: some of the artists permit only non-commercial sampling and sharing while others are open to all potential uses (with the exception of advertising placement). But the point Creative Commons makes is that there's a difference between "all rights reserved" and "some rights reserved" â€” especially in the digital age â€” and artists should be free to make these decisions about their work for themselves.</p></blockquote>
