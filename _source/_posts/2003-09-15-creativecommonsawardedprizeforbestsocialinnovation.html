<p>We've just learned that the <a href="http://www.alberyfoundation.org/">Institute for Social Inventions</a> (UK) has named our licensing project the Best Social Innovation in 2003 in the Communications Category.</p>
<p>The Institute is an educational charity founded in 1985. Its patrons include Brian Eno, Anita Roddick, and Fay Weldon.</p>
<p>We'll pass on details as we learn more.</p>
