<p><a href="http://intoinfinity.org/">Into Infinity</a> (see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8998">previous post</a>) - the CC-licensed art and music exhibition produced by <a href="http://dublab.com/">dublab</a> in collaboration with Creative Commons - is going strong. Visit the project's online home for regular additions by artists and musicians from all over the world. Everything on the site is offered under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial</a> license that allows legal sharing and reuse - we've already seen some great remixes of the works, which we're looking forward to presenting publicly soon.</p>
<p>For now, we're pleased to announce the debut of the <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/mixer">Into Infinity Audio Mega-Mixer</a>, a soundboard that lets you create in-the-moment sound collages from all of Into Infinity's 8-second audio loops. We'll be adding more functionality and updates to the mixer soon - so stay tuned. In the meantime, have fun creating sound combinations!<a href="http://intoinfinity.org/mixer" target="_blank"></a></p>
