<p>
At our first anniversary <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3928">party</a> Sunday night, we unveiled a new movie called <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/reticulum_rex/">Reticulum Rex</a>. For those of you that missed the event, the movie can now be seen <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/reticulum_rex/">here</a>, and it acts as a continuation of the story started in our first short, <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/getcreative/">Get Creative</a>.</p>
<p>
A big thanks to everyone that attended the party, supported us throughout the past year, and a special thanks to <a href="http://www.junell.net/">Ryan Junell</a>, <a href="http://www.christopherlydon.org/">Christopher Lydon</a>, and <a href="http://yourlight.org/">Benjamen Walker</a> for their incredible work in creating Reticulum Rex.</p>
