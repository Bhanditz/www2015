<p>San Francisco, US, & London, UK, 1st August 2005â€”<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.werenotafraid.com">www.werennotafraid.com</a> (WNA) today announced a landmark partnership whereby WNA will incorporate Creative Commons licensing into the WNA site, upcoming Proud Gallery exhibit and the â€˜Weâ€™re Not Afraidâ€™ book. By using the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 license, people around the world will be able to legally copy, redistribute and adapt the images that are made available (provided that they make any adaptations available under the same license terms).</p>
<p>â€œBy joining with Creative Commons, Weâ€™re Not Afraid is able to give anyone in the world access to the incredible, ever-growing content that makes up the site. So far we have more than 6000 images online and more than 25,000 waiting to be added to the site, as well as numerous songs, poems, movies, and statements that have been submitted by our visitors sharing their own artistic representations on terrorism in the world,â€ said Alfie Dennen, WNA founder. â€œWith a Creative Commons license, we can give the world this amazing resource without risking the rights of its creators.â€</p>
<p>WNA developed as an offshoot of MoblogUK, Europeâ€™s most successful moblogging site and the site responsible for posting the first ever images of the devastating effects of the 7th July London train bombings.</p>
<p>To date, <a href="http://www.werenotafraid.com">www.werenotafraid.com</a> has received more than 25,000 image submissions as well as countless multimedia submissions including music, video, and written pieces all of which are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-Sharelike 2.0 license.</p>
<p>The world community has been contributing a diverse range of content to the site; images showing personal views of the events such as:</p>

<p>As well as original and quality recordings such as this track, by Chris and John Mendelsohn:</p>

<p>Since its inception, the site has had over 20 million hits.</p>
<p>Based on the web site, the WNA Exhibition at Proud Central will launch on the 8th of September 2005 and will present a complete picture of terrorism and its effects. From stark images of terror-ravaged areas ranging from New York to Bali, to the fearless, inspired creations of WNAâ€™s visitors, the exhibit will promote the unity of a global community that defies religion, colour, creed, or country. Through the use of Creative Commons licensing on many of the images included in the Exhibition, visitors will be able to request images from the exhibition to be delivered digitally free of charge.</p>
<p>Currently in the planning stages, the â€˜Weâ€™re Not Afraidâ€™ book will be a collection of the most representative images submitted to <a href="http://www.werenotafraid.com">www.werenotafraid.com</a>. interspersed with texts taken from the worldâ€™s religious and philosophical works. With its book, WNA intends to show that no matter our beliefs or backgrounds, we are all one people who need only be given a voice to be united. All images and original works used in the book will be made available using Creative Commons licensing.</p>
