<p>The Center for Open and Sustainable Learning (<a href="http://cosl.usu.edu/">COSL</a>) has been hosting an OER Handbook on <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_Handbook">WikiEducator</a> for a while now, inviting others to contribute and edit various elements of the book. Now they've finally published the first printable version of one of their mini-handbooks: <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/3597933">OER Handbook for Educators 1.0</a>.Â </p>
<p>The actual handbook isn't so mini---though it weighs nothing at all in the virtual world, the printed version is a hefty 269+ pages. But you don't have to print it out; you can access it in various forms for free on the web: as it currently exists on <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_Handbook/educator_version_one">WikiEducator</a> or as <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/3597933">black and white</a> or <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/3692829">full color</a> pdf's on Lulu.com.Â </p>
<p>The OER Handbook for Educators is the collaborative result of various contributors, ultimately authored by Seth Gurell and edited by <a href="http://davidwiley.org/">David Wiley</a>. Its aim is to serve as an introductory guide to educators on open educational resources: how to "find, use, develop and share OER to enhance their effectiveness online and in the classroom." The handbook is an especial eye-opener for those new to the world of open education. However, it is also useful for more seasoned OER creators and users, grappling with such topics as "The Copyright Paradox"---because we all know that copyright is no simple matter.Â </p>
<p>The handbook itself is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, so go check it out! If your connection is slow, don't worry: the black and white graphics are just as stunning as their full color counterparts.</p>
