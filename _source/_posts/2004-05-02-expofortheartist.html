<p>Creative Commons spent the day at <a href="http://www.artsandmedia.net/expo/">Expo for the Artist</a>, the 5th annual gathering of artists, nonprofits, and community organizations at Cellspace, in San Francisco, USA. Celebrating its fifth year, the catch-all event included free workshops on grantwriting, burlesque, painting, self-publishing, navigating the music industry, metalworking, and more. Watch the <a href="http://www.artsandmedia.net/expo/">Expo website</a> for a series of DIY articles on these and other subjects.</p>
