<p>Today the University of California (UC) Academic Senate announced the adoption of a <a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/openaccesspolicy/">system-wide open access policy</a> for future research articles generated by UC faculty. The articles will be made publicly available for free via UC's <a href="http://www.escholarship.org/">eScholarship</a> repository. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/open_access_press_release_2013.pdf">press release</a>, the University of California open access policy will cover 8,000 faculty who author approximately 40,000 articles each year. From the UC statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>By granting a license to the University of California prior to any contractual arrangement with publishers, faculty members can now make their research widely and publicly available, re-use it for various purposes, or modify it for future research publications. Previously, publishers had sole control of the distribution of these articles.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears that authors will have the option of depositing their articles under open licenses, such as Creative Commons licenses. The <a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/openaccesspolicy/2013_uc_oa_policy_faq.html#q17">FAQ</a> says, </p>
<blockquote><p>Uses of the article are governed by the copyright license under which it is distributed, and faculty authors choose which license to use at the point of deposit. Faculty members may choose to restrict commercial re-use by choosing a Creative Commons license with a "Non Commercial" (NC) restriction when they deposit their article; or they may choose to allow it by choosing a license like the "Attribution only" license (CC BY). If no license is specified, a non-commercial license will be used by default.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Faculty are also able to <a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/openaccesspolicy/2013_uc_oa_policy_faq.html#q7">opt-out</a> of the policy on a per-article basis, which may <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1413">limit the effectiveness</a> of the policy overall if opt-outs become commonplace.    </p>
<p>The UC policy builds on existing open access policies in California, such as the one at <a href="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/services/scholpub/oa/policy">UCSF</a>. Here's a <a href="http://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/openaccesspolicy/OpenAccess_adopted_072413.pdf">link</a> the full text of the policy. Congratulations to UC for passing this policy, and we hope that faculty will embrace sharing research articles under open licenses. </p>
