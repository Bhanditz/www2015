<p>This week we're featuring <a href="http://www.vanderwoning.ca/gallery/">the photography of Raymond A. vanderWoning</a>. His photos feature subjects from flowers and bugs to signs and people and <a href="http://www.vanderwoning.ca/about.html">his about page</a> carries a thoughtful piece on how and why he licenses all his photos. A hobbyist photographer at heart, Raymond's closing statement gets to the heart of it all:</p>
<blockquote><p>Information doesn't want to be <em>free</em>, it wants to be <em>shared</em>.</p></blockquote>
