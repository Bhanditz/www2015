<p>We're thrilled to announce our new <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants">Catalyst Grants program</a>! We are investing up to $100,000 (via grants ranging from $1,000-$10,000) to provide seed funding to projects around the world devoted to increasing access and openness.</p>
<p>Our goal is to empower CC affiliates and other groups working to make knowledge easily, freely, and legally available to everyone, and we are especially interested in proposals that will help such projects scale their efforts and become more self-sustainable. The application deadline is June 30th. You will find more information and the application <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants">here</a>. </p>
<p>From June 1-30, we'll be raising $100,000 to seed the Catalyst Grants program. Your support will greatly enhance CC's reach and impact. Please take this opportunity to be one of the first to <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">support this important initiative</a>, all you need to do is put Catalyst Campaign in the comment box when you <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate</a>. Thanks in advance for your support!</p>
