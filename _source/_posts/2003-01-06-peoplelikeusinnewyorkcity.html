<p>UK-based media artist (and Creative Commons license adopter) <a href="http://peoplelikeus.org">People Like Us</a> will perform in New York City this week.  On January 8th, People Like Us (a.k.a. Vicki Bennett) will screen the intriguingly titled "We Edit Life" at <a href="http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/7085374/">Subtonic</a>.  On the 12th from 5pm to 7pm EST, People Like Us will hit the airwaves with WFMU, available at 90.1 or 91.1 on your dial or via webcast at WFMU's <a href="http://wfmu.org">site</a>.</p>
<p>Creative Commons had the honor of featuring People Like Us at our recent license release party in San Francisco.  <a href="http://www.peoplelikeus.org/dnload.htm">Check out</a> the works People Like Us has already released under Creative Commons licenses.</p>
