<p><strong>CREATIVE COMMONS ANNOUNCES PLEDGES MADE TO FULFILL â€œ5x5â€ FUNDING CHALLENGE</strong><br />
Pledges include promises of support from the Hewlett Foundation, Omidyar Network, Google, Mozilla, Red Hat, and the Creative Commons board</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco, CA, USA â€” January 2, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Today, Creative Commons announced that pledges have been made to meet the Hewlett Foundationâ€™s â€œ5x5â€ funding challenge to Creative Commons. The 5x5 challenge, issued in honor of Creative Commonsâ€™ fifth birthday, called for the organization to find five funders to each promise five years of support at $500,000 per year.</p>
<p>In addition to the Hewlett Foundation, Creative Commons received pledges of $500,000 in yearly support for five years from Omidyar Network, as well as from an anonymous European trust. Google has pledged $300,000 in support renewable for five years, while Mozilla and Red Hat have each pledged to contribute $100,000 annually for five years.</p>
<p>The final block of support comes from the board of Creative Commons, which has promised to personally raise or contribute $500,000 to the organization annually for five years.</p>
<p>â€œI couldnâ€™t be more pleased to make this announcement,â€ said Lawrence Lessig, CEO of Creative Commons. â€œThe generous support of these foundations, companies, and individuals ensures that Creative Commons will be able to continue working to build and support a freer culture for years to come. I cannot express how fortunate we feel to have the backing of this wonderful community.â€</p>
<p>â€œOmidyar Network is thrilled to support Creative Commons in its efforts to develop a copyright system that values flexibility, innovation, and protection for both content creators and users,â€ said Will Fitzpatrick, Corporate Counsel of Omidyar Network. â€œWe believe that there needs to be a simple way for people to legally and freely access, share, and use information, and that Creative Commons' efforts are crucial to reaching this goal.â€</p>
<p>â€œGoogle is proud to support Creative Commons and its mission of offering authors, artists, scientists, and educators open and flexible ways to make their creative works widely available,â€ said Kent Walker, Google's General Counsel. â€œAt Google, we help people find, organize, and share information. Creative Commons plays an important role in facilitating the legal and creative re-use of much of this great content.â€</p>
<p>â€œMozilla is excited to support the work of Creative Commons with our 5x5 pledge,â€ said Mitchell Baker, Chair of the Mozilla Foundation. â€œCreative Commons has empowered people everywhere to help build a participatory Web by making it easy to share as well as protect oneâ€™s creative work.â€</p>
<p>â€œRed Hat's dream to act as a force for democratizing content and the mission of Creative Commons are a natural fit for each other,â€ said Max Spevack, Fedora Project Leader. â€œRed Hat hopes that this can be one of many opportunities to support Creative Commons in the coming years.â€</p>
