<p>You've got to hear this. This week's featured content is exactly the sort of innovative co-authorship that Creative Commons, and good folks like <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/features/opsound">Opsound</a>, make possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.activefreemedia.org/people/">Colin Mutchler</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>About a month after submitting a few acoustic guitar tracks to<br />
<a href="http://www.opsound.org">Opsound</a>'s <a href="http://opsound.org/opsound/pool/mutchler.html">sound pool</a> [and thus releasing the song under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license], I got an email from a violinist named Cora Beth, who had added a violin track to one of the guitar tracks, "<a href="http://www.activefreemedia.com/gallery/music/colin/my_life.mp3">My Life</a>."  She called it "<a href="http://www.activefreemedia.com/gallery/music/colin/my_life_changed.mp3">My Life Changed</a>," and I think the track is definitely more beautiful now.  Maybe eventually we'll add drums and words.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is collaboration across space and time, as our <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org">Flash movie</a> puts it -- with no rights-clearing needed. Great stuff. We'd love to hear more of this sort of thing, so <a href="mailto:info@creativecommons.org">tell us</a> if you have a similar story.</p>
