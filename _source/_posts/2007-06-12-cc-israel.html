<p>Concluding <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7529" title="Creative Commons &gt; CC Bulgaria">our series</a> on the Creative Commons international jurisdiction projects comes news from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/il/" title="Creative Commons &gt; CC Israel">CC Israel</a> (CC-IL) concerning their various projects and initiatives. Again, we can't thank you all enough for your support during our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7447" title="Creative Commons &gt; Scholarship Campaign">CCi Scholarship campaign</a>  - it was  a truly overwhelming response and promises to make <a href="http://icommons.org/isummit-07/">iSummit 2007</a> an event for the ages.</p>
<p>CC-IL was established in 2004, when Ohad Mayblum, then an Israeli LLM student at Stanford University, worked as a research assistant to Professor Lawrence Lessig. At Stanford, Mayblum learned about Creative Commons and suggested that an Israeli branch should be established at the <a href="http://law.haifa.ac.il/events/event_sites/se/">Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology </a>(HCLT) - HCLT Directors, Professor Niva Elkinâ€“Koren and Dr. Michael D. Birnhack, agreed. The first CC-IL project leaders were Mayblum and Elad Wieder and as of November 2006, Nethaniel Davidi and Lital Leichtag have taken over, while Mayblum is responsible for legal assistance.</p>
<p>In January of 2007, CC-IL completed localizing the CC 2.5 licenses. Although some of the license adopters (about 23,000 works use CC-IL) have yet to upgrade their old CC licenses to the latest version, CC-IL are in the process of locating those users and are encouraging them to both adopt the new licenses and take an active part in their local community.</p>
<p>Similarly, since last January, CC-IL have been vigorously updating <a href="http://creativecommons.org.il" title="CC-IL Homepage">their website</a> in an attempt to make it more attractive, dynamic and up to date. CC-IL use their website to chart their progress, their projects with other organizations and, mainly, to post about local events. CC-IL has also begun featuring Israeli websites that use CC licenses on a monthly basis, creating a better connection between the authors and the community while giving the authors a sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>The main goal for CC-IL in 2007 is to increase awareness of CC licensing options among Israeli authors, artists, and creative minds. By the end of the year, CC-IL intend to launch an Israeli version of <a href="http://ccmixter.org/" title="ccMixter">ccMixter</a>, complete in Hebrew and supported by a generous grant received from the <a href="http://gip.isoc.org.il/" title="Israeli Information Society">Israeli Information Society</a> (ISOC-IL). ISOC-IL joins the "<a href="http://www.hamakor.org.il/index.html" title="Hamakor - Hebrew">Hamakor</a>" (<a href="http://www.hamakor.org.il/english.html" title="Hamakor - English">English</a>) association ("The Source" in Hebrew) in supporting CC-ILâ€™s goal for localizing CC applications (ccPublisher and ccHost) so that Israelis can easily use the applications with ease.</p>
<p>In order to promote CC's mission, CC-IL are in the process of producing a few short films in order to increase awareness of the importance of CC licenses. CC-IL also plan on having a small conference in the coming weeks, at which CC-IL will discuss the Israeli licenses and their different uses, presented by interesting guests that have been able to use them in different ways. CC-IL are also hoping to throw the first CC Israel party, coinciding with the launch of the new ccMixter Israel website.</p>
<p>Most of CC-ILâ€™s activities and projects are covered by the media, especially in dominant Israeli news websites like <a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3371279,00.html">ynet.com</a>, <a href="http://www.themarker.com//">themarker.com</a>, <a href="http://www.walla.co.il/">walla.co.il</a>, <a href="http://net.nana.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=433713">nana.co.il</a> and <a href="http://www.nrg.co.il/online/10/ART1/580/170.html">more</a>. In addition, former Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7441">has adopted a CC-IL license</a> for the contents of his blog. Netanyahu's use of CC comes at the time that the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) is discussing a new Copyright Act, and is a powerful statement from such a high profile politician.</p>
