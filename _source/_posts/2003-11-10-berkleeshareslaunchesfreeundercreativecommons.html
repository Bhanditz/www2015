<p><a href="http://www.berklee.edu">Berklee College of Music</a>, the world's largest independent music college and the premier institution for the study of contemporary music, today launched <a href="http://www.berkleeshares.com">Berklee Shares</a>, a groundbreaking new program that offers music lessons -- free under Creative Commons licenses -- and encourages musicians to share and distribute the lessons online. Berklee Shares consist of a growing catalog of MP3s, QuickTime movies, and PDF files derived from curriculum developed at the college by its world-renowned faculty. The lessons are available for download right now at the Berklee <a href="http://www.berkleeshares.com">site</a>, affiliate partner sites, and peer-to-peer networks, including Limewire.</p>
<p>Just a few highlights:</p>
<p>--For students of songwriting, a close <a href="http://www.berkleeshares.com/songwriting__arranging/tomorrow_never_knows_lennon_music_analysis">song</a> analysis of John Lennon's "Tomorrow Never Knows."</p>
<p>--For perscussionists, a <a href="http://www.berkleeshares.com/drums__percussion/afrocuban_conga_rhythms">Quicktime film</a> on Afro-Cuban Conga rhythms and techniques.</p>

<p>--For producers and engineers, a <a href="http://www.berkleeshares.com/production__technology/set_up_recording_studio_pro_tools">crash course</a> in setting up a recording studio with ProTools.</p>
<p>The site has so much great information that we CC staffers are already getting distracted from work . . . .</p></p>
