<p>San Francisco, CA â€” November 14, 2007</p>
<p>Today Creative Commons released an Add-in for OpenOffice.org which allows users to select and embed a Creative Commons license in documents. Based on work completed as part of the Google Summer of Code by Cassio Melo, the add-in supports Writer (word processing documents), Calc (spreadsheets) and Impress (presentations).</p>
<p>Google Summer of Code provides students with funding to work on open source software between May and August. During summer 2007, Cassio worked on developing the basic OpenOffice.org add-in. Cassio was mentored by Nathan Yergler, Creative Commons CTO, and generously supported by Google's Open Source programs. â€œCassio provided a great foundation for us to build on and maintain. I'm thrilled to finally be able to offer support for OpenOffice.org,â€ said Yergler.  </p>
<p>The Add-in is available without charge, and is licensed under the GNU General Public License. Download information and links to source code are available at http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin. </p>
