<blockquote><p>ISGOODMUSIC.COM started with an internet radio show called "...IS GOOD" w/ Jon Hershfield, which aired on non-profit killradio.org 2005-2008. The show has featured interviews and live performances with over 200 hand-selected SoCal bands. These bands are highlighted and promoted in an online independent music network where artists and audiophiles can utilize free profiles, message centers, gig calendars, and other resources connected to the scene. Isgoodmusic.com regularly sponsors live events throughout the LA area. The website also features its own internet radio stream, isgoodradio.com, which broadcasts "...IS GOOD" as well as other DIY programming relevant to the indie community.</p></blockquote>
