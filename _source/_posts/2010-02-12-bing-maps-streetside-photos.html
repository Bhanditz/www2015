<p>Yesterday, Bing Maps pointed out a new application---<a href="http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/02/11/new-bing-maps-application-streetside-photos.aspx">Streetside Photos</a>---that it added to its <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/search/archive/2010/02/11/spatial-search-the-next-frontier.aspx">spatial search</a>. Streetside Photos pulls CC licensed images from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons">Flickr</a> to use them in a transformative way---as part of mapping tools that help you navigate the world on different visual levels. Chris at Bing Maps <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2010/02/11/new-bing-maps-application-streetside-photos.aspx">says</a> it best,</p>
<blockquote><p>"So, you have all these killer photos of different cities around the world just sitting on some hard drive or server and the best you can do with them is send them to friends as is, right? Isnâ€™t it funny that the photos you tend to zip through are the ones with no people in them, but when you were there man it was a cool shot that you just HAD to capture? Well, weâ€™re giving those photos some love (and context) with our latest mash-in to the Bing Maps Application Gallery. Weâ€™ve just rolled out a new application that is currently in a tech preview phase that pulls photos from FlickrÂ®, associates them with Bing Maps Streetside photos and then overlays them by stretching the photo to form fit where in the world it belongs. The new application called Streetside Photos is currently available in Seattle, San Francisco and Vancouver (Canada) - (hello, Olympics!!) to view your Flickr photos in a whole new way."</p></blockquote>
<p>Bing Maps is a great example of leveraging what CC licenses enable---in this case the ability to reuse and repurpose photos in creative ways that also serve a functional purpose, to better inform people about the cultural landscape of a place. Who doesn't want to see the awesome <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/explore/#5003/0.6044=s:http%253A%2f%2ffarm3.static.flickr.com%2f2760%2f4034907654_701dca9e58_b.jpg&o=&a=0/5872/lat=37.75587&lon=-122.418787&alt=-11.17&z=30&h=-180&p=-9.1&pid=5082">orange skeleton</a> from a past Carnaval in SF?</p>
