<p>Creative Commons is pleased to announce we have been awarded a grant from <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to provide support to successful applicants of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20101436.htm">Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) grant program</a> with our partnering organizations Carnegie Mellon <a href="http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/">Open Learning Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.cast.org/">CAST</a>, and the <a href="http://www.sbctc.edu/">Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges</a>.</p>
<p>The free of charge technical assistance services will offer a competitive advantage for organizations seeking TAACCCT grant funds and ensure that the open educational resources created with these federal funds are of the highest quality. The partnering organizations will provide the following areas of expertise: open licensing, learning and course design, professional development, and adoption and use. TAACCCT applicants interested in these free services should include boilerplate language in their proposal. This suggested language, as well as a high-level description of services, can be viewed at our <strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/taa-grant-program">TAACCCT information page</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is excited to participate in this groundbreaking effort and grateful to The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for its generous support in facilitating open learning.</p>
