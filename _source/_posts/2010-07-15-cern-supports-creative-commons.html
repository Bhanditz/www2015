<p>Creative Commons is deeply honored to announce <a href="http://cern.ch">CERN</a> corporate support at the "creator level". CERN is one of the world's premier scientific institutions--home of the Large Hadron Collider and birthplace of the web. This donation comes on the occasion of the publication under Creative Commons licenses of the first results of LHC experiments.</p>
<p>Dr. Salvatore Mele, CERN Head of Open Access, provided the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The High-Energy Physics community in general, and the frontier experiments it runs at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN aim to unravel the mysteries of the universe. This major ambition can only be reached on foundations of technology and innovation, collaboration and partnership, and perhaps above all, on shared information, which is why this community has strived at Open Access to its scientific results since decades already.</p>
<p>The evolution of scholarly communication in the field, recently embodied by the SCOAP3 initiative, has reached an important milestone with the publication of the first results of the LHC experiments under a Creative Common license. These have appeared in the European Physical Journal (Springer) <a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1140/epjc/s10052-009-1227-4">doi:10.1140/epjc/s10052-009-1227-4</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a>); Journal of High Energy Physics (SISSA), <a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1007/JHEP02(2010)041">doi:10.1007/JHEP02(2010)041</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a>); Physics Letters (Elsevier),  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.physletb.2010.03.064">doi:10.1016/j.physletb.2010.03.064</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>); and Physical Review Letters (APS), <a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.022002">doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.022002</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>).</p>
<p>CERN has become a supporter of Creative Commons to acknowledge the contribution that its licenses make to accelerating scientific communication and simplifying the way researchers share their work. The Creative Commons Attribution license is an important tool for the publication of CERN's experimental results.</p></blockquote>
