<p>Following on the heels of "<a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/41933">Writing Wikipedia Articles: The Basics and Beyond</a>," three more School of Open courses are now open for sign-up. They are:</p>
<h4>1. <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/1196/">Copyright 4 Educators (AUS)</a></h4>
<p>This course will equip Australian educators with the copyright knowledge to confidently use copyright material in the classroom. It will also introduce Open Educational Resources (OER) and teach you how to find and adapt free, useful resources for your classes. The course is open to all educators around the world, but it is specifically targeted to Australian teachers, teacher-librarians from K-12, TAFE teachers, University lecturers/tutors, and University students studying to become teachers. The course material is learnt around practical case studies faced by teachers when using copyright material in their day-to-day teaching and educational instruction.</p>
<p><em>Facilitators: <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/Jessica_Smith/">Jessica Smith</a> and <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/delia%20browne/">Delia Browne</a></em></p>
<p>To sign up, click the "Start course" button on the bottom left of the <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/1196/">course page</a>. </p>
<h4>2. <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/1275/">Copyright 4 Educators (US)</a></h4>
<p>This is a course for educators who want to learn about US copyright law in the education context. Educators who are not in the US are welcome to sign up, too, if they want to learn about copyright law in the US. The course is taught around practical case studies faced by teachers when using copyright material in their day-to-day teaching. By answering the case scenarios and drafting and discussing the answers in groups, you and other participants will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>    What is the public domain?</li>
<li>    What does copyright law protect?</li>
<li>    What is fair use?</li>
<li>    What other exceptions are there in copyright law?</li>
<li>  What are open access educational resources?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Facilitators: <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/lquilter/">Laura Quilter</a> and <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/lilabailey/">Lila Bailey</a></em></p>
<p>To sign up, apply using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LSQD7yBuEnS0Ww6wFnZia7SBafH_hC_ullAEaccyEEc/viewform">Google form</a> -- also linked at the top of the <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/1275/">course page</a>. </p>
<h4>3. <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/1283/">Creative Commons for K-12 Educators</a></h4>
<p>K-12 educators would like to find and adapt free, useful resources for their classes. Some would even like to incorporate activities that teach their students digital world skills -- such as finding, remixing, and sharing digital media and materials on the web. In this lightly facilitated course, we will learn how to do these things with each other in a peer learning environment.</p>
