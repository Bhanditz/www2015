<p>We mentioned late last year that Jeremy Keith's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11118">CC BY licensed photo was used in the film <em>Iron Man</em></a>. While that was particularly notable, Jeremy is a prolific user of CC licenses for his photos and other materials, garnering many reuses. A graphic design student asked him a series of 15 questions about CC. He <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1549">blogged the answers</a>, which are well worth reading. Here's the lead in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iâ€™ve found that releasing <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adactio/" rel="me">my Flickr pictures</a> under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en_GB">a Creative Commons licence</a> has been very rewarding. My pictures have been used in all sorts of places and most people are kind enough to drop me a line and let me know when they use one of my photos. Say, for example, that the site <a href="http://living.morethan.com/"><cite>More Than Living</cite></a> wanted to illustrate the article entitled <a href="http://living.morethan.com/2009/01/19/what-is-a-manbag/"><cite>What is a manbag? </cite></a> with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/adactio/657737577/">a very fetching picture</a> of <span class="vcard"><a href="http://clagnut.com/" rel="friend met co-worker" class="url"><abbr class="fn" title="Richard Rutter">Richard</abbr></a></span>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1549">read the rest</a>.</p>
<p>Uwe Hermann (who we've <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7385">mentioned in the past</a> as a <a href="http://www.hermann-uwe.de/podcast">curator of CC licensed music</a>) also just <a href="http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/list-of-my-creative-commons-licensed-photos-being-used-elsewhere">posted about reuse of his photos</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Even with my humble, and not really widely-known little photoblog, you can already see the Creative Commons license's effects on media sharing and remixing/reusing kick in. Quite a number of my photos have already been used by other people for various different purposes (blogs posts, articles, even <a href="http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/creative-commons-remix-culture--a-practical-example">album covers</a>), including some of the "bigger" sites such as the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/05/07/a-clue-for-tumor-survival-lies-in-how-sweet-it-is/?mod=WSJBlog">Wall Street Journal Blog</a> or <a href="http://cultofmac.com/intel-unveils-lower-cost-mobile-core-2-quad/6497">Cult of Mac</a>...</p></blockquote>

<p>Even <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mlinksva/sets/72157613531054166/">some of my mediocre photos have been reused</a>, and I admit to getting a small kick out of it.</p>
