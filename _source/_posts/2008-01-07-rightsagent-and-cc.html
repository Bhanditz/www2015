<p><a href="http://www.rightsagent.com/">RightsAgent</a>, a "provider of copyright management solutions for user-generated content", launched a little over a month ago with much promise. RightsAgent is built specifically with CC in mind and aims to streamline commercial transactions for CC NC licensed works, giving content creators a platform to "perform copyright transactions with those who wish to license their work" commercially. This is an implementation of what we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7920">recentlly</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7827">coined</a> <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+</a></strong>. </p>
<p>RightsAgent currently supports both <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://revver.com/">Revver</a> users, with more content directories on the way. Although a month late (but nonetheless informative), <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/2007/12/14/all-user-generated-content-doesnt-want-to-be-free-a-qa-with-cambridge-startup-rightsagent-about-its-new-approach-to-copyrighting/">check out this interview</a> with RightsAgent co-founders John Palfrey and Rudy Rouhana to get a better idea for RightsAgent has in store:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creative Commons itself, five years ago when it was founded, filled an extraordinarily important gap in the marketplace. It was very difficult if not impossible for somebody to give away some rights [to their work] and retain other rights. CC became an extremely simple way to do that. Five years later, whatâ€™s clear is that there is great value in what some people are generating online, and the gap we think RightsAgent will fill now is that sometimes you want to give away some rights and sometimes you want to get compensated for what youâ€™ve done. In some context, you might want to license your work freely under CC, and in other contexts you might want to get paid. This system allows you that flexibility. In the same way that Paypal created a simple platform for paying for any e-commerce item on the Web, our idea is to create the same kind of mechanism for the sale of Web 2.0, â€œuser-generated content.â€</p></blockquote>
