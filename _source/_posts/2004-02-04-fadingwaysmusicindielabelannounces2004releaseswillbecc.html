<a href="http://www.fadingwaysmusic.com"><i>Fading Ways Music</i></a>, an indie record label based out of Toronto, announced their 2004 releases will be sold under Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike</a> licenses. Fading Ways Music is the first internationally-distributed label to adopt Creative Commons licensing for its new physical CD releases.  Fading Ways articulates its philosophy for open-licenses nicely on its <a href="http://www.fadingwaysmusic.com/mission.html">mission page</a>.  Neil Leyton, the label's manager, makes a great quote here:  "Music Publishing as a concept is wrong. No one creates songs out of thin air."</p>
<p>
Fading Ways joins other labels, such as <a href="http://www.opsound.org">Opsound</a>, <a href="http://www.magnatune.com">Magnatune</a>, and <a href="http://www.locarecords.com">Loca Records</a> that embrace Creative Commons licenses, enabling fans to rip, mix, and burn their favorite tunes without legal doubt.
