<p>Happy Inauguration Day! Following on the heels of Fred's post, I'd like to point out a Seminar on open knowledge that will take place on February 4th and 5th at the National University of Bogota. <strong><a href="http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/index.php/2008/12/01/acceso-20-seminario-sobre-propiedad-intelectual-en-bogota-el-28-y-29-de-enero-de-2009/">A</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/index.php/2008/12/01/acceso-20-seminario-sobre-propiedad-intelectual-en-bogota-el-28-y-29-de-enero-de-2009/">ccess 2.0: A discussion on intellectual property from the sciences, arts, library sciences, and education</a> </strong>is being hosted and coordinated by the National University of Colombia and the <a href="http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/">Karisma Foundation</a>. ItÂ will address "the important changes [that have occurred] in the past decade with regard to "the way in which we create and broadcast knowledge." The Seminar acknowledges the emerging necessity of open educational resources (OER) and their future impact on the state of education:</p>
<p><em>"The issue of intellectual property and of copyright has ceased to be the exclusive province of lawyers, or to be relevant only in the area of the commercialization of cultural products. It no longer deals solely with concerns regarding remuneration of professional artists. For this reason, the responsibility of academics, teachers, scientists, and managers of information and knowledge in general in the construction of the legal culture has acquired a new and updated dimension."</em></p>
<p>Our very own John Wilbanks, head of <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science Commons</a>, will speak at the meeting. The Seminar itself is free of charge and open to the public, though afternoon workshops will require prior registration.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Seminar is the first step in a four objective research project examining intellectual property in public policy.
