<p>In February we said <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42052">goodbye to Donatella Della Ratta</a>, CCâ€™s longtime coordinator for the Arab world. Today weâ€™re pleased to announce that Naeema Zarif and Sami Ben Gharbia have joined Creative Commons as the regional coordinators for the region. Naeema and Sami join CCâ€™s other <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Regional_Coordinators">regional team leaders</a>, who are key in organizing the Creative Commons <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">Affiliate Network</a> around the world. </p>
<p>After 8 years in advertising, Naeema Zarif took a leap into social enterprise offering expertise on conceptualization and producing both offline and online integrated media initiatives, including print, social web, audio, and film. She is an enthusiastic supporter of open culture, speaking and lecturing frequently at conferences and educational institutes, and contributing visual and digital strategic consultancy and training to various governmental, not-for-profit, and for-profit initiatives around the MENA region.</p>
