<p>Last November, a bunch of us from Wikimedia, Mozilla, P2PU, OKFN, Creative Commons, School of Open, and other communities got together for a session at Mozfest called "<a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40455#collaborations">Collaborations across the Open Space</a>." That session not only laid the groundwork for better communication among open organizations, but also resulted in the momentum to draft a job description for a project coordinator who will "support the development of a stronger network of organizations working in the areas of open knowledge and open access."</p>
<p>The part-time position is being funded by Wikimedia UK with the hope that another organization will pick up it up after the initial 6 month term. The full description is at <a href="https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Open_Coalition_Project_Co-ordinator">https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Open_Coalition_Project_Co-ordinator</a> - but here are the highlights of what we envision the person to be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>    Have a thorough understanding of issues relating to open knowledge, open access, open source, and open content licences</li>
<li>    Lead on the development of a small event for organisations working in this space, including Wikimedia UK, Open Knowledge Foundation, Creative Commons, Mozilla, Open Rights Group, and OpenStreetMap, among others</li>
<li>    Act as a conduit for organisations acting in the open space, facilitating discussion and collaboration</li>
<li>    Lead on the creation of a website and booklet explaining what it means to be an open organisation, what the "open sector" is and the benefits it brings</li>
<li>    Build a relationship of trust with the group and the wider open community</li>
<li>    Develop and deliver sessions about the open coalition at Wikimania in London, August 2014</li>
</ul>
<p>The position is based in London, but will be working with open community members from around the world. Have a look at the <a href="https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Open_Coalition_Project_Co-ordinator">position</a> and also at the <a href="https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Joint_Mozfest_session/Write_up">notes</a> from the original Mozfest session for reference.</p>
