<p>TheÂ <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> has announced aÂ <a href="http://nextgenlearning.com/the-community/blog/2010/10/11/next-generation-learning-challenges?site_locale=en">$20M investment in the Next Generation Learning Challenges</a>, an initiative to improve college readiness and completion through technology.Â The first request for proposals (RFP) <a href="http://nextgenlearning.com/sites/site-1/assets/FInal_RFP.1.pdf">was released today</a> (PDF). The RFP specifically solicits proposals that address the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the use of blended learning models, which combine face-to-face instruction with online learning activities.</li>
<li>Deepening studentsâ€™ learning and engagement through use of interactive applications, such as digital games, interactive video, immersive simulations, and social media.</li>
<li>Supporting the availability of high-quality open courseware, particularly for high-enrollment introductory classes like math, science, and English, which often have low rates of student success.</li>
<li>Helping institutions, instructors, and students benefit from learning analytics which can monitor student progress in real-time and customize proven supports and interventions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The RFP lays out the grant guidelines with regard to open licensing, and requires the use of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">CC BY</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So that the knowledge gained during NGLC-funded projects is promptly and broadly disseminated, all documents, written materials, and other content submitted to EDUCAUSE during the period of Granteeâ€™s NGLC grant application and grant (e.g., website postings, pre-proposals, proposals, findings, and information generated by Grantee) will be made available to the community under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>.Â In addition, all open educational resources and related work product (manuals, integration formats, hosting environments, faculty development guides, or curricula, etc.) created in connection with the Open Interactive Core Courseware challenge must be made available under this license.</p></blockquote>
<p>Adopting CC BY is precisely aligned with the overarching goals of foundation funding and initiatives such as the Next Generation Learning Challenges. Last year, the Berkman Center'sÂ <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2009/Open_Content_Licensing_for_Foundations">study on foundation copyright licensing policies</a> said that open licensing â€œensures[s] the broadest and fastest dissemination of the valuable ideas, practices, works, software code and other materials the foundation's funding helps to create." That report went on to suggest that the impact of funding is even greater when permissive licenses (such as CC BY)Â are applied, allowing the resources â€œto be freely tested, translated, combined, remixed, repurposed or otherwise built upon, potentially by many subsequent researchers, authors, artists or other creators anywhere in the world, as the basis for new innovation, discovery or creation.â€</p>
<p>ProposalsÂ for the <a href="http://nextgenlearning.com/the-grants">first RFP</a> are due November 17, 2010. The Next Generation Learning Challenges are a collaboration between several organizations, including the Gates Foundation, <a href="http://www.educause.edu/">EDUCAUSE</a>, <a href="http://www.inacol.org/">iNACOL</a>, <a href="http://www.ccsso.org/">CCSSO</a>, <a href="http://hewlett.org">The Hewlett Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://www.league.org/">The League for Innovation in the Community College</a>. Congratulations to the Gates Foundation and partnering organizations on this fantastic effort.</p>
