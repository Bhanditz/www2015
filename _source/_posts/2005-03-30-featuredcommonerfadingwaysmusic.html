<p>I recently had a chance to catch up with longtime supporter of Creative Commons, <a href="http://www.neilleyton.com/neilLeyton.html">Neil Leyton</a> from <a href="http://www.fadingwaysmusic.com/">Fading Ways Music</a>. Fading Ways has been a <a href="http://www.fadingwaysmusic.com/mission.html">true leader</a> adopting Creative Commons in the commercial music space, and has even taken to educating others -- Neil is organizing <a href="http://www.musiccommons.org/">this upcoming music symposium</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>  Check out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/fadingways">Featured Commoner</a> interview with Neil, as I'm confident you'll find him to be very insightful.  </p>
