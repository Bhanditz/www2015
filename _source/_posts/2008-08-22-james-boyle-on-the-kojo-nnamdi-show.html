<p>Chair of the CC Board <a href="http://www.james-boyle.com/">James Boyle</a> recently spoke on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojo_Nnamdi">Kojo Nnamdi</a>'s <a href="http://wamu.org/programs/kn/tech_tuesday/">Tech Tuesday</a> radio program, discussing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8826">last week's United States Court of Appeals decision</a> which upholds â€œOpen Sourceâ€ or public license licensors as entitled to copyright infringement relief.</p>
<p>The show, which originally aired on <a href="http://wamu.org/">American University's WAMU 88.5 FM</a>, touches on the decision specifically but also open source tools in general, giving context to why this decision was so important and how it relates to the commons more broadly. You can <a href="http://wamu.org/programs/kn/08/08/19.php#22244">listen to the program</a> (Real Media or Windows Media Player streams available; <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> can be used for the Windows Media stream) at the <a href="http://wamu.org/programs/kn/">Kojo Nnamdi Show site</a>.</p>
