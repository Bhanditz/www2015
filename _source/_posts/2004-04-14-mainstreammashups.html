Cool: David Bowie has just launched <a href="http://www.davidbowie.com/neverFollow/">a new mashup contest</a>. There's a new ad campaign for Audi cars that features two of Bowie's songs mashed up. They've decided to throw a mashup contest to capitalize on this, awarding a new car to the best song that uses samples from his new album and any older Bowie song. Voting on entries starts this weekend and the contest ends next month so get your turntables cranking.</p>
