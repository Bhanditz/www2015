<p>We're thrilled to announce that we have successfully met the $3000 matching giving challenge by <a href="http://3taps.com">3taps</a>, a new startup that makes sifting through classified ads a whole lot easier. We are grateful to 3taps for their support and thankful to everyone who got in on the challenge and doubled the value of their donation to CC. We are in the final weeks of our fundraising campaign, so please continue to pitch in and support the work of CC!</p>

<p>Why 3taps supports CC:</p>
<blockquote><p>"3taps indexes factual data about items offered for exchange, like price, quantity and item description.  Facts like these are important public information that let people find the best deal on the item they want.  There has been a lot of confusion about the status of factual data on the Internet, and confusion in this area inhibits innovation.  Creative Commons' newly-released Public Domain Mark is an important tool for bringing clarity to this area. It couldn't have come at a better time for those interested in collaboration in the sphere of data." - Karen Gifford, co-founder. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24823">More on 3taps</a>.
