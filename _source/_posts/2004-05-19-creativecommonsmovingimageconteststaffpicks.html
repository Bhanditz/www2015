<p>Our panel of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contest/judges">judges</a> announced the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/movingimagecontest">winners</a> of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contest/">Moving Image Contest</a> a few months ago, but the CC team never got a chance to announce our favorite entries.  Though these entries didn't win the contest, they are excellent contributions:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/cccr/FlashEntries/3_Content_Collage/index.html">Content Collage</a> by Mike Telford, is a fun, interactive piece.  Click on the boxes and a brief movie clips appear, along with sound.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/cccr/FlashEntries/4_Shape_Shifter/4_Shape_Shifter.mpg">Shape Shifters</a> by Peter Lewis, has a great animation at the end featuring many of the Creative Commons logos.</p>
<p>
And my favorite, <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/cccr/FlashEntries/11_A_Real_Marketplace/11_A_Real_Marketplace.swf">A Real Marketplace</a> by Chris Hamilton, it a beautiful flash animation detailing an adventure with Creative Commons, and copyright.</p>
