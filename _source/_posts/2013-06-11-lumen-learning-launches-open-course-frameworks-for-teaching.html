<p><a href="http://www.lumenlearning.com">Lumen Learning</a>, a company founded to help institutions adopt open educational resources (OER) more effectively, just launched its first set of course frameworks for educators to use as-is or to adapt to their own needs. The <a href="http://www.lumenlearning.com/courses">six course frameworks</a> cover general education topics spanning English composition, reading, writing, algebra, and college success, and are openly licensed for reuse under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)</a>.</p>
<p>The course frameworks were developed by the Lumen Learning team in concert with faculty members at nine institutions who worked to align the content with defined learning objectives and quality standards. By providing openly licensed course frameworks developed and vetted by experts, Lumen Learning hopes to make it easier for educators and institutions to use OER. From the <a href="http://www.lumenlearning.com/pr052213_courseframeworks">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Our ultimate goal is to provide sustainable open textbook alternatives for an entire general education curriculum and even entire OER-based degree programs," said Kim Thanos, CEO and co-founder of Lumen Learning. "We are thrilled with the interest and momentum we are seeing around OER today. It is definitely a rising tide, benefitting students, instructors and institutions alike."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can browse the CC BY-licensed course frameworks at <a href="http://www.lumenlearning.com/courses">http://www.lumenlearning.com/courses</a>. Lumen Learning will also offer additional course frameworks in business management, psychology, chemistry, biology, and geography in the coming months. </p>
