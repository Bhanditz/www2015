<h2>More about The Universitat de Barcelona</h2>
<p>The Universitat de Barcelona (UB), founded in 1450, is the oldest and largest of the six universities in Barcelona, and of the ten in Catalonia. It has 76.000 students --more than half of the total student population of Catalonia-- and is the second largest in terms of students number in Spain. The UB has four campuses, in different parts of the city. The UB is the main spanish university research centre, and one of the leaders in Europe, in terms of projects and the quality achieved in this field. One of the aims of the University is to create, transmit and expand the cultural, scientific anf technical  knowledge and to contribute to society's development.</p>
<p>The university is particularly interested in fostering international relations, and for many years has been the leader among European universities in numbers of student exchanges organized as part of the Erasmus program. Since 1995, the UB has implemented a quality program aiming fundamentally to design mid and long term strategies in order to evaluate and improve teaching and research in public higher education.</p>
