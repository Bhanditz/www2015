<p>As <a href="http://www.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?at_code=409999">noted</a> <a href="http://redprocess.com/is/libre/">elsewhere</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#53">myself (Jon Phillips)</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#51">Alex Roberts</a>, CC's brilliant graphic designer, attended the spectacular <a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/">Libre Graphics Meeting 2007</a> (LGM2007) in Montreal last weekend, which I highly recommend for others to check out next year!</p>
<p>The highlight for me is always to see my friends and to make new acquaintances like <a href="http://people.mcgill.ca/stamatia.piper/">Tina Piper</a> from CC Canada. Also, Alex and I met up with <a href="http://evan.prodromou.name/">Evan Prodromou</a>, from <a href="http://wikitravel.org">Wikitravel.org</a> amonst other projects, to talk shop about CC, the state of the web, and to sample Montreal's famous dish, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine">poutine</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to underline how key it is for all those in Open ____ (Open Content, Open Source, Open etc) <a href="http://icommons.org/">get together at some point</a> to see each other physically, as often its only virtually. Also, while LGM2007 had a large demographic of Open Source developers working on graphics applications, there was much discussion about open content, standards such as <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/XMP">XMP</a> and what projects like <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, <a href="http://gimp.org">Gimp</a>, <a href="http://scribus.net">Scribus</a> and <a href="http://www.koffice.org/krita/">Krita</a> are going to work on as projects and <a href="http://create.freedesktop.org">inter-project</a>.</p>
<p>Please check <a href="http://rejon.org/2007/05/06/lgm-2007/">out my slides from the presentation I gave</a> about the concept of creating Open Content Libraries beyond <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, to the point where every niche, locale, special-interest, and so forth, and so on, might create a library to house whatever media one sees fit. In this possible future, the importance is not one major silo for content, but many different silos that rely on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Media_Hosting_Wishlist">open standards</a> and Creative Commons licenses for auto-negotiation for the machines to work out so that us humans can get what we want.</p>
<p>In future posts, I will explore these concepts more as they relate to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Business">business</a> and how to implement this future through standards like the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/viewfile/pool_api_doc">Sample Pool API</a> that <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/cchost">ccHost-powered</a>, <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter.org</a> uses.</p>
