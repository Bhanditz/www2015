<p>If you're in the SF Bay Area, we hope to see you at our next <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/San_Francisco_Salon">Creative Commons Salon</a>, which will feature a panel discussion about CC from an international perspective. The panel will feature CC staffers CEO <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board#22">Joi Ito</a>, Arab World Media &amp; Development Manager <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#donatella">Donatella della Ratta</a>, and International Project Manager <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#michellethorne">Michelle Thorne</a>, who will be joined by <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/author/david-sasaki/">David Sasaki</a>, Outreach Director for <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/">Global Voices</a>.</p>
<p>This will be a great chance to learn about how globally diverse communities use Creative Commons, as well as challenges faced in various regions and projects around the world. How do sharing norms, for example, or compelling use cases differ from country to country? What works in one context may not carry over to another, so where do models fail and what lessons can be learned? How can specific fields, such as open education or citizen journalism, solve some of these issues and foster healthier sharing communities?</p>
<p>Come meet CC staff and other free culture friends and enthusiasts from the Bay Area in an informal setting.</p>
<p>When: Tuesday, February 16, 7-9pm<br />
Location: <a href="http://parisoma.com">PariSoMa</a>, 1436 Howard St. (<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=1436+howard+st+san+francisco&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;split=0&amp;gl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=image">map and directions</a>).
