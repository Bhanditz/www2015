<p>I found <a href="http://pia.com.chez.tiscali.fr/Pages/Symbolsuk.html">PIA's Symbols</a> through the Creative Commons <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org">search engine</a> -- a great album of electronic music.  You can find lots of music through the search engine, which has currently indexed only 50,000 URLs out of the 1,400,000 URLs we know to contain CC licensed content (there are another 400,000 URLs in the queue).</p>
<p>Symbols is under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license, so if you use <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Apple's Garageband</a>, or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/main.html">Adobe's Audition</a>, among other music authoring applications, you can remix it.  Imagine how great it would be if there was a "get content" button within these applications, that would find thousands of hours of CC licensed music that you could re-use, or remix. It's only a matter of time.</p>
