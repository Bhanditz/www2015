<p>Winning Track to Be Featured in Film; Top 12 Tracks to Appear on CD</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, USA Â¬â€“ December 6, 2005</p>
<p>Creative Commons, along with filmmakers Kembrew McLeod and Ben Franzen, today announced the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/copyrightcriminals">Copyright Criminals Remix Contest</a>. The competition encourages producers, DJs, and remixers from around the world to use audio snippets from the upcoming documentary film <a href="http://copyrightcriminals.com"><i>Copyright Criminals</i></a> in new, original songs. One winner will have his/her music featured prominently in the final edit of <i>Copyright Criminals</i>. The winning track, along with 11 runners-up, will be included on the filmâ€™s companion CD. The contest will be hosted at <a href="http://ccMixter.org">ccMixter</a> from Tuesday, December 6 through Tuesday, February 28.</p>
<p>Drawing from more than fifty interviews with prominent musicians, artists, scholars, lawyers, and music industry representatives, <i>Copyright Criminals</i> looks at the development of sound collage (also known as sampling). The film explores the complicated impact that copyright law has had on the creative practice of sampling and studies the conflicting opinions artists and others have about appropriation.</p>
<p>â€œThis contest, like our documentary, examines what it means to be creative in an age of digital reproduction,â€ says Kembrew McLeod, co-director of <i>Copyright Criminals</i>. â€œArtists have traditionally borrowed from each other and have been directly inspired by the world around them. But what happens when digital technologies allow for very literal quotes to be inserted into new works?â€</p>
<p>Samples of dialogue by artists like De La Soul, DJ Qbert, and members of Public Enemy, as well as Matmos, Coldcut, and members of Negativland â€“ all taken from interviews conducted for <i>Copyright Criminals</i> â€“ are available online at the popular remix community ccMixter for use as source material to be included in entrantsâ€™ songs. The audio snippets are available to the public for free through the use of Creative Commons licensing, which allows for the sharing of and building upon existing creative works. Entries will be judged by McLeod, Franzen, and author/producer Jeff Chang. Contest rules and details are available at ccMixter.</p>
