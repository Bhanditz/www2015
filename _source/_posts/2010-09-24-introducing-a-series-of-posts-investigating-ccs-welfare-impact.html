<p><strong>CC has recently started thinking more rigorously about its contribution to the world.</strong></p>
<p>First, just so you'll have a general idea about the person writing this post: I am Tal Niv, a PhD student at UC Berkeley with a background in Law, Economics and Computer Science. This post series is intended to start presenting a project I am already knee-deep into, thanks to a <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/05/2010-class-of-google-policy-fellows.html">Google policy fellowship</a>. Our aim with the project, as well as with the post series is not to offer conclusive analysis of CC's impact on welfare (as the term is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics">used by economists</a>), but rather to start a conversation between all of us, that will start untying this complex topic, which despite its importance has been unexplored. Till now. </p>
<p>Everybody knows that CC is here to do good.  After all, we are a nonprofit that is working diligently on its mission to promote sharing and collaboration. Yes, thatâ€™s what we are after; we have long believed that creators want to share and collaborate, and that it would be beneficial to the world if there is much more of that, which is why we are making out utmost to nurture and cultivate such distinctively positive enterprises and the motivations that fuel them.</p>
<p>What is also pretty clear, is that CC is breaking ground in this enterprise. Creative Commons has a hand and a foot in a range of activities that are based on openness in a multidimensional spectrum of creative fields. CC is known by artists, by scientists, by educators, as a facilitator of creative cooperation, known by consumers of knowledge and culture for extending access and quality of their inputs, by creative hobbyists and amateurs as promoter of access, of contribution, of community. Likewise, we are a prominent institution that carries considerable weight among global policy-making entities in the sphere of setting up the normative environment against which the range of creative endeavors are set.</p>
<p>But although our contribution is plain to the eye, or maybe because it is so crystal clear, we have never attempted to analyze it with rigor. We have never bragged in a detailed fashion nor have we been specific with respect to the immense value that we generate. </p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Well, itâ€™s complicated. Partly it is because what I intuited in the former paragraph: Since it is so clear that we contribute, spending time on the straightforward just seems like a waste. Partly, it is because we never required this evaluation for the efficient design of our day-to-day tasks. But those are not the only reasons. </p>
<p>Mainly it is because conducting steadfast evaluation is a very cumbersome project: CC is heavily engaged in fields with self-explanatory benefits whose edges are fuzzy. This makes evaluation and measurement extremely tough, even for the most apt researchers. </p>
<p>If you are fuzzy about what I mean by â€œfuzzyâ€, just ask yourself: What is the value of art? Of basic science? Of open education? Of User Generated Content? Of collaboration itself? What is the value of free access? I donâ€™t know of many who believe they have the answer to these questions. </p>
<p>And unfortunately, surpassing this challenge only rears more challenges; for CC to be able to know how much it contributes, it is not enough to understand how to evaluate the contribution of its target fields to welfare, but it must also understand its incremental contribution to the welfare enhancing capacity of those fields. And there is nothing that makes that increment any more fixed, clear-cut or lucid than the benefits of the baseline fields.  To top that â€“ my fingers are already shaking on the keyboard - it does not suffice to prove that CC incrementally advantages these enterprises, but itâ€™s necessary to show that it does so optimally, i.e., that it is putting the resources that it has to effective use.</p>
<p>At any rate, tough as it is, this is the challenging task that we have undertaken now. Please help by engaging yourself with this intricate analysis, and sharing your deliberations, and if you are just here as a spectator, wish us luck!</p>
