<p><img src="img/ui_logo.gif" alt="Uncensored Interview Logo" title="Uncensored Interview Logo" width="338" height="86" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13156" />Today, <a href="http://www.UncensoredInterview.com">Uncensored Interview</a>, a video producer and licensor of musician interviews, is releasing thousands of videos from its interview footage archive under our most permissive license, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a> also known as CC-BY.  Previously, Uncensored Interviewâ€™s library consisted of premium content available for commercial licensing, but now includes videos available via download in <a href="http://theora.org/">Ogg Theora</a>, a free and open video compression format.  Under CC-BY, users of the content are only required to give attribution to Uncensored Interview as the content source. The site is also creatively using our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+ protocol</a> to help users purchase permissions outside the scope of the Attribution license, such as the right to use the video unaccredited or for endorsement of a commercial product.</p>
<p>Below, find an example* of one of the more than a thousand CC-licensed videos you'll find on the site where <a href="http://www.uncensoredinterview.com/vlogs/11222-matthew-dear-the-more-the-better">electronic musician Matthew Dear discusses his thoughts on file sharing</a>: </p>

<p>You can find all of the Creative Commons licensed videos (with more to come) <a href="http://www.uncensoredinterview.com/topics/cc">in the Creative Commons section of the Uncensored Interview site</a> or subscribe to the <a href="http://www.uncensoredinterview.com/topics/cc.rss">feed of videos here</a>.</p>
<p><em>* You may have noticed that we're featuring video in this blog post. If you take a look at the source, we're using the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#video">&lt;video&gt; tag in HTML 5</a> to point to Uncensored Interview's Ogg Theora file. If you're running <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">Firefox 3.1</a> (currently in beta) then you'll be able to watch the video in the browser's native media player without using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Disrespecting_freedom_of_the_web">proprietary software</a>. If your browser doesn't have Ogg Theora support then the embed will default to UI's Adobe Flash player.  </em></p>
