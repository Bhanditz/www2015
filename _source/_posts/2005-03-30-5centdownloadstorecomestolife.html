<p>A week ago, I blogged about the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5351">5 cent download</a>. Soon after, I heard from <a href="http://www.tryad.org/">Tryad</a>, a virtual band that spans the ocean from <a href="http://www.tryad.org/press_release.html">Japan to Ohio</a>. They decided to open their <a href="http://www.narphonax.com/tryad.php">own 5 cent download store</a>, and also <a href="http://www.narphonax.com/submit.php">offer the service to other artists</a> for free (as long as the bandwidth costs remain manageable).</p>
<p>
So, if you want to sell you Creative Commons licensed music, drop them a line. If you want to support artists who go CC, go buy some music. Let's build some good content, and hopefully, a good market.  </p>

Thanks Tryad for taking this idea and running with it.  </p>
