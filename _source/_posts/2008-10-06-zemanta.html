<p><a href="http://www.zemanta.com/">Zemanta</a> is an online platform for finding and adding "relevant images, smart links, keywords and text" to blog postings. Available in <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/download/">numerous incarnations</a> (Firefox add-on, Wordpress Plugin, etc.), Zemanta queries the text of a blog post against their own "proprietary natural language processing and semantic algorithms" to formulate media recommendations.</p>
<p>Images are pooled from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wikimedia+commons&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and various stock photo providers - as a result, a large number of the photos are CC-licensed. The Zemanta interface displays what license a photo is released under before it is added to the post, making it clear to bloggers what permissions are allowed. You can read more about what Zemanta does <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/about/">here</a> - it is a simple and efficient way to add rich media to blog posts and best of all, its free.</p>
