<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>-meister Victor Stone <a href="http://virtualturntable.org/archives/000311.php">points to</a> the definitive list for the moment of <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/soundblog/Blog/cns!1pXOS7l93k8mqeQ7FlEEmOSQ!907.entry">podcasting safe music resources</a> at Dave's Imaginary Sound Space. <em>Many</em> CC-licensed music sites are listed, including many I hadn't seen before.</p>
<p>Dave's list is a great place to start if you're looking for CC-licensed music for your podcast or otherwise. We have an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/">audio page</a> too.</p>
<p>Victor has another valuable recent post on <a href="http://virtualturntable.org/archives/000313.php">What Licenses Make Sense (To Me)</a>. You have to make your own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">choice</a> when licensing content, but it's always interesting to see inside someone else's thought process on the matter, particularly someone with the perspective of Victor.</p>
