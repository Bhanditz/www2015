<p><a href="http://www.garage.co.jp/en/index.html">Digital Garage</a>, the innovative business that operates <a href="http://www.technorati.jp/">Technorati Japan</a> and <a href="http://www.webtwo.co.jp/">Web 2.0 Inc.</a> has pledged 30, 000 dollars towards Creative Commons' $300,000 fundraising goal for 2006.  They have also pledged an additional 20K towards the annual <a href="http://icommons.org/">iCommons</a> iSummit that will take place this summer, a <a href="http://icommons.org/isummit/">project</a> that which they supported last year as well.</p>
<p>Digital Garage's business model is based on the balance of its core strengths - Information, Marketing, and Financial Technologies. They initiate and support new and creative strategies and solutions and we are honored to be associated with those ideals. Their continued support is greatly appreciated and we look forward to working with them in the future.</p>
