<p>HASTAC's third annual Digital Media and Learning Competition launched yesterday, an initiative supported by the MacArthur Foundation. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9023">Last year</a>'s theme was participatory learning, and CC Learn was awarded a grant for <a href="http://sj.creativecommons.org/">Student Journalism 2.0</a>---a pilot initiative "engaging high school students in understanding the legal and technical issues intrinsic to new and evolving journalistic practices." The pilot, by the way, is in full swing, and we are entering our second semester after the holidays. Check out <a href="http://sj.creativecommons.org/">sj.creativecommons.org</a> for updates.</p>
<p>This year's DMLC theme is "<strong>Competition is Reimagining Learning</strong> and there are two types of awards: 21st Century Learning Lab Designers and Game Changers." From the announcement,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Aligned with National Lab Day as part of the White House's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate">Educate to Innovate</a> Initiative, the 21st Century Learning Lab Designer awards will range from $30,000-$200,000. Awards will be made for learning environments and digital media-based experiences that allow young people to grapple with social challenges through activities based on the social nature, contexts, and ideas of science, technology, engineering and math."</p></blockquote>
