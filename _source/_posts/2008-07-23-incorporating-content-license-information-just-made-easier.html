<p>Creative Commons has announced the release of two very important tools for the developer community.  These tools, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/liblicense">liblicense</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/LicenseChooser.js">LicenseChooser.js</a>, provide simple and standard ways of reading or writing license information to a variety of files.</p>
<p>liblicense is specifically geared towards the desktop application developer who wants to use license information in media files but does not want to implement the low-level code themselves.  LicenseChooser.js, however, is designed to be used in web applications such as a media sharing site for users' pictures or music.</p>
<p>Both of these software packages aim to make the lives of the developers' easier.  One way in which that is accomplished is that these tools will continue to be updated as new versions of Creative Commons licenses are released thus moving the burden from the developer to Creative Commons.</p>
<p>There will be a public demonstration of liblicense at OSCON on July 24th. For more information see the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/8508">Press Release</a>.</p>
