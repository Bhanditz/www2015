<p><a href="http://ourmedia.org/">Our Media</a> is an ambitious new project to host and curate Creative Commons licensed works that others can view, comment on, rate, and download. In conjunction with the <a href="http://www.archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, Our Media is offering free hosting for anyone that would like to upload their works. Our Media also uses a custom version of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tools/ccpublisher">our CC Publisher</a> desktop application tool, and our new version of the CC Publisher tool will soon make it possible for other similar sites to produce their own custom versions.</p>
<p>One of my favorite new works at Our Media was Sam Bisbee's <a href="http://ourmedia.org/node/683">You Are Here video</a>, which is great to listen to and fascinating to watch. The video was made using <a href="http://www.theheadphones.net/bisbeecontactsheets/">thousands of still photos</a> set to music -- quite creative and an inventive way to shoot a music video.</p>
