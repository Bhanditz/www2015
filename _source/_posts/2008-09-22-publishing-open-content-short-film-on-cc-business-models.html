<p><em><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7018138206968267827&amp;ei=wt7XSIOrIKiIqQO6zKHCAg&amp;q=Publishing+Open+Content">Publishing Open Content</a></em> is a short documentary by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Pinter">Frances Pinter</a> and David Percy that looks at how Creative Commons licenses can be utilized in a commercial setting. The film features interviews with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4adX60H8dkM">Tom Reynolds</a>, blogger behind <a href="http://randomreality.blogware.com/">Random Acts of Reality</a> and author of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood,_Sweat_&amp;_Tea">Blood, Sweat, and Tea</a></em>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGVH2lNfKwY">Timo Hannay</a>, Publishing Director at <a href="http://www.nature.com/">nature.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmas-L3TLN0">John Buckman</a>, founder of netlabel <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a><span></span>.</p>
<p>The interviews provide some key insights into how these three disparate individuals combined CC licenses with a successful business plan, a common thread being that by giving away something for free another commodity can be sold. Filmmaker Pinter also heads a CC-based publishing project in Africa titled <a href="http://www.idrc.ca/acacia/ev-117012-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html">Publishing and Alternative Licensing Model of Africa</a> (PALM), of which the information discussed in the documentary has major interest (via <em><a href="http://joelogs.blogspot.com/2008/09/creative-commons-and-business-models.html">Ad Astra</a></em>).</p>
