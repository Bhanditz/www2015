<p>Last Friday (June 15th), <em><a href="http://wherearethejoneses.com/" title="Where are the Jonses? &gt; Homepage">Where are the Joneses?</a></em>, a "daily fictional interactive comedy shot entirely for the web", went live. The show is written collaboratively by the <em>Where are the Joneses?</em> community, released on to YouTube under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" title="Commons Deed">CC Attribution-Sharealike</a> licence, and funded as a marketing experiment for Ford Motors (as a big purple van is featured in every episode).</p>
<p>Certainly a hybrid of ideologies, <em>Where are the Joneses?</em> is as funny as it is forward thinking. This model for media production is <a href="http://www.robmyers.org/weblog/2007/06/17/where-are-the-joneses/" title="Rob Myers Blog">outlined superbly</a> by Rob Myers on his <a href="http://www.robmyers.org/weblog/" title="Rob Myers &gt; Blog Home">blog</a> where he discusses the show in relation to its use of participatory creation, CC licensing, and as a marketing tool. Truly a must read to understand the unique importance of such an experiment.</p>
