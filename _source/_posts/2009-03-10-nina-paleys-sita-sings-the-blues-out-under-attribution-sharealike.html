Talented animator, writer and producer Nina Paley has freely released her animated film, <em>Sita Sings the Blues</em> under our <a href="http://enwp.org/copyleft">copyleft</a> license, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a>. Copies of Paley's feature length film are available on <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Sita_Sings_the_Blues">Archive.org</a>, <a href="http://beta.legaltorrents.com/torrents/386-sita-sings-the-blues---480p-sd">LegalTorrents</a>, and <a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/wiki/index.php?title=SitaSites">various other sites in many different formats</a>. Nina <a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/">explains her decision to her audience on the film's site</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Dear Audience,</p>
<p>I hereby give Sita Sings the Blues to you. Like all culture, it belongs to you already, but I am making it explicit with a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License. Please distribute, copy, share, archive, and show Sita Sings the Blues. From the shared culture it came, and back into the shared culture it goes.</p>
<p>You don't need my permission to copy, share, publish, archive, show, sell, broadcast, or remix Sita Sings the Blues. Conventional wisdom urges me to demand payment for every use of the film, but then how would people without money get to see it? How widely would the film be disseminated if it were limited by permission and fees? Control offers a false sense of security. The only real security I have is trusting you, trusting culture, and trusting freedom. ... </p></blockquote>
<p>Nina's film retells the classic Indian myth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and has already received critical acclaim from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/movies/15roch.html?_r=4&scp=2&sq=Sita%20Sings%20the%20Blues&st=cse">NYTimes</a>, <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/having_wonderful_time_wish_you.html">Rogert Ebert who gave it two thumbs up</a>, and <a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/info.html">many others</a>. On March 7th, it was broadcast <a href="http://www.thirteen.org/sites/reel13/blog/watch-sita-sings-the-blues-online/347/">on PBS/WNET and is now available streaming on thirteen.org</a>. </p>
