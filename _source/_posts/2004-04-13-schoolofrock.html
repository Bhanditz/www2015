<p>Today I had one of the best experiences of my time at Creative Commons, which is saying a lot. I had the pleasure of visiting the <a href="http://chandlerschool.org/">Chandler School</a> in Pasadena, CA, USA, to talk about copyright and Creative Commons. Some 200 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders and I talked about the ins and outs and dos and don'ts of file-sharing, mash-ups, and music copyrights generally.</p>

<p>The students' questions were amazingly insightful and smart, and many of them went straight to some of the most complex and interesting issues in copyright law. I knew when I was setting up my computer and a seventh-grader asked me if Creative Commons "does royalty-free music" that this would be a sophisticated crowd. Here's a taste of some other comments and questions:</p>
<p><em>When the Dixie Chicks did that song by Fleetwood Mac, is that considered a remix? Did they have to pay for that?</em></p>
<p>What about Weird Al Yankovic?</p>
<p>What about those people on American Idol? Do they pay to sing those songs?</p>
<p>So if a copyright lasts for my life and then another 70 years, does that mean if I live a really long time, the copyright is longer?</p>
<p>What if the person who wrote the song has kids, and they want the copyright to last longer?</p>
<p>What about a company? What happens when it dies?</p>
<p>Does a copyright last that long even if the work isn't that famous?</p>
<p>If I buy a CD, can I remix the songs on it?</p>
<p>At the end of the session I showed them Justin Cone's contest-winning <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/movingimagecontest">Building on the Past</a>, to give them an idea what could be made and accomplished without having to pay anyone or worry their parents over possible legal woes. (Yes, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,96797,00.html">such is our world</a> that kids online now have to look out for their <em>parents</em>' interests.) The students gave it a rousing round of applause; there were a few audible "wows," and a couple of students asked when the next contest might happen.</p>
<p>I left the visit inspired to see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#19">Laura</a>'s and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#16">Neeru</a>'s ideas about Creative Commons and education come to life in a big way. (More on that soon.) In the meantime, I hope that the visit isn't CC's last to Chandler -- and that it's our first to a number of schools <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">across the world</a>.</p>
