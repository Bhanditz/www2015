<p>As Lisa Williams <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2006/12/15/newspaper_chain.html">noted</a> her local paper - <a href="http://www.townonline.com/watertown">Watertown TAB</a> - quietly switched over the site to use a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 2.5 license</a>.  Dave Weinberger <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/gatehouse_media_goes_cc.html">noted</a> that his local paper - <a href="http://www.townonline.com/brookline/">the Brookline TAB</a> - did likewise.  The reason â€” <a href="http://www.gatehousemedia.com/">GateHouse Media</a>, a newspaper conglomerate that owns 75 daily and 231 weekly newspapers, has applied Creative Commons licenses to the companyâ€™s TownOnline sites.</p>
<p>Howard Owens, the director for digital publishing for Gatehouse, <a href="http://blogs.townonline.com/watertown/?p=121#comment-1081">explained on the Watertown blog</a> that the decision to opt for a CC license was not a big step for a mainstream media publisher such as Gatehouse because:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Itâ€™s really not a big change from how a lot of newspaper sites handle content â€” free non-commercial use, but generally only if you ask. This removes the middle man of asking, because now itâ€™s explicitly stated that free non-commercial use is permitted. Itâ€™s also way to draw attention to: feel free to redistribute our content in non-commercial ways, please just be sure to link back to the originating site."</p></blockquote>
<p>Removing the middleman?? Hmm, sounds similar to something <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/getcreative/">we might say</a> about skipping intermediaries.</p>
<p>Owens continued to to explain more about the move <a href="http://www.howardowens.com/2006/creative-commons-share-and-share-alike/">on his own blog</a> and address some of the issues and concerns publishers may have.</p>
<p>There have been other newspapers outside of the US who have adopted CC licensing for parts of their publications.  In Italy <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5981">in July 2006</a>, one of the leading Italian newspapers -  La Stampa released its two cultural supplements, <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/_settimanali/tSt/">TuttoScienze</a> (science) and <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/_settimanali/ttl/default_cc.asp">TuttoLibri</a> (books) under a CC license.   In Colombia, the main Colombian paper <a href="http://www.eltiempo.com/index.html">El Tiempo</a> included a CC license option for <a href="http://www.eltiempo.com/participacion/miscontenidos/Ayudacreative.html">its citizen journalism section.</a> And in Portugal, the launch of the CC Portugal licenses was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/2006/12/creative-commons-licenses-offered-in-portugal/">celebrated</a> with the release by one of the largest and most prestigious daily newspapers in Portugal, PÃºblico, of articles under a CC license both online and in the paper edition.</p>
