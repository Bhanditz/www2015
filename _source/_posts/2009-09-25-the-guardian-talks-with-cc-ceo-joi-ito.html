<p>The Guardian just posted a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/sep/23/joi-ito-creative-commons-twitter">great interview</a> with CC CEO <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#93">Joi Ito</a> that, while focusing broadly on Joi's work as an entrepreneur, spends substantial time discussing his role at CC. </p>
<p>The piece touches on a number of topics including how CC interacts with businesses, our commitment to RDFa, and how our licenses can be used:</p>
<blockquote><p>The advantage of the range of Creative Commons licences is that it can be tweaked as the creator likes. "Typically a professional musician will choose a licence that prohibits commercial reuse to protect their income, which usually comes from copyright. But for instance a photographer, and especially an amateur photographer, may want to be well-known, so they focus on attribution. Documentary producers often say 'no derivatives' because they don't want the story to change, but will allow commercial use so that movie theatres can show their work."</p></blockquote>
