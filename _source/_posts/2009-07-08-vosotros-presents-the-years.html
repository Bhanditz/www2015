<blockquote><p>Assembled by a crew of some premier sidemen, this fluid set of thumping soul is the sort of album that  as fun to listen to as it seems like it was to make. With one eye pointed towards the past and the other one winking, they show love for not only the funky greats of the past 30 years, but affection for kitsch, too. Vosotros takes their motto, "music for you-all," seriously. They've made the album <a href="http://www.theyears.fm/album/">available as a free download</a> for a limited time and licensed it under Creative Commons encourage sharing. Enjoy it, remix it, and tell your friends.</p></blockquote>
