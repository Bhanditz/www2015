Michael Mandiberg and Adam Hyde teamed up a couple of weekends ago at the non-profit digital artspace Eyebeam in New York City to translate Michael's CC licensed book, Digital Foundations, into FLOSS software instructions. While the original version of Digital Foundations requires access to Adobe's proprietary CS suite to follow the instructions and screen shots, the new FLOSSmanuals.net version teaches you the fundamentals of design using free-as-in-speech software.</p>
<blockquote><p>Around 25 volunteers convened at Eyebeam over the course of 3 days to translate Digital Foundations from Adobe to FLOSS (Free Libre Open Sources Software) applications, making good on the promise of Digital Foundationsâ€™ Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>Adam Hyde, founder of FLOSSmanuals.net, guided what he has termed the â€œBook Sprintâ€ where both experts and novices collaborate with the aim of writing an entire book in a fixed period of time. The process was exciting, exhausting, an effective. We are proud to say that the new translation of Digital Foundations and Intro to Media Design with FLOSS is currently available on the FLOSSmanuals.net site, and will be in print shortly. One more step closer to easing the monopolizing power of proprietary software companies.</p></blockquote>
