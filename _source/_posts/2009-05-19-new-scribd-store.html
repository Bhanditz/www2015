<p>launched this week, and is covered both by the NY Times and LA Times. Scribd.com is the popular self-described "social publishing company" that allows anyone to upload and share their documents, whether it's a report, a musical score, or the next great Russian novel. Scribd has long had CC licensing built in, which allows you to choose under what conditions you would like to share your work, similar to Lulu.com. Before the Kindle, there was Scribd and its <a href="http://www.scribd.com/ipaper">iPaper</a> viewer, which, though not as fancy, was and is still completely free. </p>

They can also decide whether to encode their documents with security software that will prevent their texts from being downloaded or freely copied.</p>
<p>Authors can choose to publish their documents in unprotected PDFs, which would make them readable on the Amazon Kindle and most other mobile devices. Scribd also says it is readying an application for the iPhone from Apple and will introduce it next month."</p></blockquote>
<p>An alternative to Amazon prices, Scribd e-books can go for as little as $2 a pop, which still gives authors $1.60 per book, more than what they would normally be getting under a traditional publishing contract.  </p>

<p>In contrast, Lulu.com has a business model that allows one to upload and make available under a CC license, like Lulu.com has been long providing for, <em>and</em> sell a print copy online (</p>
