<p>A big part of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/archive/2003/06/#3739">OYEZ Supreme Court audio announcement</a> today is our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/embedding">new strategy</a> for helping people associate license information with MP3s. (We'll soon move on to other file formats.)</p>
<p>Right now we're just showing people how to associate verifiable license links with files. But we want to encourage the developer community and various file-sharing and media player companies to build tools that take advantage of the embedded links to make our licenses useful in the P2P and other non-web contexts.</p>
