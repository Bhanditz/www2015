<p><a href="https://creativecommons.net/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15001" title="CC Network Logo" src="img/picture-24.png" alt="CC Network Logo" width="218" height="59" /></a>Over the last year I've been fortunate enough to work with individuals, organizations, and movements as Creative Commons' Outreach Manager. Starting this week, I will be applying this experience to a new role at CC as our Product Manager for <a href="https://creativecommons.net/">the Creative Commons Network</a>. I'll still be working in NYC and free to meet about CC, but will be primarily focused on developing new features and tools for our community.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't heard of it, check out our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/10061">press release</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10043">post announcing</a> the network in October, and for those of you who have already joined, we should have some exciting announcements for you by the end of the year.</p>
<p>You can also join the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/join/">CC Network now by donating</a>.</p>
<p>For now, if you have any thoughts, suggestions, or questions about the Creative Commons Network, please don't hesitate to get in contact: fred [at] creativecommons.org.</p>
