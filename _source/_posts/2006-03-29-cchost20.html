<p>We've just released <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost">ccHost 2.0</a>, the GPL-licensed software platform that powers <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://fourstones.net">Victor Stone</a> for months of mad coding (when he's not <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/victor">remixing</a>) and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#53">Jon Phillips</a> for packaging the release.</p>
<p>I've already blogged about two new features included in this release, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5773">remix statistics</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5784">sample pool API</a>, but there's much more. Check out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/5838">press release</a> for details.</p>
