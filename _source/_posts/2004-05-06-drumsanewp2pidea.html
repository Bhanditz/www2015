Scott Matthews, of <a href="http://www.turnstyle.com/">turnstyle</a> web mp3 player fame, has launched a new project called <a href="http://www.turnstyle.com/DRUMS/">DRUMS</a>. It's slighty inspired by Creative Commons and the goal is to create a P2P network that is fair to both copyright owners and folks seeking content. If you have something to add to his proposal, pop on over and drop Scott a line.</p>
