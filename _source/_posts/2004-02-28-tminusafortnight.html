<p>Just a little over two weeks until <a href="http://sxsw.com">South by Southwest</a>, the wonderful tech-film-music conference in Austin, Texas, USA (my beloved hometown). If you're in town, come check out our two panels on music (Sample, Share, or Both?) and film (Can Copyright Bring the Audience to the Director?) the morning of March 15. That night we'll have a free party at <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gbase/Guides/Location?oid=oid:44833">El Sol y La Luna</a>, a great Mexican spot on South Congress, co-hosted by our friends at the <a href="http://eff.org">EFF</a> and <a href="http://commoncontent.org">Common Content</a>. <a mailto="info@creativecommons.org">Let us know</a> if you think you'll make it by.</p>
