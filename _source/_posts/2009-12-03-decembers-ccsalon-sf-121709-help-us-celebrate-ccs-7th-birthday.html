On the evening's agenda: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll hear from <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>'s General Counsel, Alex Macgillivray. Alex was previously Deputy General Counsel at Google and has been a supporter of Creative Commons from our very beginning.</li>
<li> A unique installation and presentation of the <a href="http://dublab.com/">dublab</a>/Creative Commons art and music collaboration, <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/">Into Infinity</a>, an online project built on audio loops and circular canvases paired together in infinite combination. Salon-goers will have the chance to draw on some of these 12-inch canvases as well as participate in a live recording of an 8-second audio loop - so get creative and bring a noisemaker of some kind (kazoo, bell, travel guitar, etc.) to help us make some sweet sounds! We'll submit the best one to Into Infinity.</li>
<li> CC's Vice President, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#ml">Mike Linksvayer</a>, will highlight some of CC's major accomplishments from 2009 and talk about what's in store for CC in 2010. </li>
</ul>
<p>This salon will be a great chance to meet and talk to members of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/">CC staff</a>, connect with other free culture enthusiasts from the Bay Area, or just learn more about Creative Commons.</p>
<p>When: Thursday, December 17, 7-9pm<br />
Where: <a href="http://parisoma.com">PariSoMa</a>, 1436 Howard St. (<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=1436+howard+st+san+francisco&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=de&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=image">map and directions</a>). Plenty of street parking available. (Please note, the space is located up two steep flights of stairs, and unfortunately does not currently have elevator access.)</p>
<p>Light refreshments will be provided, and since we rely on the generosity of our community to keep us afloat, weâ€™ll be accepting donations for the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">annual campaign</a> at the door. </p>
<p>Check out the event posting and let us know you're coming on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=189665371358">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/4892602/CA/San-Francisco/CC-Salon/PariSoMa-Coworking-Space/">Upcoming</a>. We hope to see you there!</p>

Can't be at the San Francisco Salon? <strong>You can still help us celebrate CC's 7 years!</strong> CC friends, fans, and supporters across the globe are invited to find creative ways of celebrating the past seven years of CC successes and growth. We want to celebrate Creative Commons using the same ideals of openness, innovation, collaboration, and freedom that are central to CC, so the possibilities are limitless: create a remix or video, bake <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/creativecommons/3115599765/in/photostream/">"CC" cupcakes</a>, host a screening of a CC-licensed film, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon#Resources_for_starting_your_own_CC_Salon">organize an informal salon</a> or meet-up, plan an event around Public Domain Day on January 1, the list goes on. What CC has accomplished in just seven years is phenomenal and worth celebrating in any form!</p>
<p><strong>Let's mark the week of December 14th (and beyond!) as a celebration of free culture, creativity, and knowledge!</strong> Use the tag CC@7 and add any and all photos/videos/blogs/etc. to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2009">7th Birthday Wiki Page</a> so we can highlight how people are celebrating CC that week.
