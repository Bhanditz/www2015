<p>Just after I graduated from NYU, I went to work as the 'free culture' intern at Creative Commons during the summer of 2005. I had started the <a href="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/2008/09/08/free-culture-nyu-moves-on/">Free Culture @ NYU</a> chapter that year and CC felt like a great fit, and still does. But one of the things that puzzled me that summer was that there weren't more free culture student activists in the bay area at the time. Clearly, things have changed.</p>
<p>Through the help of Berkeley's budding Free Culture chapter, <a href="http://www.freeculture.org">Students for Free Culture</a> been able to organize a great conference for Fall break.</p>
<p>We'll have keynotes by CC founder Lawrence Lessig, copyright legend Pam Samuelson, and John Lilly of Mozilla.</p>
<p>Day 1 will be open to the public and consist of panels and presentations in conjunction with the keynotes, and Day 2 will be workshops, team building, and learning about effective activism.</p>
<p>We're doing a pay-what-you-feel system reminiscent of the one made famous by Radiohead and Girl Talk, but with one extra twist: ours also shows publicly what the average amount paid is, and right now it is around $27.</p>
<p>Finally, we have raised money in order to fly students in active chapters out to Berkeley for the conference, so if youâ€™re interested in attending and have registered your chapter with Students for Free Culture, please book your flights now and visit our <a href="http://conference.freeculture.org/travel/">Travel page</a> for more information. </p>
<p>If you're looking to get involved in the Free Culture movement, I couldn't suggest a better way of getting involved in our community. </p>
<p>And for what its worth -- <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5310">when considering interns CC has been known to look favorably upon candidates who have demonstrated involvement in Free Culture chapters</a>.</p>
