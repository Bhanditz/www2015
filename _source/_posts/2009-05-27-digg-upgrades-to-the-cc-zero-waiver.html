<p><a href="http://digg.com/"><img src="img/32x32-digg-guy.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Digg!" class="alignleft" /></a>Joining the likes of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14678">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/">the Personal Genome Project</a>, Digg has now chosen our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 Waiver</a> for their content. Daniel Burka <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=779">writes on the official Digg blog about their choice</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As of today, weâ€™ve taken that one step further by upgrading our public domain license to the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) [waiver]. The CC0 [waiver] expresses that content posted on Digg is public domain even internationally. A minor point maybe, but our previous public domain [dedication] was only clear within the USA. When a friend from Creative Commons suggested that we move to a CC0 license, to even more clearly affirm our intentions, it seemed obvious. And, as we try to always do when we change something that affects the content that you (our users) submit to Digg, weâ€™re trying to keep you informed about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats to the Digg team for taking the step in the right direction for the public domain!
