<p>John Buckman, creator and head of the non-evil, Creative Commons friendly music label <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/">has started his own blog</a>. A recent gem is <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2004/03/major_label_exe.html">the exchange his wife had with a music executive</a> at an industry conference. Great stuff.</p>
