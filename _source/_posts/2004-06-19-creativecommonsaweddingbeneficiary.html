<p>We were honored to get this letter, and a check, from the recently married Joanna and Jaroslaw, of Warsaw, Poland:</p>
<p><em>
<p>
We (Joanna and Jaroslaw) had decided, that during our wedding we want people to donate for charity instead of buying flowers, and as people somehow connected with copyleft/free_content movement we have chosen CC as a beneficiary. We hope, that this money may be spent on starting iCommons Poland.</p>
<p>
Our professional-looking charity box was made from one plastic pot, parts of tea can and lots of duck-tape (see enclosed photos :-))). Response was pretty good, and we collected 552 polish zloty (pln) and 6 Euro (e). With 1e = 4,662pln that made 579,97pln. Bank and sending cost was 30,30pln, what made 549,67pln. With 1$=3.94pln we were able to send you 139,52$.</p>
<p>
BTW our wedding took place on 24th April, but i took us some (too much) time to send a check. Finally we did it yesterday, on May 25th. Please let us now, when (and if) money will arrive. We don't want it to get lost somewhere over Atlantic :-)</p>
<p>
Few words about us: Joanna Maksymiuk is a student of philosophy at <a href="http://www.umcs.lublin.pl/">Curie-Sklodowska University</a> (Lublin, Poland). Jaroslaw Lipszyc is an editor of Warsaw daily <a href="http://www.zw.com.pl/">Zycie Warszawy</a>, but also a poet (all works avalaible under GNU GPL), part of the <a href="http://copyleft.art.pl/ project">Copyleft Art</a> project  and one of <a href="http://terminal.n17.waw.pl/freeculture/">translators</a> of Lawrence Lessig book "Free Culture."</p>
<p>
Thank you for all your efforts in making our world a better place. Supporting you is a pleasure.</p>
<p>
Joanna and Jaroslaw<br />
