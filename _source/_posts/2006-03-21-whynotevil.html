<p>CC-using label <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a> has always had "We Are Not Evil" as a tagline. Now they have a page listing the many <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/03/why_we_are_not_.html">reasons they are not evil</a>, prominently featuring Creative Commons licenses and remixing on <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the business, technical, or <em>music</em> side of open music, check out Magnatune founder <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/">John Buckman's blog</a>, which in just the last few days has several very interesting and relevant posts: <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/03/shannons_update.html">a report on SXSW for Magnatune musicians</a>, <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/03/how_magnatune_c.html">how Magnatune creates podcasts</a>, <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/03/how_i_record_mu.html">how Magnatune records musicians</a>, and the <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/03/bmat_recommenda.html">BMAT recommendation engine</a>.</p>
