<p>We're very excited to announce the first CC Salon, taking place in San Francisco on Wednesday, March 8 from 6pm-9pm at <a href="http://shinesf.com">Shine</a> (1337 Mission Street). In the spirit of gatherings organized by groups like <a href="http://www.remixreading.org/">Remix Reading</a>, <a href="http://dorkbot.org/">Dorkbot</a>, and <a href="http://www.copynight.org/">Copynight</a>, CC Salon will be a casual affair focused on conversation and community-building open to anyone interested in art, technology, education, and copyright.</p>
<p>We've scheduled three terrific presenters for March 8: <a href="http://nwn.blogs.com/">Wagner James Au</a> (<a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>), <a href="http://www.joshkinberg.com/blog/">Josh Kinberg</a> (<a href="http://fireant.tv/">FireAnt</a>), and <a href="http://eddie.com/">Eddie Codel</a> (<a href="http://www.geekentertainment.tv/">Geek Entertainment TV</a>). There will also be music provided by the awesome <a href="http://minuskelvin.com/">Minus Kelvin</a> (read about him <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.09/start.html?pg=8">here</a>).</p>
<p>Shine is a bar (so, it's 21+). Please invite your friends, colleagues, and anyone you know who might be interested in drinks and discussion.</p>
<p>We've set up a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">wiki</a> where you can find the latest information about CC Salon. This will also serve as a place where the community can contribute ideas, make suggestions, and submit proposals for future events.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
