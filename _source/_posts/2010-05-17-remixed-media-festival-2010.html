For those of you in the New York area (or looking to tune in from afar), an awesome event is taking place at the end of the month in Brooklyn's Galapagos Art Space. The <a href="http://www.lofilounge.org/remixed-media-festival-2010/">RE/Mixed Media Festival</a> is a celebration of remix and collaborative creation, especially the kind that is enabled by Creative Commons licenses. From the announcement,</p>
<blockquote><p>On Sunday May 30th at 2PM, Galapagos Art Space in Brooklyn will play host to over 60 artists in a day-long celebration of remix and collaborative creation. Produced by The League of Independents (<a href="http://www.lofilounge.org/">LOFI</a>), the RE/Mixed Media Festival is a means of contributing to the ongoing conversation about remixing, mashups, creative appropriation, copyright law, fair use, and the freedom of artists to access their culture in order to add to and build upon it... Galapagos [will be transformed] into a multimedia art space for a full day/evening of remixed film, video, music, performance, sound, painting, photography and fashion. Panel discussions will include artists talking about the pros and cons of appropriation and collaborative art, moderated by social media activist and author, Deanna Zandt; a talk about DMCA takedowns with Elizabeth Stark and Kenyatta Cheese; and a panel on 'Extending Game Culture' featuring Jesper Juul, Paul Jannicola, and Kerria Seabrooke, and moderated by Josephine Dorado. The event is free and will also be streamed live on the festival's website at <a href="http://www.remixedmedia.org">www.remixedmedia.org</a>.</p></blockquote>
