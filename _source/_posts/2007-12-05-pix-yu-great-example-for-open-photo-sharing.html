<p>Kudos to <a href="http://www.pix-yu.com/" title="Pix-Yu">Pix-Yu</a> for creating an engaging social networking site where users can easily share photo events. Pix-Yu supports Creative Commons licensing and is promoted as an "online virtual space in which users can share life experiences, events, journeys, holidays and meetings etc, by uploading an unlimited number of pictures."</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> has been one of the most visible supporters of Creative Commons over the past few years, now displaying over <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/" title="Flickr CC">54 million CC-licensed photos</a>. We're always working to explore CC integration with both new and existing sites and services. While Flickr has just passed the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/11/flickr-two-bill.html" title="Flickr passes 2 billion photos">2 billion photo mark</a>, Facebook claims to hold twice as many. It'd be fantastic to see important photo-sharing sites like <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" title="Picasa">Picasa</a>,  <a href="http://photobucket.com/" title="Photobucket">Photobucket</a>, and others incorporate CC licensing. Together we can work towards a critical mass of open photography. Pix-Yu is a great example of a start-up networking site that is supporting user creativity by enabling open content sharing from the get-go.</p>
