<p>Creative Commons Australia is putting their annual conference on wheels. Previously, the national meet-ups were held at the project's home base in Brisbane. Now the team is <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/cc-roadshow-2010">hitting the road</a> and taking the event to <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/cc-roadshow/cities">cities across the country</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/cc-roadshow/cities" target="_blank">Each CC Roadshow</a> is designed for those interested in <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/learn-more" target="_blank">finding out about CC for the first time</a>, looking for an update on recent developments, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/version3" target="_blank">Australian Version 3.0 licenses</a>, or just wanting to know <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/casestudiesvol1">how CC is being used</a> by people in their local area.</p>
<p>Six cities are already mapped on the itinerary, and the team wants to involve as many members of the local community as possible. CC champions across the country are sought to develop the program. If you are a musician,  filmmaker, policy maker, photographer, educator, lecturer,  librarian or  anyone else for that matter, and youâ€™re using Creative  Commons, CC Australia <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/contact">wants  to hear from you</a>.Â <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/contact"></a></p>
<p>This is a great initiative, and we can't wait to follow the show from Perth to Hobart -- no doubt encountering plenty of inspiring people, engaging discussions, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia%27s_Big_Things">Big Things</a> along the way!</p>
