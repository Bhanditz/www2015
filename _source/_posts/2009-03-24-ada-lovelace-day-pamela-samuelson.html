<p>Today (March 24) is <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ada Lovelace Day is an international day of blogging to draw attention to women excelling in technology.</p>
<p>Womenâ€™s contributions often go unacknowledged, their innovations seldom mentioned, their faces rarely recognised. We want you to tell the world about these unsung heroines. Entrepreneurs, innovators, sysadmins, programmers, designers, games developers, hardware experts, tech journalists, tech consultants. The list of tech-related careers is endless.</p></blockquote>
<p>And includes tech lawyers. It seems highly appropriate for CC's contribution to Ada Lovelace Day blogging be to highlight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Samuelson">Pamela Samuelson</a>, a giant in the field of law and technology, in particular copyright and technology.</p>
<p><a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~pam/">Samuelson</a> is Professor at the University of California at Berkeley with a joint appointment in the School of Information  and the School of Law and co-directs the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.</p>
<p>Also see our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7594">post</a> on Samuelson's copyright reform thinking and a <a href="http://freecultureberkeley.blip.tv/file/1777301/">video of her excellent keynote of last year's Students for Free Culture Conference</a>.</p>
