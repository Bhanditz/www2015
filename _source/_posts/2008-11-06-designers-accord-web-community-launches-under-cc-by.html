<p>Some very cool news from the design world: <a href="http://www.designersaccord.org/">The Designers Accord</a>, a community of more than 100,000 designers who are committed to environmentally-friendly and socially-responsible design practices (read more the project in GOOD Magazine's <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/section/Portraits/designs_on_the_future">interview</a> with founder Valerie Casey) has launched an online   platform for sharing design ideas. The <a href="http://community.designersaccord.org/pages/home">Designers Accord Web Community</a> is a collection of case studies, resources, methodologies, and best practices that have been created by designers and are intended for public use. All submissions and materials on the site are available under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a> license. This approach will enable the development of a body of freely-licensed design resources that can be used by people around the world, even for commercial purposes. A big bravo to the people behind this incredible effort!</p>
<blockquote><p>If the Designers Accord community site was a traditional website, it might behave like a catalog or encyclopedia of best practices, cases studies, and references. Most likely, it would present a single voice to an audience of listeners.</p>
<p>It would be hugely helpful to all of us if that universal resource existed. But it doesn't. Yet.</p>
<p>We can create this resource through our coalition. The reason we have the Designers Accord is that the creative community has yet to create a definitive set of instructions, or a clearly defined roadmap for fully integrating the principles of sustainability into our work. We are struggling through these difficult challenges together, and this site is a repository for content related to this journey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks very much to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/alumni#58">Katy Frankel</a> for introducing us to the people at the Designers Accord and for her help in making this happen.</p>
