<p><a href="http://www.aduki.net.au/">Aduki Independent Press</a>, a boutique publishing company based in Melbourne, Australia, announced last week that one of their upcoming releases, <em>Stick This In Your Memory Hole</em> by Tristan Clark, will be  made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.1/au/">CC Attribution-Noncommercial licence</a>. </p>
<p>A collection of 37 essays, <em>Stick This In Your Memory Hole</em> uses satire, insight and the occasional foul language to critique the state of politics and society in contemporary Australia.<a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/132">According to CC Australia</a>, this is the first case of a book being released independently by an Australian publisher under a CC license. From <a>CCau</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As far as we are aware, this is the first case of a book being released independently by an Australian publisher under a CC licence. Sure, we've published a few books ourselves (including the excellent Open Content Licensing: Cultivating the Creative Commons), and rumour has it there are some self-publishing efforts. But Aduki seems to be the first independent publisher in Australia to get behind its author's wish to truly share their book with the nation using CC.</p>
<p>Breaking out from the pack and taking the plunge into open content licensing isn't an easy decision for a small publisher to make, and Aduki deserves to be congratulated. But, as they say in their press release, with its strong message in support of free speech 'Stick this in your memory hole' is the perfect book to begin with.</p>
<p>As Emily Clark of Aduki press puts it "We really liked the idea of giving people easy access and the right to use the work without seeking our permission as the book has an important message that needs to be shared."</p></blockquote>
