<p>
			Over on our blog, CC board member Jimmy Wales&mdash;also the founder of Wikipedia&mdash;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24368">is encouraging everyone</a> to join him in <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1110&amp;utm_medium=ccorg&amp;utm_source=newsletter">donating money to Creative Commons</a>: &quot;Billions of people benefit in some way from the work of Creative Commons,&quot; he says, &quot;but I fear that it is too often overlooked because the work is by nature free of charge, and because it is &#39;infrastructure.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>
			Open access scholarly journal publisher <strong><a href="http://www.hindawi.com/">Hindawi</a> has also committed to a matching challenge of up to $3000</strong>. <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate?utm_campaign=newsletter_1110&amp;utm_medium=ccorg&amp;utm_source=newsletter">Donate now</a> to have your gift automatically doubled, but only for a limited time!</p>
<p>
			We&#39;re delighted to have the support of Hindawi, a company that truly embodies the spirit and success of an open licensing business model. Here&#39;s why Hindawi supports CC: &quot;As an open access journal publisher we believe that it is important for our readers to be comfortable reusing and redistributing our articles without fear of violating any copyright restrictions, and Creative Commons licenses make it clear to readers what they can do with our content.&quot;</p>
<p>
			<strong>So what are you waiting for?</strong> If you care about the values of sharing and openness, join Jimmy Wales, Hindawi, and our other amazing supporters in <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1110&amp;utm_medium=ccorg&amp;utm_source=newsletter">funding the current and future work of Creative Commons</a>!</p>

			Open movie project advocate Ton Roosendaal of the Blender Institute explains why he released his new computer animated short film, <em>Sintel</em>, under a CC license. &quot;We want our users to learn from [our projects], to dissect our tricks and technology, and use them for other works.&quot; If you haven&#39;t seen <em>Sintel</em>, it&#39;s a must: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24149?utm_campaign=newsletter_1110&amp;utm_medium=ccorg&amp;utm_source=newsletter">read the full interview with Roosendaal</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24388?utm_campaign=newsletter_1110&amp;utm_medium=ccorg&amp;utm_source=newsletter">watch Sintel here</a>.</p>
