<p>We're pleased to announce that we've uploaded all <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">the WIRED CD</a> tracks <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=wired%20cd%20AND%20mediatype%3Aaudio%20AND%20collection%3Aopensource_audio">to the Internet Archive</a> in lossless formats. We've linked the MP3s on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">the WIRED page</a> as well.</p>
<p>Another big announcement is our new music remix community site, which we're calling <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">CC Mixter</a>. It's a way to upload songs, loops, and acapella tracks to be remixed by other users, and when they do, they'll associate their songs with the originals. To see it in action, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/by/Wired">check out all the WIRED songs</a>, and then <a href="http://ccmixter.org/by/victor">check out Victor Stone's remixes</a> of those. If you'd like to contribute, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/wired/loops">we've uploaded a bunch of loops extracted from the WIRED CD</a> tracks to build upon.</p>
<p>It's a new project and we're soft launching it to the public today to gather bugs. We're still working on many parts of it, so if try it out and find any bugs, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/forum/index.php?forum=2">let us know in the forums there</a>. We should have a big announcement sometime next week about a contest surrounding the WIRED CD. Stay tuned for info on that.</p>
