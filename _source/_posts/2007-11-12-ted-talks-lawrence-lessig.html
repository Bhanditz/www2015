<p>If interested, check out <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/187">this great video</a> of a talk CC CEO Lawrence Lessig gave back in March 2007 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_%28conference%29">The Annual TED Conference</a> entitled "How Creativity is Being Strangled by the Law". There are some sections that are bound to be familiar to those in the CC-community while there are others that are entirely new - <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/my_ted_talk_is_up.html">as he himself points out</a>, "Somethings old, somethings new, lots that's borrowed, none that's blue".</p>
