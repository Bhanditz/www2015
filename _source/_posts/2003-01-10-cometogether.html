<p>Richard Koman has a nice first-hand <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2003/01/03/cc.html">account</a> of our license release party on the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/">O'Reilly Network</a>.  (This slipped past our radar last week.)  Koman describes the event as an <em>Eldred v. Ashcroft</em> "reunion night," which is somewhat accurate, though we'll take the opportunity to remind folks that Creative Commons has no official ties to the Supreme Court case.</p>
<p>Oh, and -- another fine distinction -- this time Jack Valenti is on the same side as Lessig.  Read Koman for the details.</p>
