<p><a href="http://creativecommons.hu/">Creative Commons Hungary</a> sent a nice happy new year wish to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss#community">Creative Commons community mailing list </a>in the form of <a href="http://remix.creativecommons.hu/english/index.html">the first Hungarian CC licensed music album</a> (all tracks are licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/hu/">CC BY-NC 2.5 Hungary</a>). CC Hungary's Bodo Balazs says the remix album is made-up of "broken etno, beatbox'n'bass, world noise." </p>
<p>The <a href="http://remix.creativecommons.hu/english/index.html">remix websites</a> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 2004 many bands, including the Beastie Boys, David Byrne, and Zap Mama, also released songs under CC licence on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">Wired CD</a>.The remix contest was such a hit that we are now trying to repeat this success in Hungary as well. And the jury! A bunch of musicians with international acclaim: DJ Vadim, Szakcsi Lakatos BÃ©la, Mitsou and Dj Palotai!
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting album that is fusing localized acoustic Hungarian sounds with some electronically mediated cuts and breakbeats. Check it out! </p>
<p><strong>ADVANCED:</strong> If you are using Unix/Linux, you can grab them all at once with this command:</p>
