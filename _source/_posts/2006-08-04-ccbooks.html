<p>Been looking for a good book to read lately? <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#61">Margot</a>, one of our Summer '06 interns, has put the finishing touches on a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Books">page</a> of the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Main_Page">CC wiki</a> devoted to listing the various books that have been published under a Creative Commons license.  The page is split into categories.  The first, more conventional types of books - being "works over 35,000 words that are or have been commercially available in hardcopy and have an ISBN," both <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Books#Fiction">fiction</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Books#Nonfiction">non-fiction</a>.  Then there is also a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Books#Lulu_Highlights">section</a> highlighting CC-licensed works on <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> (who we recently <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/lulu">featured</a>), including the always fun <a href="http://www.55fun.com/">"55 Ways to Have Fun With Google"</a> by Philipp Lenssen, which is licensed to the public under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>.  And finally, a category for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Books#.22Books.22_online">"online books"</a> such as <a href="http://www.futureofthebook.org/gamertheory/">"GAM3R 7H30RY"</a> by McKenzie Wark which introduces some of us to the concept of a "networked book."</p>
