<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7760">Featured Commoners</a> <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/">Jamglue</a> are at it again with <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/contests/dolla">yet another amazing remix contest</a>, this time giving users the ability to remix <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolla_%28rapper%29">Dolla's</a> "Who the F*** Is That". Entries are due by May 11th and the winner will receive an autographed poster, their remix on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dolla">Dolla's MySpace</a>, and a phone call from Dolla himself.</p>
<p>Adding to their <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7874">already</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7914">deep</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7683">and</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7603">successful</a> contest history, Jamglue has made a real case for CC-fueled remix contests as a positive means for artists to engage with the ingenuity of their fans while retaining commercial interests. Artists are able keep hold of their ability to negotiate licensing deals and explore commercial avenues while fans are able to engage with the music in a more interactive way, promoting a positive discourse that blurs the lines between creator and consumer.</p>
