<p>To celebrate Yahoo!'s 10th birthday, they created a great <a href="http://birthday.yahoo.com/netrospective/">Netrospective</a>, highlighting significant events on the Web over the last ten years.  We were honored to learn that Creative Commons is number 79 of 100 moments on the Web. Happy birthday Yahoo!</p>
