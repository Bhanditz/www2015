<p>This week's featured content is Andrew "bunnie" Huang's controversial book "<a href="http://hackingthexbox.com/">Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering</a>." The book is <a href="http://hackingthexbox.com/preorder.html">available for order</a> from his site, Amazon, and Barnes and Noble, and the text is Creative Commons licensed. The book has <a href="http://hackingthexbox.com/bookhistory.html">a colored history</a> involving Microsoft, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), and potential lawsuits that forced him to self-publish it before finding a suitable publisher. <a href="http://hackingthexbox.com/">The book site</a> features sample sections from pages throughout the book.</p>
