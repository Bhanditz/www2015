<p>John Sundman has <a href="http://www.wetmachine.com/item/1389">published his third gonzo SF novel</a>, <em>The Pains</em>, under a CC BY-NC-ND license. As usual when it comes to CC-licensed SF, Cory Doctorow has more on the story <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/15/sundemans-the-pains.html">over at Boing Boing</a>.</p>
<p>We published an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5872">interview with Sundman about his use of CC licenses</a> back in 2006.</p>
<p>You can download, buy, or donate in support of all three of Sundman's novels on his <a href="http://wetmachine.com">wetmachine.com</a> site.</p>
