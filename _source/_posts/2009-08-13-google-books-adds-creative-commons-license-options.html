<p>Some very exciting news for authors, publishers, and readers: Today, Google launched a program to enable rightsholders to make their Creative Commons-licensed books available for the public to download, use, remix, and share via Google Books.</p>
<p>The new initiative makes it easy for participants in Google Books' Partner Program to mark their books with one of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">six Creative Commons licenses</a> (or the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ">CC0 waiver</a>). This gives authors and publishers a simple way to articulate the permissions they have granted to the public through a CC license, while giving people a clear indication of the legal rights they have to CC-licensed works found through Google Books.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2009/08/bringing-power-of-creative-commons-to.html">Inside Google Books</a> post announcing the initiative talks a bit about what this all means:</p>
<blockquote><p>We've marked books that rightsholders have made available under a CC license with a matching logo on the book's left hand navigation bar. People can download these books in their entirety and pass them along: to friends, classmates, teachers, and so on. And if the rightsholder has chosen to allow people to modify their work, readers can even create a mashup--say, translating the book into Esperanto, donning a black beret, and performing the whole thing to music on YouTube.</p></blockquote>
<p>The project launched with a terrific starter collection of CC-licensed books that includes: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-XDkb3htVikC&amp;printsec=frontcover">55 Ways to Have Fun with Google</a> by Philipp Lenssen; <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Y7DOltmSGjgC&amp;printsec=frontcover">Blown to Bits</a> by Harold Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry R.

<p>Stay tuned for further announcements - as the project expands to include more authors and publishers, Google Books plans to add the ability for people to restrict searches to books they can share, use, and remix.</p>
