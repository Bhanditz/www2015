While it doesn't carry a Creative Commons license or promote licensed work exclusively, the new website <a href="http://collagemania.blogspot.com/">Collage Mania</a> is worthy of mention here because it's the first time I've seen a blog focused solely on great collage work found online.</p>
<p>
Most Creative Commons licensed photographs (the ones that don't carry the No Derivatives clause) are open to collage, and this site showcases a lot of great work and may give you ideas for your next collage project.</p>
