<p><a href="http://www.jamendo.com">Jamendo</a> recently passed the <a href="http://lkratz.blogspot.com/2006/05/jamendo-more-than-1000-creative.html">1,000 album mark</a>, more than <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/?p=stats">doubling</a> since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Congratulations! Jamendo is a great place to find CC licensed music.  See their <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/?p=music&tag=&l=all&o=rating_desc&cani=&aclass=2%2C3">top albums by popularity</a> and a search form on the side of that page that allows you to only see albums that match your licensing needs (commercial use, derivative works), just like <a href="http://creativecommons.org/find/">Yahoo! and Google</a> web searches for CC.</p>
