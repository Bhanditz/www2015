<p>You  may have heard that data is huge -- changing the way science is done,  enabling new kinds of consumer and business applications, furthering  citizen involvement and government transparency, spawning a new class of  software for processing big data and new interdisciplinary class of  â€œdata scientistsâ€ to help utilize all this data -- not to mention  metadata (data about data), linked data and the semantic web -- thereâ€™s a  whole lot of data, thereâ€™s more every day, and itâ€™s potentially  extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Much  of the potential value of data is to society at large -- more data has  the potential to facilitate enhanced scientific collaboration and  reproducibility, more efficient markets, increased government and  corporate transparency, and overall to speed discovery and understanding  of solutions to planetary and societal needs.</p>
<p>A  big part of the potential value of data, in particular its society-wide  value, is realized by use across organizational boundaries. How does  this occur (legally)? Facts themselves are not covered by copyright and  related restrictions, though the extent to which this is the case (e.g.,  for compilations of facts) varies considerably across jurisdictions.  Many sites give narrow permission to use data via terms of service. Much  ad hoc data sharing occurs among researchers. And increasingly, open  data is facilitated by sharing under public terms, e.g. CC licenses or  the CC0 public domain dedication.</p>
<p><strong>CC tools, data, and databases</strong></p>
<p>Since  soon after the release of version 1.0 of the CC license suite  (December, 2002) people have published data and databases under CC  licenses. MusicBrainz is an early example (note their <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_License">recognition</a> that parts of the MusicBrainz database is strictly factual, so in the  public domain, while other parts are licensible). Other examples include  Freebase, DBpedia (structured information extracted from Wikipedia),  OpenStreetMap, and various <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Government_use_of_Creative_Commons">governments</a> (Australia in particular has been a leader).</p>
<p>More recently CC0 has gained <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data">wide use</a> for releasing data into the public domain (to the extent it isnâ€™t  already), not only in science, as expected, but also for bibliographic,  social media, public sector data, and much more.</p>
<p>With  the exception of strongly recommending CC0 (public domain) for  scientific data, Creative Commons has been relatively quiet about use of  our licenses for data and databases. Prior to coming to the public domain recommendation for scientific data, we published a <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060420192424/http://sciencecommons.org/data/dbfaq">FAQ</a> on CC licenses and databases, which is still informative. It is  important to recognize going forward that the two are complementary: one  concerns what ought be done in a particular domain in line with that domainâ€™s tradition (and public funding sources), the other what is possible with respect to CC licenses and databases.</p>
<p>This is/ought distinction is not out of line with CCâ€™s general approach -- to offer a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses">range</a> (but not an infinity) of tools to enable sharing, while encouraging use of tools that enable <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051">more sharing</a>,  in particular where institutional missions and community norms align  with more sharing. For a number of reasons, now is a good time to make  clear and make sure that our approach to data and databases reflects  CCâ€™s general approach rather than an exaggerated caricature:</p>
<ul>
<li>We  occasionally encounter a misimpression that CC licenses canâ€™t be used  for data and databases, or that we donâ€™t want CC licenses to be used for  data and databases. This is largely our fault: we havenâ€™t actively  communicated about CC licenses and data since the aforementioned FAQ  (until very recently), meaning our only message has been â€œpublic domain  for scientific dataâ€ -- leaving extrapolation to other fields to the  imagination.</li>
<li>Our  consolidation of CC education and science â€œdivisionsâ€ has facilitated  examinations of domain-specific policies, and increased policy  coherence.</li>
<li>Ongoing  work and discussions with CCâ€™s global affiliate network; many CC  affiliates are deeply involved in promoting open public sector  information, including data.</li>
<li>The existence and increasing number of users of CC licenses for data and databases (see third paragraph above).</li>
<li>A  sense of overwhelming competitive threat from non-open data; the main  alternative to public domain is not sharing at all -- absence of a  strong CC presence, except for a normative one in science, creates a  correspondingly large opportunity cost for society due to â€œfailed  sharingâ€ (e.g., under custom, non-interoperable terms) and lack of  sharing.</li>
<li>A  long-term shift in understanding of CCâ€™s role: from CC as purveyor of a  variety of tools and policies to CC as steward of the commons, and thus  need to put global maximization, interoperability and standards before  any single tool or policy idea that sounds good on its own, and to encourage (and sometimes push) producers of data and databases to do the same.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ve  thought and learned a lot about data and databases and CCâ€™s role in  open data. In 2002 data was not central to CCâ€™s programs, now (in  keeping with the times), it is.</li>
<li>Ongoing  confusion among providers and users of data about the copyrightability  of data (it depends) and rights that may or may not exist as a result of  how the data is compiled and distributed -- the database.</li>
<li>Later  in 2011 we expect to begin a public requirements process for version  4.0 of our license suite. At the top level, we know that an absolute  requirement will be to make sure the 4.0 licenses are the best possible  tools (where public domain is not feasible, for whatever reason) for  legally sharing data possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>One  other subtlety should be understood with respect to current (3.0) CC  licenses. Data and databases are often copyrightable. When licensed  under any of our licenses, the license terms apply to copyrightable data  and databases, requiring adaptations that are distributed be released  under the same or compatible license terms, for example, when a  ShareAlike license is used.</p>
<p><strong>Database rights</strong></p>
<p>Databases are covered by additional rights (sometimes called â€œsui generisâ€  database rights) in Europe (similar database rights exist in a few  other places). A few early (2.0) European jurisdiction CC license  â€œportsâ€ licensed database rights along with copyright. Non-EU  jurisdiction and international CC licenses have heretofore been silent  on database rights. We adopted a policy that version 3.0 EU jurisdiction  ports must waive license requirements and prohibitions (attribution,  share-alike, etc) for uses triggering database rights -- so that if the  use of a database published under a CC license implicated only database  rights, but not copyright, the CC license requirements and prohibitions  would not apply to that use. The license requirements and prohibitions,  however, continued to apply to all uses triggering copyright.</p>
<p>CC  licenses other than EU jurisdiction 3.0 ports are silent on database  rights: databases and data are licensed (i.e., subject to restrictions  detailed in the license) to the extent copyrightable, and if data in the  database or the database itself are not copyrightable the license  restrictions do not apply to those parts (though they still apply to the  remainder). Perhaps this differential handling of database rights is  not ideal, given that all CC licenses (including jurisdiction ports)  apply worldwide and ought be easily understandable. However, those are  not the only requirements for CC tools -- they are also intended to be  legally valid worldwide (for which they have a good <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26115">track record</a>) and produce outcomes consistent with <a href="../about">our mission</a>.</p>
<p>These  requirements mandate the caution with which we approach database rights  in our license suite. In particular, database rights are widely  recognized to be <a href="http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/182#10">bad policy</a>, and instance of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/25560">general class of additional restrictions that are harmful</a> to the commons, and thus harmful to collaboration, innovation,  participation, and the overall health of the Internet, the economy, and  society.</p>
<p>If  database rights were to be somehow â€œexportedâ€ to non-EU jurisdictions  via CC licenses, this would be a bad outcome, contrary not only to our  overall mission, but also our policy that CC licenses not effectively  introduce restrictions not present by default, e.g., by attempting to  make license requirements and prohibitions obviate copyright exceptions  and limitations (see â€œpublic domainâ€ and â€œother rightsâ€ on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">deeds</a>, and the relevant <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Do_Creative_Commons_licenses_affect_fair_use.2C_fair_dealing_or_other_exceptions_to_copyright.3F">FAQ</a>).  Simply licensing database rights, just like copyright, but only to the  extent they apply, just like copyright, is an option -- but any option  we take will be taken very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>What does all this mean right now?</strong></p>
<p>(1) We do recommend  CC0 for scientific data -- and weâ€™re thrilled to see CC0 used in other  domains, for any content and data, wherever the rights holder wants to  make clear such is in the public domain worldwide, to the extent that is  possible (note that CC0 includes a permissive fallback license,  covering jurisdictions where relinquishment is not thought possible).</p>
<p>(2)  However, where CC0 is not desired for whatever reason (business  requirements, community wishes, institutional policy...) CC licenses can  and should be used for data and databases, right now (as they have been  for 8 years) -- with the important caveat that CC 3.0 license conditions do not extend to â€œprotectâ€ a database that is otherwise  uncopyrightable.</p>
<p>(3)  We are committed to an open transparent discussion and process around  making CC licenses the best possible tools for sharing data (including  addressing how they handle database rights), consistent with our overall  mission of maximizing the value of the commons, and cognizant of the  limitations of voluntary tools such as CCâ€™s in the context of  increasingly restrictive policy and overwhelming competitive threat from  non-sharing (proprietary data). This will require the expertise of our  affiliates and other key stakeholders, including you -- we haven't  decided anything yet and will not without taking the time and doing the  research that stewards of public infrastructure perform before making  changes.</p>
<p>(4)  is a corollary of (2) and (3): use CC licenses for data and databases  now, participate in the 4.0 process, and upgrade when the 4.0 suite is  released, or at least do not foreclose the possibility of doing so.</p>

<p><strong>By the way, what is data and what are databases?</strong></p>
<p>Oh right, those questions. I wonâ€™t try to answer too seriously, for that would require legal, technical, and <a href="http://web-and-philosophy.org/programme/en/">philosophical</a> dissertations. All information (including software and â€œcontentâ€) can  be thought of as data; more pertinently, data might be limited to  (uncopyrightable) facts, or it may include any arrangement of  information, e.g., in rows, tables, or graphs, including with  (copyrightable) creativity, and creative (copyrightable) arrangements of  information. Some kinds of arrangements and collections of information  are characterized as databases.</p>
<p>Data  and databases might contain what one would think of as content, e.g.,  prose contained in a database table. Data and databases might be  contained in what one would think of as content, e.g., the structured  information in Wikipedia, assertions waiting to be extracted from  academic papers, and annotated content on the web, intended first for  humans, but also structured for computers.</p>
<p>(Note that CC has been very interested in and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10095">worked toward</a> standards for mixing content and data -- apparently <a href="https://tripletalk.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/rdfa-deployment-across-the-web/">taking off</a> -- because such mixing is a good method for ensuring that content and  data are kept accurate, in sync, and usable -- for example, <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/ccrel-guide/">licensing and attribution information</a>.)</p>
<p>All  of this highlights the need for interoperability across â€œcontentâ€ and  â€œdataâ€, which means compatible (or the same) legal tools -- a good  reason for ensuring that CC licenses are the best tools for data,  databases and content -- indeed a mandate for ensuring this is the case.  Thanks in advance for your help (constructive criticism counts, as does  simply using our tools -- experience is the best guide) in fulfilling  this mandate.</p>
