<p>Creative Commons just reached an exciting milestone. As of this week, <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2012/07/heres-your-invite-to-reuse-and-remix-4.html">there are four million Creative Commons&#8211;licensed videos on YouTube</a>. That's over forty years&#8217; worth of footage to remix and reuse, all licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, the most permissive CC license.</p>
<p>One thing that makes this mass of CC-licensed content really exciting is that all four million of those videos can be imported into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/editor/">YouTube&#8217;s online video editor</a>. By letting people remix and adapt videos without having sophisticated editing software or expertise, YouTube and CC are making it easier for <i>anyone</i> to build on the work of others. And that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2012/07/heres-your-invite-to-reuse-and-remix-4.html">In her guest blog post on the YouTube blog</a>, CC CEO Cathy Casserly muses on what&#8217;s possible when YouTubers share their creativity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you need a professional opening for your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O2AesSSQco">San Francisco vacation video</a>? Perhaps some gorgeous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGeajqhMZJE">footage of the moon</a> for your science project? How about a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWacMwIsVMg">squirrel eating a walnut</a> to accompany your hot new dubstep track? All of this and more is available to inspire and add to your unique creation. Thanks to CC BY, it&#8217;s easy to borrow footage from other people&#8217;s videos and insert it into your own, because the license grants you the specific permissions to do so as long as you give credit to the original creator.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You can pass on the creative spirit when you publish your video, by choosing the option to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/creative_commons">license it under CC BY</a> so that others can reuse and remix your footage with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/editor">YouTube Video Editor</a>. This is where the fun really starts. Imagine seeing your footage used by a student in Mumbai, a filmmaker in Mexico City, or a music video director in Detroit. By letting other people play with your videos, you let them into a global sandbox, kicking off a worldwide team of collaborators. We all yearn to create and contribute&#160;&#8212; now you can join the fun, and open the door to collective imagination.</p></blockquote>
