<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/underbunny/">The photos of "underbunny"</a> show an artful, somber view of the world and offer a glimpse into what it's like to work at a mortuary. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=34279">This photo in particular</a> is quite powerful, telling the story of a life lived for 102 years. All the photos are available under a Creative Commons license, to boot.</p>
