<p>New Yorkers - next Thursday, February 26, <a href="http://www.wired.com/"><em>Wired</em></a> and <a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/pep/index.cfm">Live from the NYPL</a> will bring together <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, <a href="http://obeygiant.com/">Shepard Fairey</a>, and <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">Steven Johnson</a> for a discussion about Lessig's new book, <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594201721,00.html?Remix_Lawrence_Lessig"><em>Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy</em></a>. The conversation will take place at 7:00pm at the Celeste Bartos Forum at the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/">New York Public Library</a> (<a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/hours/chssdir.cfm">5th Avenue and 42nd Street</a>). <a href="https://www.smarttix.com/show.aspx?showCode=LAW">Tickets</a> are $25 for general admission and $15 for library donors, seniors, and students. This is Lessig's final planned public discussion of remix and copyright issues, before he he heads to Harvard to <a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2008/12.18/99-safra.html">direct</a> the <a href="http://www.ethics.harvard.edu/">Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics</a>. Lessig, Fairey, and Johnson will be on hand after the talk to sign their respective books and posters.</p>
<blockquote><p>LIVE from the NYPL and WIRED Magazine kick off the Spring 2009 season with a spirited discussion of the emerging remix culture. Our guides through this new worldâ€”who will take us from Jefferson's Bible to AndrÃ© the Giant to Wikipediaâ€”will be Lawrence Lessig, author of Remix, founder of Creative Commons, and one of the leading legal scholars on intellectual property issues in the Internet age; acclaimed street artist Shepard Fairey, whose iconic Obama "HOPE" poster was recently acquired by the National Portrait Gallery; and cultural historian Steven Johnson, whose new book, The Invention of Air, argues that remix culture has deep roots in the Enlightenment and among the American founding fathers.</p></blockquote>
