<p>NewsForge has <a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/03/16/2022232&from=rss">reviewed</a> ccPublisher 2 beta 1 (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5817">beta 2 is now available</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Beta 1 offers a sparse, straightforward interface. Follow a few prompts to select applicable files for upload, enter metadata for the Internet Archive listings, and select a CC license and the files' formats. The program uploads all the information to the Internet Archive, where it appears within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The ccPublisher 2 team plan several useful features for the official release, including complete conversion to the more modular and extensible ccPublisher 2 architecture, support for extensions and plugins, and easy customization for third-party developers.</p>
<p>The ccPublisher 2 developers have already set their sights on version 1.1, which they say will embed CC metadata into numerous formats and offer full support for localization. They also hope to allow users to extract existing metadata from the media files themselves, making the process much faster, particularly when uploading a large number of files.</p>
<p>The current ccPublisher 2 beta release is a useful, yet somewhat limited, application for Internet Archive publishing. But if its development road map is an indicator, ccPublisher 2 is set to become an invaluable tool in the future.</p>

<p>Thanks Sean "Nz17" Robinson of NewsForge! Note that ccPublisher 2.1 is the version that will include full localization. It is due for release, appropriately enough, during the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5842">iCommons</a> summit this summer.</p>
