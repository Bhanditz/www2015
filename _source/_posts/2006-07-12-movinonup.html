<p>Working for Creative Commons has been a great experience with one exception: the telecommuting.  I've realized over the past two years it's just not for me.  It's not so much the distance as it is being by myself all the time; I prefer to be around people when I'm working.  So when my former employer, <a href="http://canterburyschool.org">Canterbury School</a>, offered me a desk in their technology center where I could continue to work for Creative Commons, I jumped at the chance.  Canterbury School is one of the leading college preparatory schools in northeast Indiana and has a strong computer science requirement for high school students (including <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>).</p>

<p>  I've been working in the new office since Monday, and it's a nice change from working alone.  Thanks to Canterbury for supporting Creative Commons so generously.</p>
