<p><a href="http://www.wireless.is/rood/"><em>Roo'd</em></a>, a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA</a> licensed novel about "the future that's closer than we think" recently got added to the iPhone eBook reader repository, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iphoneebooks/">iphoneebooks</a>, making it the first modern novel therein.</p>
<p>By using a CC license, <a href="http://www.wireless.is/">Joshua Klein,</a> the author of <em>Roo'd</em>, opened the door for the free digital re-distribution of his novel, making it a legally sound choice for those who develop free and open applications that rely on creative content. As a result, <em>Roo'd</em>, Klein's first novel, is experiencing a broad level of exposure that would be difficult to attain for a first-time novelist (including some <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/11/18/cc-science-fiction-n.html">Boing Boing love</a>). For a relatively unknown author, this level of flexibility in exposure is huge - in talking about this unexpected publicity, Klein  <a href="http://www.wireless.is/rood/">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"If you've ever poured your heart and soul into writing a novel this is pretty much what your dream should be, and is a better endorsement for Creative Commons than anything I could have dreamed up."</p></blockquote>
