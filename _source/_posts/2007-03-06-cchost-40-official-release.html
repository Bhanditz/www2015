<p>We are proud to announce the official release of Creative Commons' open source remix community project ccHost 4.0 which is now available for immediate <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=156675">download and install</a> (it's actually version 4.0.1 so if you downloaded 4.0 or 4.0 RC1 then you should upgrade immediately to get the last minute bug fixes). More information about this important release <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7244">is here</a>.</p>
<p>Early adopters include the very important work being done by our friends at <a href="http://freeculture.org">freeculture</a> for their first <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7260">content collection project</a> for <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">One Laptop Per Child</a>. This installation is also technically interesting because the project's requirements were decidedly untypical (for ccHost), namely anonymous uploading and blog-style reviewing/commenting as well as pulling music files from other websites. With less than a week to go before they launched and working together with an impressive team of volunteers we were able to customize the installation with a minimal amount of additional scripting and no changes to the base ccHost installation. A technical challenge easily met by ccHost for a great cause. It doesn't get much better than this.</p>
