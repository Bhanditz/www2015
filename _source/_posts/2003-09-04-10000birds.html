Fans of the recent documentary hit movie "<a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/wingedmigration/">Winged Migration</a>" might be interested in following this week's featured content at <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/">the 10,000 Birds Blog</a>. Written by <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/team.htm">a small team of casual bird-watchers</a>, their goal is to document as many sightings of the roughly 10,000 bird species found in the world. So far, <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/birdlist.htm">they're up to 210</a>. After reading their site, I can't help but hope they make their goal and continue publishing their Creative Commons licensed updates far into the future.</p>
