<p>Please check out our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities/#controller">updated job posting for a full-time controller</a>. Amid our search for a senior accountant, we realized that this role will involve a higher level of responsibility and management skill. The person in this position will assume responsibility for all of our accounting and finance requirements, just as we finish our 2008 audit process. The controller will take the lead on maintaining and building CC's accounting and finance department.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage the accountant or assistant controller who is ready to be the sole financial expert for our 501c3 to apply by April 20.  The position would start ASAP.</p>
