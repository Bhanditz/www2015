<p><a href="http://www.generalfuzz.net/">General Fuzz</a>, an artist who creates self-described "lush melodic instrumental electronica", released his new album, <em><a href="http://www.generalfuzz.net/tunes.php">Soulful Filling</a></em>, at the beginning of this month, bringing his number of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> licensed albums to an amazing <strong>5</strong>. </p>
<p>All the tracks, along with General Fuzz's other music, are <a href="http://www.generalfuzz.net/tunes.php">free to download at his website</a>. What really sets <em>Soulful Filling</em> apart though, outside of its musical merit, is that General Fuzz has gone to the trouble of crafting a "multitrack flash mp3 player" that allows you to listen to a song's individual audio stems either on their own or as a user-defined composite. </p>
