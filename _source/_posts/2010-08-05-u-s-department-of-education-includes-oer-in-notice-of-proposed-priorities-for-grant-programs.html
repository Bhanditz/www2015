<p>Today the U.S. Department of Education took <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21054">another big step</a> in supporting open educational resources (OER). In theÂ Federal Register, the Department released aÂ <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/08/05/2010-19296/secretarys-priorities-for-discretionary-grant-programs">notice of proposed priorities</a> (NPP):</p>
<blockquote><p>The Secretary of Education proposes priorities that the Department of Education (Department) may use for any appropriate discretionary grant program in fiscal year (FY) 2011 and future years ... This action will permit all offices in the Department to use, as appropriate for particular discretionary grant programs, one or more of these priorities in any discretionary grant competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>The set of proposed priorities specifically mentions OER.Â Essentially, if the priorities are adopted, it could mean that grant seekers who include open educational resources as a component of an application for funding from the Department of Education could receive priority. OER is included in <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/08/05/2010-19296/secretarys-priorities-for-discretionary-grant-programs#h-28">Proposed Priority 13--Improving Productivity</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="p-82">Projects that are designed to significantly increase efficiency in the use of time, staff, money, or other resources. Such projects may include innovative and sustainable uses of technology, modification of school schedules, use of open educational resources (as defined in this notice), or other strategies that improve results and increase productivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, the NPP includes a <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/08/05/2010-19296/secretarys-priorities-for-discretionary-grant-programs#p-106">definition of open educational resources</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Open educational resources (OER)Â means teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use or repurposing by others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interested parties may submit comments to the notice of proposed priorities until September 7, 2010. Information about how to submit a comment is <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/08/05/2010-19296/secretarys-priorities-for-discretionary-grant-programs#addresses">described in the notice</a>.</p>
