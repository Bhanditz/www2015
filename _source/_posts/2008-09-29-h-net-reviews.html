<p><a href="http://www.h-net.org/about/">H-Net</a> is "an international consortium of scholars and teachers...[creating] and [coordinating]Â Internet networks with the common objective of advancing teaching and research in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. H-Net is committed to pioneering the use of new communication technology to facilitate the free exchange of academic ideas and scholarly resources." Recently, H-Net took a step towards facilitating this free exchange by licensing their <a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/">online scholarly reviews</a> of various books in the humanities and social sciences <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>. Normally, scholarly reviews take a while to come out in print journals, so the online reviewing system of H-Net is effective in not only providing timely access to these reviews but also in stimulating response and discussion via their discussion networks, where each review is also published.Â </p>
<p>ccLearn supports this step towards increasing openness and hopes for greater progress from H-Net in the future. MIT Press also recently licensed their publication, "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9551">Opening Up Education: The Collective Advancement of Education through Open Technology, Open Content, and Open Knowledge</a>," CC BY-NC-ND---but unfortunately the No Derivatives term prevents remixing and adaptation for different contexts and needs. The ability to change and build on educational resources is a freedom that educators, students and researchers find not only incredibly useful but integral to the nature of their work. We hope to see more in this vein from both <a href="http://www.h-net.org/">H-Net</a> and <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11309">MIT Press</a> in the future!</p>
