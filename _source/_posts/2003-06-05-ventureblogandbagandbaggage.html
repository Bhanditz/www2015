<p>We've have been enjoying the content on <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/">VentureBlog</a> and <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/">Bag and Baggage</a> for some time, but recently both of these Creative Commons licensed blogs did a great job covering The Wall Street Journal's <a href="http://d.wsj.com">D: All Things Digital Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to some restrictions on the conference, <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001058.shtml#001058">professional journalists were not allowed to cover the event</a>, but audience members could. <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/cat_conferences.html">VentureBlog had some great insights</a> to take away from the conference and  Bag and Baggage did a great job taking live notes from <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2003_05_25_bgbg_archive.html#200366681">the Steve Jobs interview</a> and the <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2003_05_25_bgbg_archive.html#200363314">dinner with Bill Gates</a>, and also posted <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2003_05_25_bgbg_archive.html#200353432">photos from the event</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the recent reporting, each blog has content worthy of merit. VentureBlog is <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/contributors.html#hornik">run by venture capital firm investors</a> and their series of posts on <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/cat_presenting_your_company.html">Presenting Your Company</a> offers many useful insider tips. We've pointed to Denise at Bag and Baggage before on this weblog, but her posts on <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2002_12_15_bgbg_archive.html#90079883">what Creative Commons licenses mean for weblog authors</a> were instructive for the community.</p>
