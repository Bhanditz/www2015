<p>This year Creative Commons will once again be participating in the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code</a>.  Summer of Code is a program generously sponsored by Google which pays college students to work on open source projects.  The application period for students begins Monday, March 24 and is open through Monday, March 31 (a <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html#0.1_timeline">complete schedule</a> is available).  </p>
<p>We have some <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summer_of_Code_2008">background information</a> in the wiki, including project ideas.  I'm personally really hoping for a ground-up rewrite of the validator (<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Rewrite_Metadata_Validator">project suggestions</a>).  Our list of ideas is small, so let your imagination run wild; if you have questions about an ideas we're happy to answer your questions on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/IRC">IRC</a> or the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Mailing_Lists">cc-devel</a> mailing list.</p>
