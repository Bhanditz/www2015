<p>Come celebrate open source, the open web, and the commons with CC and Mozilla on Wed. July 25th in Portland, OR. Several of the CC and Mozilla crew will be venturing out of San Francisco in order to attend the Open Source Convention (OSCON) and saw this as the perfect opportunity to bring our communities together in real time. Did I mention that <a href="http://www.menomena.com">Menomena</a>, an experimental rock band from Portland will be playing? Awesome.</p>
<p>Details:<br />
Date:  July 25, 2007<br />
Time:  Doors open at 6:30 but feel free to come after the party on the Expo Floor. Band starts around 8:30.<br />
Location: <a href="http://wonderballroom.com">The Wonder Ballroom</a></p>
