Sounds good in Spanish, too. <a href="http://www.clarin.com/diario/2003/10/24/t-646226.htm">Here's an article</a> from <a href="http://www.clarin.com">Clarin.com</a> on Creative Commons and director <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#2">James Boyle</a>'s recent visit to Argentina. The piece doesn't quite get how Creative Commons's approach is reliant upon and compatible with copyright, but it's nice to see another example of interest in our work building across the world.</p>
