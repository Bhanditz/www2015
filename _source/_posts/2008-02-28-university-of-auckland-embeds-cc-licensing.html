<p>The <a href="http://auckland.ac.nz/">University of Auckland</a> has just announced that they have embedded Creative Commons licensing for all new submissions by PhD students into the university's digital repository, <a href="http://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/">ResearchSpace</a>.</p>
<p>From the repository's librarian Leonie Hayes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"At the moment the showcase collection is PhD theses, there are nearly 800 in the PhD collection, most are open access. There are another 900 awaiting signoff from authors. When new graduates submit online they have a choice of adding a CC licence along with their consent for a digital copy.</p>
<p>We are also investigating application of Creative Commons licenses to our other digital collections."</p></blockquote>
