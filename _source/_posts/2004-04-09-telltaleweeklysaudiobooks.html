<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/technology/circuits/08diar.html">A New York Times article</a> recently pointed to <a href="http://telltaleweekly.com/">Tell Tale Weekly</a>, an audio book site selling MP3s as cheap as $0.25 each. They've also committed to licensing the books under a Creative Commons license after 5 years or 100k downloads, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>It's not easy to find good, cheap, DRM-free audiobooks and Tell Tale Weekly looks like a pretty cool new provider of such work.</p>
