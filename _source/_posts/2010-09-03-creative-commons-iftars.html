<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://arabic.creativecommons.org/page/dubai">Dubai</a> became the first Arab city to celebrate a <a href="http://arabic.creativecommons.org/cciftar">Creative Commons Iftar</a>. It will be followed tomorrow by <a href="http://arabic.creativecommons.org/page/amman">Amman</a>, <a href="http://arabic.creativecommons.org/page/damascus">Damascus</a> on September 5, and <a href="http://arabic.creativecommons.org/page/cairo">Cairo</a> on September 7.  </p>
<p>The iftar is the meal that breaks the fast of Muslims during the month of Ramadan. In the Arab world, it is traditionally associated with families sitting all together and enjoying the first meal of the day. CC Iftars, moreover, are social events where people celebrate the breaking of the fast, socialize, and talk about innovation, creativity, and the open web. The meetings are cozy, informal, and community-driven. They can feature lightning talks, engaging presentations, film screenings, or live remixes of CC-licensed works.</p>
<p>CC Iftars have been organized thanks to the great efforts of our Arab world communities, led by volunteer teams in Dubai, Amman, Damascus and Cairo. Each city's iftar focuses on a different theme. In Dubai, it's â€œmash-ups,â€ Amman's is â€œfast-sharing,â€ Damascus's is â€œremix!â€ and Cairo's is â€œshare!â€  Guests include educators, media professionals, artists, technologists, students, and members of the local CC jurisdiction teams. Each program is filled with performances, screenings, inspiring talks, and debates. The local volunteer teams have done a fantastic job pulling together the programs, finding speakers, and designing event t-shirts. In some cases, like in Dubai and Amman, there are themed competitions as well. </p>
<p>A big thank you to Aramex, who has been our incredible regional partner and supports the iftars in each city.</p>
<p>Best of luck to the teams in Dubai, Amman, Damascus, and Cairo. We hope you'll be able to join them, break the fast, and share ideas! </p>
