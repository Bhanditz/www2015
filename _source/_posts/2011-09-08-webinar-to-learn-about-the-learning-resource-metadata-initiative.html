<p>The Association of Educational Publishers (AEP) and Creative Commons are hosting a <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/985113857">webinar</a> to introduce publishers, content developers, educators, and the general public to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LRMI/FAQ">Learning Metadata Resource Initiative (LRMI)</a>. Many of you read about its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27603">launch</a> in June, and maybe even saw that the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28719">Technical Working Group</a> had been finalized and is starting work. This <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/985113857">webinar</a> is the first in a series of webinars on the LRMI, and is a chance for you to get your questions answered directly. Official description:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Metadata Tagging in Education â€“ What Every Publisher and Content Developer Needs to Know </strong></p>
<p>Join AEP and Creative Commons to learn about the effort to establish a common vocabulary for describing learning resources. This webinar will review the background of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative, the roles of the organizations involved, and the goals for this major initiative.  As a framework is created and then adopted by publishers and content developers, many opportunities lie ahead. Weigh in, ask your questions, voice your concerns, and help us keep the dialogue moving forward. The Learning Resource Metadata Initiative will have a valuable impact on the way educators search for and use online educational material.</p></blockquote>
<p>The webinar will occur on Friday, September 23, 2011 at 2:00-3:00 PM U.S. EDT. <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/985113857">Register</a> now!</p>
