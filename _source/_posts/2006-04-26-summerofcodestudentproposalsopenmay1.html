<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5857">previously announced</a> Creative Commons is participating in Google's Summer of Code as a mentoring organization.  Please visit our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summer_of_Code_2006">summer of code ideas page</a> and if you're a student, start working on a proposal.</p>
<blockquote><p>An <em>over-the-top ideal</em> proposal would include support for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RDFa">RDFa</a>, remixing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format" rel="tag">open formats</a> and affordances for educational and worldwide (not just wealthy regions) use. Ability to release under an open source license and incorporation of some Creative Commons affordance are necessary. However, a solid proposal is far more important than buzzword compliance.  Please read Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/studentfaq.html">Summer of Code Student FAQ</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summer_of_Code_2006#Writing_Proposals">advice from past participants</a> as you create your proposal. Good luck!</p></blockquote>
<p>Coincidentally Chris DiBona, Google's <a href="http://code.google.com">Open Source Programs Manager</a>, will be speaking at the next <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC Salon San Francsico</a> on May 10, two days <em>after</em> the SoC student proposal submission period ends.</p>
