<p>Creative Commons Hungary,together with the band Nomada and Tilos Radio, are holding their first remix contest in Hungary, inviting people to remix a track from the bank Nomada. The five-member group Nomada was founded by Roma singer-guitarist Balogh GusztÃ¡v in 2003. Nomadaâ€™s music is derived from the Hungarian Gypsy tradition in addition to drawing from other musical styles such as Spanish, Arabic and Serbian folk elements.</p>
<p>Nomada have released their song Aven le Roma! â€“ Here come the Roma!, and its component elements, under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license which authorizes members of the public to remix it. To be considered as part of the content, remixes must be uploaded to this site by March 31, 2006. Six of the best remixes will be selected by panel of Hungarian and international musicians including DJ Vadim, Szakcsi Lakatos BÃ©la, Mitsou and Dj Palotai.</p>
<p>The Hungarian remix contest comes in the wake of the release by the Hungary's Acting Prime Minister</p>
