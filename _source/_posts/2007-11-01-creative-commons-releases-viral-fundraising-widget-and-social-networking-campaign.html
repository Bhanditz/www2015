<p>Last year Creative Commons utilized an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6125">innovative fundraising model</a> by using the video sharing platform <a href="http://www.revver.com/">Revver</a> to disseminate the Creative Commons mission and to help raise funds for the Creative Commonsâ€™ second annual fundraising campaign. That experience demonstrated the strength of CCâ€™s community and that viral fundraising is key to sustaining Creative Commons.</p>
<p>This year Creative Commons has added a Web 2.0 â€œwidgetâ€ and a Facebook initiative to its viral fundraising arsenal. The <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/widget">widget</a> embeds directly in blogs, websites and MySpace. The text is customizable so people can encourage others to give in their own words. This easy to use tool enables people to more directly participate in raising awareness and funds for Creative Commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bethkanter.org/">Beth Kanter</a>, professional blogger and consultant on the use of social media tools in the nonprofit sector for social change saysâ€¦ â€œI can't wait to remix the Creative Commons widget and use it to help fundraise on my blog and social networking profiles.  This is perfect way to celebrate what Creative Commons stands for and help raise funds for the annual fund campaign!â€</p>
<p>Creative Commons has also launched fundraising in Facebook using the â€œCausesâ€ Facebook app.  All of Creative Commonsâ€™ viral fundraising tools, including the widget, Facebook, videos, and other forms of social media sharing, are available on their <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/spread">website</a>.</p>
