<p><a href="http://icommons.org/contributors/rebecca-kahn/">Rebecca Kahn</a> from <a title="iCommons.org" href="http://icommons.org">iCommons.org</a> is asking for people to <a href="mailto:bekka.kahn@gmail.com">send her images directly</a> wishing a happy birthday to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7142">Creative Commons for its 4th birthday celebration tomorrow, December 15 - 16</a>, depending on which <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_party#Parties">timezone you are in</a>. Along witht he photo, she wants people to send a nice message to CC. You could also save time and post them to your <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr.com</a> account, pick a <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/">Creative Commons license for the image</a>, and tag it with "creativecommons" and "bday" to speed up the process. Oh, and don't forget to send her the URL if you go that route :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The <a href="mailto:bekka.kahn@gmail.com">email link</a> is fixed above.</p>
