<p><a href="http://label.pubspaces.com/">PublicSpacesLab</a>, a CC-using netlabel, recently launched "<a href="http://label.pubspaces.com/?p=321">Music for Freedom</a>", a project that encourages musicians (and non-musicians) to engage with the Iranian election through online collaboration. Co-sponsored by CC-content directories <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a> and <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">Indaba Music</a>, the "Music For Freedom" project is aggregating samples of the word 'freedom' spoken by their community in a variety of languages. These samples are then then imported to <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/sessions/fjfonseca/119644">a collaborative Indaba session</a> where a community of musicians is collaborating on a singular piece.</p>
<p>The final mixdown will be released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA license</a> - you can join the conversation <a href="http://label.pubspaces.com/?p=333">here</a>.</p>
