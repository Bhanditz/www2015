<p>We're at a very exciting time in the life of CC. We had a great year last year, and as you'll read in <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/newsletter/ccnewsletter11.pdf">this newsletter</a>, CC is poised for even more growth and success in 2009 &mdash; in the realms of education, science, culture, internationally, and more.</p>
<p>February also marks the one-year anniversary since the <a href="http://philippinecommons.org/">CC Philippines team</a> first began designing the stunning <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCNewsletter">PDF versions</a> of the newsletter. As always, many thanks to CC Philippines for the lovely work!</p>
