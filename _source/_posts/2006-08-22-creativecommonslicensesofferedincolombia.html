<p><b>San Francisco, CA, USA; Berlin, GERMANY; and BogotÃ¡, Colombia â€” August 22, 2006</b> â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon today announced the launch of its licenses in Colombia.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the groupâ€™s <a href="http://creativecommons.org">website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with project leads Carolina Botero, AndrÃ©s UmaÃ±a, Jaime Rojas and Alfredo Vargas in Colombia to adapt the standardized licenses to Colombian law. Creative Commons Colombia (whose website will be available shortly  <a href="http://co.creativecommons.org">here</a>) was hosted by <a href="http://www.urosario.edu.co">Universidad del Rosario - Colombia</a>.</p>
<p>â€œThe Colombian version of the Creative Commons licenses will be launched in a one day session Program being held during the morning at Universidad PolitÃ©cnico Grancolombiano, Professor Lawrence Lessig of Stanford University, CEO & Chairman of Creative Commons, will deliver the keynote speech on the importance of the launch of the CC licenses in Colombiaâ€ says AndrÃ©s UmaÃ±a.</p>
<p>â€œLater in the evening a special open content session will be held in the Virgilio Barco Public Library with the participation of Colombian artists. All sessions will be webcasted vÃ­a Renata (Colombian Network of Universities) and/or using free streaming via Internet, to allow everyone around Colombia to participateâ€, adds Alfredo Vargas.</p>
<p>â€œCC has turned to be an important reference point in vital sectors like education, science and journalism where the commons approach has a strong influence, we will show examples of Colombian experiences in the adoption of CC licenses that we believe are important steps for free culture in South America and even in a more global contextâ€ points Carolina Botero.</p>
<p>â€œWe believe CC will provide Colombians a new medium to express ourselves bringing us closer to Latin America and the world with all the amazing talents this country has through its rich artistic heritage, biodiversity and imagination. CC will also enhance the open access that is going to have a direct impact (publicly and privately) in the: cultural, scientific, entrepreneurial and education sectors. This is a success for the community we built around the project, and it is a big step for Colombian creatorsâ€, adds Jaime Rojas.</p>
