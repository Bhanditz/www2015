<a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/">Bloomsbury Publishing</a>, one of Europe's leading independent publishing houses (you may have heard of their fiction series <em>Harry Potter</em>, among other fantastic fiction and non-fiction titles) <a href="http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/news.htm">announced today</a> that it is launching an CC-exclusive publishing imprint called <a href="http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/index.html">Bloomsbury Academic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All books will be made available free of charge online, with free downloads, for non-commercial purposes immediately upon publication, using Creative Commons licences. The works will also be sold as books, using the latest short-run technologies or Print on Demand (POD).</p>
<p>The imprint will initially publish in the Social Sciences and Humanities building thematic lists on pressing global issues, with approximately fifty new titles online and in print by the end of 2009.

<p>Congratulations and thanks go to Bloomsbury for continuing the tradition of open access in Europe by choosing our licenses for their new imprint.</p>
