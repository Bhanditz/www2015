<p>Creative Commons is now offering <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/livecontent" title="LiveContent">LiveContent</a> through the Open Source product distribution service <a href="http://www.on-disk.com/" title="On-Disk.com">On-Disk.com</a>. On-Disk sells a variety of software packages conveniently contained on a CD or DVD. On-Disk provides "burn-on-demand" service and works with open source and smaller software and media developers -- "helping low-budget or no-budget organizations publish their software and digital media products with no out of pocket expenses."</p>
<p>On-Disk is currently carrying <a href="http://on-disk.com/product_info.php/cPath/28_191/products_id/387" title="LiveContent 1.0 at On-Disk">LiveContent 1.0</a> and will roll in <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LiveContent_2_0" title="LiveContent 2.0">2.0</a> upon its release. In addition to CC's distros, the site offers various flavors of Linux as well as educational and productivity applications. On-Disk aims to support the non-technophiles among us by helping bridge technology gaps:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We tend to assume everyone can download, install or stream live media. However, a large percentage of computer users have trouble with basic operations. Offering a CD or DVD increases the number of people able to participate."</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, users can still download the CC LiveContent ISO for free from the <a href="http://spins.fedoraproject.org/" title="Fedora Project Spins ">Fedora site</a> and then burn the image to a disc.</p>
