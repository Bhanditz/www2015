Creative Commons chairman Lawrence Lessig has just released his new book, <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">Free Culture</a> today, both <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/">online as a licensed downloadable PDF</a> and <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/get-it/">in stores</a>. The book covers the current state of copyright law and what it means to our culture and society. Give it a look, and if you like what you see, <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/get-it/">ordering online</a> will contribute a small percentage of this organization.</p>
