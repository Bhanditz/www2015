<p>John Panzer of AOL has been <a href="http://journals.aol.com/panzerjohn/abstractioneer/entries/1338">writing about feed licensing</a>.  His recommendation:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, here's my new summary, which is shorter but more complicated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support and promote <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Syndication">feed standards for embedded licenses</a>.</li>
<li>Allow fair use for unlicensed feed content.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll need to consult your legal department on what fair use is in each case, and figure out how to deal with international jurisdictions too.</p>
<p>All of which makes embedding licenses in feeds even more important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks John for linking to our page on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Syndication">license discovery in feeds</a>, which references license metadata standards for RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 and describes heuristics for finding licensing information when not included directly in a feed.</p>
<p>If you're a developer of feed-publishing software (most obviously blog software, but everything produces feeds these days) please consider including license metadata in published feeds.  If you're a developer of feed-consuming software (most obviously feed readers and aggregators) please consider making license information user visible.</p>
