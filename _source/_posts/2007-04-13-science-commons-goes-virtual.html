<p>John Wilbanks will be giving a talk in the virtual world <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> this Monday (4/16). Taking on avatar-form for his first official SL speaking engagement, Wilbanks will be giving an introduction to Science Commons. The talk - "Scientific Research and the Creative Commons Methodology" - will shed light on the application of CC copyright licenses in a research context for science. The talk will also examine the application of CC methods such as standard human-readable contracts and technology implementations of contracts to non-digital materials (such as DNA, stem cells, research animals).</p>
<p>An avatar is required to attend this lecture, which can be acquired for free on <a href="http://secondlife.com">Second Life's Web site</a>.</p>
<p>The event will take place at the <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Info%20Island%20II/115/204/25">Science Center on Info Island II</a> at 1 p.m. EST/ 10 a.m. SL time.<code></code></p>
