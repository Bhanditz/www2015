<p><b>New Vocal Samples from Chuck D and George Clinton Made Available for Use</b></p>
<p>
San Francisco, CA, USA â€“ February 15, 2006</p>
<p>
Creative Commons, along with filmmakers Kembrew McLeod and Ben Franzen, today announced that due to overwhelmingly positive response, the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/copyrightcriminals/view/contest/about"><i>Copyright Criminals</i> Remix Contest</a> has been extended by two weeks, ending on March 14. Additionally, new vocal samples from influential rapper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_D">Chuck D</a> (of <a href="http://www.publicenemy.com/">Public Enemy</a>) and pioneering funk musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_%28funk_musician%29">George Clinton</a> (of <a href="http://www.georgeclinton.com/">Parliament-Funkadelic</a>) have been made available for use in the competition.</p>
<p>
Winners will be chosen according to the same criteria as originally announced; no other contest details are changed.</p>
<p>
The <i>Copyright Criminals</i> Remix Contest encourages producers, DJs, and remixers from around the world to use audio snippets from the upcoming documentary film <a href="http://www.copyrightcriminals.com/"><i>Copyright Criminals</i></a> in new, original songs. One winner will have his/her music featured prominently in the final edit of <i>Copyright Criminals</i>. The winning track, along with 11 runners-up, will be included on the film's companion CD. The contest is going on now at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter.org</a>.</p>
<p>
Drawing from more than fifty interviews with prominent musicians, artists, scholars, lawyers, and music industry representatives, <i>Copyright Criminals</i> looks at the development of sound collage (also known as sampling). The film explores the complicated impact that copyright law has had on the creative practice of sampling and studies the conflicting opinions artists and others have about appropriation.</p>
<p>
Samples of dialogue by artists like De La Soul, DJ Qbert, Matmos, Coldcut, and members of Negativland â€“ all taken from interviews conducted for <i>Copyright Criminals</i> â€“ are available online at the popular remix community ccMixter.org for use as source material to be included in entrants' songs. Entries will be judged by McLeod, Franzen, and author/producer Jeff Chang. Contest rules and details are available at ccMixter.org.</p>
