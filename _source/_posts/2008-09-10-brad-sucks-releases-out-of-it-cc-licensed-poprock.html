<p><a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/">Brad Sucks</a>, a CC-staff favorite musician, released his new album <em><a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/albums/out_of_it/">Out Of It</a></em> this past Monday online, for free, and under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA license</a>. From the <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/2008/09/08/out-of-it/">Brad Sucks blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lotâ€™s changed since I started putting music on the Internet way back in 2001. Artist-endorsed free downloads were shocking. Flexible pricing was still an untested novelty. It was rare to find source files from artists and sharing music wasnâ€™t encouraged by new artists.</p>
<p>Recently I was asked if Iâ€™d do anything different this time around [...] and I honestly couldnâ€™t imagine why Iâ€™d do things different. The only reason I, a dude who made an album by himself in a country basement, has had any sort of success is because people took it upon themselves to share my music with their friends. They remixed it, they used it in their videos, they played it on their podcasts, they included it in software and games and it took on a life of its own.</p></blockquote>
<p>To coincide with the album release, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> got Randy Chertkow and Jason Feehan, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8756">authors of the "Indie Band Survival Guide"</a> to conduct <a href="http://ccmixter.org/artist-spotlight-q-a?topic=brad-sucks">an interview</a> with Brad Sucks. Brad is <a href="http://ccmixter.org/stats">one of the most sampled</a> artists over at ccMixter and the interview sheds much more light on his music in particular and opinions on the music industry as a whole.</p>
