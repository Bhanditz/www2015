<p>Creative Commons has recently expanded the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">iCommons</a> project further to include <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/hr/">Croatian</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/es/">Spanish</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/es-ca/">Catalan</a> drafts in progress. They join the other jurisdictions in the effort to port Creative Commons licenses to the framework of international law. Every country has <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss">an ongoing discussion</a> so if you're interested in helping bring the licenses to these places, feel free to join in. The associated <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/4015">press</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/4014">releases</a> are also online.</p>
