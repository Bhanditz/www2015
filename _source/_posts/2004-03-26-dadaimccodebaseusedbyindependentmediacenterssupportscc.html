<p><a href="http://www.dadaimc.org/">dadaIMC</a>, a content management system that offer a codebase for the operation of Independent Media Center sites, now supports Creative Commons licenses for users <a href="http://baltimore.indymedia.org/newswire/index.php?function=publish">uploading content</a> to the system.  There are currently twenty eight Independent Media Center sites that run on dadaIMC.</p>
<p>
Independent Media Centers, like the one in <a href="http://baltimore.indymedia.org/">Baltimore</a>, are based on a philosophy of open publishing. Their newswire is open to public use, and anyone can post articles, audio, video, or images to the site. The interface for posting media includes<br />
a section for selecting  between<br />
copyright, public domain, or any of the Creative Commons licenses.  dadaIMC has also innovated to offer a new logo that explicity signals the allowance of derivative works, something our current license engine doesn't support.</p>
