<p><img src="img/logo_on_white.png" alt="logo_on_white" width="351" height="53" style="float:right;padding:10px" /><a href="http://bandcamp.mu/">Bandcamp</a>, a <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1739268">feature-heavy</a> music site that focuses on providing musicians with robust, easy-to-use, and visually pleasing artist pages, <a href="http://blog.bandcamp.mu/2009/01/19/on-the-expansion-of-creativity-in-the-commons/">just integrated</a> CC licensing options in to their UI:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hugs and kisses backatchu JD, and everyone else who requested Creative Commons support, then patiently worked around its absence by putting CC links in their tracksâ€™ credits or about fields, slapping CC marks in their header graphics, and other reasonable zaniness. Situation rectified: starting today, you can select a CC license right from the Edit Track page.</p>
<p>[...]<br />
Creative Commonsâ€™ mission is â€œto increase the amount of creativityâ€¦ in â€˜the commonsâ€™ â€” the body of work that is available to the public for free and legal sharing, use, repurposing, and remixing.â€ A worthy goal, we think, so if Â© strikes you as too restrictive, we hope youâ€™ll take a gander at the various licenses and find something that better captures the freedoms you want your work to carry.</p></blockquote>
<p>At a basic level, we aim to have licensing be as simple and easy as possible, a goal that is more fully accomplished when content-sharing sites like Bandcamp integrate CC license options directly into their UI. Kudos to Bandcamp for the integration and much thanks to all the Bandcamp users who requested it in the first place.
