<p><span style="xx-small;">Market Street, Sydney | <a title="Flickr Commons usage terms" href="http://www.flickr.com/commons/usage/">No known copyright restrictions.</a></span></p>
<p>The <a title="Powerhouse Museum" href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/">Powerhouse Museum</a> in Sydney, Australia has become the first museum in the world to release publicly-held historical photographs for access on the <a title="Flickr Commons project" href="http://www.flickr.com/commons">Flickr: The Commons</a>. Powerhouse has released an initial 200 photographs from its <a title="Powerhouse Tyrrell Collection" href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/tyrrell/">Tyrrell Collection</a>, and will continue to add more from this 7900+ image collection over the coming weeks. The Powerhouse Museum joins the <a title="Library of Congress" href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a> in the 'Commons' initiative. The Library of Congress is sharing over <a title="LOC on Flickr Commons" href="http://flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/">3,300 photos</a> from its vast collection on the Flickr site.</p>
<blockquote><p>The key goals of The Commons are to firstly give you a taste of the hidden treasures in the world's public photography archives, and secondly to show how your input and knowledge can help make these collections even richer. You're invited to help describe the photographs you discover in The Commons on Flickr, either by adding tags or leaving comments</p></blockquote>
