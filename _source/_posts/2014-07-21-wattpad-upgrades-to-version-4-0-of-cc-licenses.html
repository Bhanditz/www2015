<p><a href="http://www.wattpad.com/"><img src="img/wattpad-250.png" style="width: 250px; height: 73px; float: right; border: 0px; padding: 4px; " /></a>Fiction-writing community Wattpad has upgraded to the Creative Commons <a href="/version4">Version 4.0 licenses</a> and unveiled several improvements to its CC implementation. As of today, there are 300,000 CC-licensed stories on Wattpad, making this one of the largest adoptions of Version 4.0 to date.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The biggest question facing new writers today isn't how to protect their work; it's how to find a readership for it, said Cory Doctorow, science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger. "It makes complete sense that so many Wattpad writers are gravitating toward Creative Commons licenses: by giving others permission to share your writing, you can open doors to new audiences and new creative opportunities." Cory Doctorow has shared five stories on Wattpad under CC licenses, including New York Times best-selling novels <em>Homeland</em> and <em>Little Brother</em>. Today, to coincide with the roll out of CC 4.0, he will share his first novel <em>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</em> on Wattpad.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"All knowledge and culture owes something to what came before it - it's this public commons of ideas that forms the foundation of our society," said Creative Commons CEO Ryan Merkley. "I'm excited that the Wattpad community will have Creative Commons' simple, free tools to share their work, to re-use the works of others, and to contribute to the global creative community."</p></blockquote>
