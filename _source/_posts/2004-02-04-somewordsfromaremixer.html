<p>Victor Stone writes a <a href="http://virtualturntable.biz/archives/000107.php">remixer-readable</a> description on how the new Creative Commons Sampling license compares to our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses">standard licenses</a>.  He also mentions that it's important to have format specific metdata, so that search engines can find Creative Commons licensed audio, as opposed to text, images, or video.  This way remixers can easily find sounds they can remix legally, rather than having to wade through a mass of content.</p>
<p>You get format specific metadata when you <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license">choose a license</a> and designate what format your content is in.  We'll soon launch a seach engine that reads this metadata so that you can find works to use as part of your own creations. Unfortunately, currently no major search engine offers this service.</p>
