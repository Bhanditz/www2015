<p><a href="http://www.youtils.com">Youtils</a> is an online service that enables content owners to track how their online images are being used on sites hosting their content. Right now, the site supports our Creative Commons Attribution license. When you <a href="http://www.youtils.com/signup.html">sign up and upload your images as an owner</a>, you can see interesting metrics such as where images and photos are published, the frequency in which they are accessed, and which images are most popular amongst images offered for reuse. </p>
<p>Thanks for adding another useful tool to the commons, <a href="http://www.youtils.com/">Youtils</a>!</p>
