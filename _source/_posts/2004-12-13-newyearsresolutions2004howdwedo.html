<p>At the turn of 2004, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3957">we laid out</a> our New Year's Resolutions for Creative Commons. The year's not quite up, but I'm going offline soon, so I thought it would be a good time to check in on our progress. I'm happy to report that the state of the Commons is strong. (If I personally had accomplished this many of my own New Year's Resolutions this year, I'd be a rich, talented, patient, cancer-curing, movie star-dating, Pulitzer-winning upstanding citizen by now. As it is . . . there's always next year.)</p>
<p><b>Make worry-free <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/sampling">sampling and re-creativity</a> mainstream.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">Sixteen sampling-friendly tunes</a> -- including the Beastie Boys, David Byrne, Gilberto Gil, Chuck D and more -- on the cover of WIRED magazine is a good start, yes?</p>
<p><b>Make 25 country-specific sets of iCommons licenses available.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/">Right now</a> we offer 11, and by the end of the January we'll offer 14. Another 12-15 are poised to go live very soon. Given that the 25-country figure was a little bit nuts (2 sets of licenses per month), iCommons progress has been a massive success and easily one of the most exciting things we've done. Hats off to Christiane, Roland, and all the iCommons volunteers worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Explore Science Commons.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://science.creativecommons.org/">Underway</a>. Much more coming at the turn of 2005.</p>
<p><b>Version licenses.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216">Done</a>, and thanks to you, a huge improvement.</p>
<p><b>Begin Save-a-Book campaign, revive out-of-print books.</b></p>
<p>This got shelved for the time being, though some planning has gotten underway.</p>
<p><b>Debut metadata search engine prototype.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/search">Done</a>. And it ships with the amazing <a href="http://http://mozilla.org">Firefox browser</a>. We are all indebted to Mike, Neeru, Matt, and <a href="http://nutch.org">Nutch.org</a>.
<p><b>Unveil CC-Mixter -- Friendster for musicians.</b></p>
<p>Done, and on the verge of some very cool applications -- watch this space this week.</p>
<p><b>Launch "Anatomy of a Film" project.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://fourthwall.creativecommons.org/">Done</a>. More interesting uses of this approach soon.</p>
<p><b>Build licenses into at least two applications per medium: photography, audio, film, text. (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html">Adobe XMP</a> plug-in to debut soon.)</b>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/ccapps">Let's see</a>: Flickr, SnapGallery, Moveable Type, Squarespace, Manila, Archive.org, YMDI, Ticketstubs, WinkSite, plus DMusic, Soundclick, Garageband.com, and others I'm sure I've forgotten. Great progress thanks to the tech team and Neeru.</p>
<p><b>Make "some rights reserved" household phrase.</b></p>
<p>Not quite household, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22some+rights+reserved%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">800,000 Google</a> hits isn't too bad.</p>
<p>We'll put up our 2005 Resolutions just after the New Year.</p></p></p>
