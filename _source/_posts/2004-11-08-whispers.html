<p>I've just heard from the curiously named jazz group <a href="http://www.whisperingj.addr.com/">Whispering Johnson</a>, who have released their latest recordings, <em>The Birthday Numbers</em>, under the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/">Sampling Plus</a> license. They've even gone out of their way to license their sheet music under CC -- nice touch. (Which segues into a nice reminder to all you music folk out there: if you're CC licensing a song of yours, be sure to license both the composition and the recording, if you're able to, so that your fans know they can make the most of both aspects of your stuff without legal woes.)</p>
<p>Shout it from the rooftops, or just use your inside voice: you're invited to sample Whispering Johnson.</p>
<p>(I should have known that Xeni from Boing Boing <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004/10/25/creative_commons_lic.html">beat me to the punch</a> on this.)</p>
