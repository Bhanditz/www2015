<p><a href="http://www.copyright.com/">CopyrightÂ ClearanceÂ Center</a> has just launched <a href="http://ozmo.com/">Ozmo</a>, a new web-based service focused on helping photographers, bloggers, and other content creators license their work for commercial use. Ozmo supports Creative Commons' <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+</a> protocol (see the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7919">press release</a> about CC+ for more information), meaning that it enables creators to license their work to the public under one set of terms via a Creative Commons license, and offer the ability to obtain a private license via Ozmo's licensing system -- to purchase rights not offered by the CC license a work is under (e.g., commercial use if the work is under a CC NonCommercial license, the right to make an adaptation and not share under the same license if the work is under a CC ShareAlike license, or the right to use without attribution), or simply to obtain a private agreement with the copyright holder for situations that require such. </p>
<p>To use Ozmo, a creator sets up an account, selects licenseÂ terms, andÂ sets a priceÂ forÂ theÂ useÂ of their work. Ozmo then works as a broker to companies,Â publishers, and bloggers who are looking to use work commercially. Ozmo manages the licensing process and pays creators when a license to their content is purchased. You can find more details about how Ozmo works on the site's <a href="http://ozmo.com/about">About</a> page.</p>
<p>Artist, animator, and filmmaker <a href="http://junell.net/">Ryan Junell</a> (who is the designer behind the Creative Commons logo, as well as several of CC's explanatory videos - see <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/videos/#gc">"Get Creative,"</a> <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/videos/#wwt">"Wanna Work Together?"</a> and <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/videos/#rr">"Reticulum Rex"</a>) worked with musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Lesser">J Lesser</a> to create a <a href="http://ozmo.com/WhatsOzmoVideo">short video that explains how Ozmo works</a>.
