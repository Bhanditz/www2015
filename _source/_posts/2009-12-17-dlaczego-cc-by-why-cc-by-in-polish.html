<p>We are excited to highlight the first Polish translation of our CC Learn Productions. <a href="http://creativecommons.pl/">CC Poland</a> has translated and adapted a CC Learn Recommendations doc---<a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ccLearn_primer-Why_CC_BY.pdf">Why CC BY?</a> into Polish: <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/8/85/Dlaczego_CCBY.pdf">Dlaczego CC BY?</a> The reason CC Poland could lead the way in translation and adaptation (and can do the same with all of our productions)? Because they're licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, which means anyone is free to translate, remix, republish, recolor, make a billion copies of... our work. Check out the Polish translation on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Translate/Documentation#CC_Learn_Productions">CC wiki</a>, where we have set up <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Translate/Documentation#CC_Learn_Productions">a page for translations</a> from around the world. Source files are available in Open Office (odt) as well as PDF, which you can also download from our newly revamped Productions page on the learn site at <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/productions">learn.creativecommons.org/productions</a>. </p>
<p>We encourage you or anyone you know to translate and adapt our productions to your local and lingual context, and upload your translation to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Translate/Documentation#CC_Learn_Productions">wiki</a>. Open educational resources work because there is a global community around them, and the CC Learn team fervently wishes we were fluent in more than a couple languages. However, we know we have an amazing community of people around the world who believe in the same things we do---so please help promote the movement in your region. Some suggested documents for translation are <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cclearn-explanations-oer-and-cc-licenses-05-apr-09.pdf">Open Educational Resources and Creative Commons Licensing</a>, <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ccLearn_primer-Why_CC_BY.pdf">Why CC BY?</a>, and <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cclearn-explanations-cc-license-compatability.pdf">Remixing OER: A Guide to License Compatibility</a>. These are just a few key documents to get people's feet wet to the idea of OER.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Get_Involved">create</a> your own community on <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/">OpenED</a> for your local project or region, where <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Es">ES</a> and <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Brazilian_Project_on_OER">Brazilian</a> communities have currently dropped anchors. It's a wiki as well--so anyone can create an account and start editing. </p>
