<p><a href="http://technorati.com/">Technorati</a>, the popular search service for identifying popular dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_generated_content">user-generated content</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/2007/01/275.html">today launched a slyly titled service</a>, WTF, or <a href="http://technorati.com/wtf/">Where's the Fire</a>, which allows for Technorati users to comment upon searches across their system (and the web). Technorati has decided to use the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 2.5 license</a> for all user generated content (UGC) for this WTF service, the same license they use on their website.</p>
<p>This feature adds a qualitative layer of user commenting to the quantitative service of identifying <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/">top popular searches</a> across the web from user generated content &mdash; most notably, blogs. Liz Dunn from Technorati <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/">sums up the reasoning</a> by stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Our users have told us that they want to know, immediately, WHY it is something is popular -- to explain what's happening out there on the Live Web, right now. They don't want to page through a hundred blog posts to figure out what Violent Acres is and why it's a top search; "Just take me straight to the good stuff, fast!"</p></blockquote>
<p>So, in the grand tradition of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3604">Technorati using a Creative Commons BY-NC license</a> (yes, I'm linking to a blog post from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/alumni#14">Matt Haughey</a> in 2003), they have yet again supported the commons by offering WTF's user generated content under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">CC BY-NC 2.5 license</a>. <a href="http://technorati.com/wtf/">Check out their service</a> and find out Where's the Fire.</p>
