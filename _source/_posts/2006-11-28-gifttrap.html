<p>GiftTrap is a fun new board game based on predicting what gifts other players might like. It uses more than 600 cards that feature user-submitted photos of gifts â€“ many of these images are Creative Commons-licensed and shot by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> photographers. The company behind GiftTrap has recently announced the <a href="http://www.gifttrap.com/creative_commons_contest">GiftTRAP Experience</a>, a contest where people can participate by suggesting gifts for future editions of the game, sumitting their own photos of gifts, and offering suggestions for new games that use GiftTrap's cards. You can print out a CC-licensed sample version of the game and learn more about the contest at <a href="http://www.gifttrap.com/">GiftTrap's Web site</a>.</p>
