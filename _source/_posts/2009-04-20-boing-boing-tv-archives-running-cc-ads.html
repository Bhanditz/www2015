<p><a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing tv</a>, purveyors of all things awesome, recently began running short adverts for CC as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bumper">bumpers</a> for almost all the videos produced up until February of this year. Check out their <a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/archives.html">video archives</a> to see the spots in the wild, one of which is cut from Jesse Dylan's <em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos/a-shared-culture">A Shared Culture</a></em>. </p>
<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7702">noted previously</a>, all Boing Boing tv episodes are released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC license</a>. A big thanks to the great people at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a> and Boing Boing tv for making this happen! </p>
