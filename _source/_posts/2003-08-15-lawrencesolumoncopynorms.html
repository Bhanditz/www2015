<p>Lawrence Solum runs the <a href="http://lsolum.blogspot.com/">Legal Theory Blog</a> and recently wrote <a href="http://lsolum.blogspot.com/2003_08_01_lsolum_archive.html#105974929858142384">a piece</a> on "Copynorms", the "informal social attitudes about the rightness or wrongness of duplicating material that is copyrighted." He describes a few scenarios that might come out of the recording industry's pending lawsuits against filetraders, and what effect (if any) that will have on Copynorms.</p>
