<p>Here at CC, we're big fans of the <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender Foundation</a>, which supports the open-source Blender 3D animation suite and produces beautiful animated films. The films are built entirely with open technologies and are licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a>. <a href="http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/"><em>Big Buck Bunny</em></a>, one of the early Blender films, raised a lot of awareness about Creative Commons licenses among animators and helped fuel the <a href="/weblog/entry/36917">Creative Commons film movement</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Blender is crowdfunding its most ambitious project yet, <a href="http://gooseberry.blender.org/wp-content/themes/gooseberry/">a full-length animated film codenamed Project Gooseberry</a>. The enigmatic trailer definitely sparked my curiosity:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blender.org/press/project-gooseberry-why-it-matters/">In this blog post</a>, Blender Foundation chair Ton Roosendaal lays out his ambitious goal for Gooseberry and projects like it:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's a real growing unrest out there about how a few greedy people control this business -  making their billions - while others lose jobs in the same week their company has won an Oscar. Yep, Mark Z. buys another toy for billions, which he makes by selling our digital lives. And we nerds just line up for yet another Marvel super hero movie again. Meanwhile the powers that be prepare for a separated internet â€“ with fast and "free" commercial channels â€“ and a slow, expensive one for the remains of the open internet we love.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I'm not fit for politics, nor do I feel much like protesting or mud slinging. I'm a maker â€“ I'm interested in finding solutions together and doing experiments with taking back control over our digital lives, our media, and especially get back ownership as creative people again â€“ and make a decent living with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The crowdfunding campaign ends this week. <a href="http://gooseberry.blender.org/wp-content/themes/gooseberry/">Check it out!</a></p>
