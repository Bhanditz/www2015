<p>I tried limiting this list to ten, but I couldn't do it. There's no way I could really limit it to twenty, even, but I'll go with the first score that come to mind, in no particular order.</p>
<p>(1) Meeting the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4244">World's Coolest Man</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/gil-cc.jpg" style="border:1px solid #666;margin-left:14px;" alt="Gil and Team" /></p>
<p>(2) Singing karaoke in Seoul with the lawyers of <a href="http://www.kafil.or.kr/">KAFIL</a>, CC's affiliate institution for the newly launched <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/kr/">Creative Commons Korea</a>.</p>
<p>(3) Getting a phone call in January 2002 from my former professor and long-time hero Lawrence Lessig -- who, I couldn't be sure, really remembered me -- inviting me to join Creative Commons.</p>
<p>(4) Seeing Gilberto Gil and David Byrne <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4415">perform</a> Cole Porter's "Don't Fence Me In" at the WIRED Creative Commons benefit concert.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/gil-byrne_fence.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="gil-byrne" /></p>
<p>(5) Brainstorming on and making <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learnmore">"Get Creative" and "Reticulum Rex"</a> with Neeru Paharia, Ryan Junell, Benjamen Walker, and Christopher Lydon.</p>
<p>(6) Seeing the Brazilian Portuguese translation of both movies at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4236">the launch of CC Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>(7) First trying out the phrase "Some Rights Reserved" at a meeting with the great folks -- and later, friends -- of <a href="http://cnx.rice.edu">Rice Connexions</a>.</p>
<p>(8) Talking about rock-and-roll, over beers, with Jamie Boyle, Mike Carroll, and Eric Saltzman after my first CC board meeting in Cambrige, MA.</p>
<p>(9) Sharing countless lunches (and jokes) with CC staff at the Treehouse, on Stanford's campus.</p>
<p>(10) Receiving the amazing going-away gifts of an iPod Shuffle full of CC music and a beautiful CC Taiwan poster from Lessig and the CC team on my last day.</p>
<p>(11) Seeing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4070">Grandmaster Flash perform, in a very weird context</a>, at SXSW.</p>
<p>(12) Watching Justin Cone's "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/learnmore">Building on the Past</a>" for the first time.</p>
<p>(13) Seeing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#18">Christiane</a>'s daughter Lara playing with <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/thebean-thumb.jpg">Willem</a> at Larry and Bettina's house.</p>
<p>(14) At Duke's <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/framed/">FRAMED! conference</a>, seeing Negativland's Mark Hosler meet, confront, and then make friends with the lawyer who set the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.01/negativland.html">U2 brouhaha in motion</a>.</p>
<p>(15) The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5355">CC Europe Summit</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://nl.creativecommons.org/blimg/050317cc_eu_meet_sm.jpg"><img src="img/050317cc_eu_meet_sm.jpg" height="166" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>(16) Awaking from a nap under my desk to hear everyone from CC and <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/">Stanford CIS</a> singing Happy Birthday on my 30th.</p>
<p>(17) Hearing a crazed David Byrne fan tell my mother, age 73 -- at her first rock show ever -- that the song "Psycho Killer" reminded him of her.</p>
<p>(18) Eating at Carl's Jr. at 3am with two members of the <a href="http://www.thepolyphonicspree.com/main.html">Polyphonic Spree</a>.</p>
<p>(19) Experiencing the mayhem before, and the joy during, every Creative Commons party.</p>
<p>(20) Doing an interview, with Lessig and Neeru, with the cartoon blogger <a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/machina/r/ccinterview.html">Machina</a> in Tokyo.<br />
<img alt="blog_image_2" src="img/blog_image_2" /></p>
<p>And there are so many more.</p>
<p>What kills me about putting this list together is to think of all the great things that I will miss out on from today forward.</p></p>
