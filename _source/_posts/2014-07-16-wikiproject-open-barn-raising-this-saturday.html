<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OPEN">WikiProject Open</a> is an online School of Open training program for new and seasoned Wikipedia volunteers to collaborate on improving Wikipedia articles related to openness. The aim of the project is two-fold: in addition to improving Wikipedia articles related to openness (such as open access publishing and open educational resources), volunteers seek to improve Wikimedia content generally with the aid of openly licensed materials. </p>

<p>This Saturday, WikiProject Open's Pete Forsyth and Sara Frank Bristow invite you to join their Barn Raising event from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. U.S. Pacific Time, at the Oakland Impact Hub on 2323 Broadway, Oakland, California. Lunch and refreshments will be provided. You can also join the event online. Sara <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/youre-invited-wikipedia-barn-raising-event-on-saturday-july-19th/">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"At the Barn Raising, we will focus on high priority Wikipedia articles: articles that are widely read, but that â€” despite ongoing efforts â€” remain poorly sourced, incomplete, or out of date. (In the wiki world, we often borrow the term â€œBarn Raisingâ€ to evoke the idea of a community coming together to build something substantial in a short time. Itâ€™s been described as a way to â€œmake the impossible possible.â€)<br />
<br />
This event is open to all! Our goal is to make significant improvements to OER related articles; so those who are brand new to Wikipedia and/or open education might want to take a little time to prepare. We will send out helpful resources for beginners as the date gets closer."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>The School of Open is a global community of volunteers focused on providing free education opportunities on the meaning, application, and impact of "openness" in the digital age and its benefit to creative endeavors, education, and research. Volunteers develop and run online courses, offline workshops, and real world training programs on topics such as Creative Commons licenses, open educational resources, and sharing creative works. The School of Open is coordinated by Creative Commons and P2PU, a peer learning community for developing and running free online courses.</em></p>
