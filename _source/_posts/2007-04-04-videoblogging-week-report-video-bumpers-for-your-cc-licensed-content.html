<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7304">mentioned before</a>, Jay Dedman invited myself and <a href="http://www.vogelelaw.com/">Colette Vogel</a> to speak about <a href="/licenses">Creative Commons Licensing</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Podcasting_Legal_Guide">Podcasting Legal Guide</a> as the <a href="http://superhappyvloghouse.pbwiki.com/SanFrancisco">kick-off event</a> to this week, the <a href="http://videobloggingweek.pbwiki.com/">annual international Videoblogging Week</a>. Both Colette and I led a discussion with many popular videobloggers outside in a nice sunny park in mission bay in SF. We then went indoors where I discussed how Videobloggers can <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking">mark their video files with video bumpers</a> (in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/policies">accordance with our trademark policies of course</a>), to signal to others how they may use original content.</p>
<p>Please check out the <a href="http://superhappyvloghouse.pbwiki.com/Creative%20Commons%20Trailers">video bumpers that people created last saturday</a> and remember that marking your videos (and other content) visually before uploading to sites like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube">Youtube</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a> is important for signaling how you want your work used in accordance with a CC license of your choice. Don't forget to "Leave Your Mark."</p>
