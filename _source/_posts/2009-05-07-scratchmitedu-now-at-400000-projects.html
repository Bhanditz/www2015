<p>A couple years ago, the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT Media Lab developed a Web 2.0 programming platform for kids called <em><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a></em>. <em>Scratch</em> allows kids, and virtually anyone else, to create and remix rich media of all kinds---video, video games, even simple photo animations. The programming behind <em>Scratch</em> focuses on building blocks, like Legos, to get kids not only friendly, but adept at the technology that dominates our world. Each user can create a project, whether it be a video or a video game, and upload it to share on the <em>Scratch</em> website. <em>Scratch</em> currently exceeds more than 400,000 projects, all licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, allowing any youth to flex her creative muscles and enhance a peer's project by remixing it with her own.</p>
<p> The School Library Journal wrote up an excellent <a href="http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6654567.html?industryid=47087">article</a> about them last week, emphasizing that "Literacy in the 21st century encompasses the full range of skills needed to engage in our global societyâ€”computer, information technology, media, and information literacy skills." The SLJ reports that <em>Scratch</em> is now being tested in libraries in the Minneapolis area, "to determine if the workshops and classes for young people are replicable and sustainable for a range of libraries." Unsurprisingly, library staff are finding that kids quickly learn the program on their own, and are guided more by their own intuitions than an "expert's" instruction. </p>
<p>I decided to try out <em>Scratch</em> myself, and found some cool projects along the way. One project by "cougars" is <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/cougers/511761">a photo animation</a> of a human skateboard. Another is a video game <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/PetertheGeek/233070">simulation</a> of the Buggers war from <em>Ender's Game</em> by PetertheGeek. (<strong>How</strong> cool is that?)</p>
<p>What's more, the <em>Scratch</em> program is global, available in more than <a href="http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Languages">40 languages</a>, and the code itself is free for anyone to copy, publish, or distribute. </p>
