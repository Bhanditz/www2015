<p><a href="http://kruufm.com/">KRUU in Fairfield, Iowa</a> is a community radio station run on open source software. <a href="http://poynder.blogspot.com/2007/01/open-radio.html">Richard Poynder recently profiled the station</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Moore's use of the term "open radio" caught my attention. What, I wondered, did he mean?</p>
<p>Amongst other things, it seems, he meant that KRUU has made a commitment to use only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a> software. As KRUU founder Roland Wells explained on Open Views, all KRUU's PCs run on the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU/Linux</a> operating system, and the audio editing tools (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardour_%28audio_processor%29">Ardour</a> and <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>) used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey">DJs</a> at the station are also Open Source. Likewise, the office suite used by Moore to administer the station (<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>) is Open Source, and the station's web site was built using <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">Free BSD UNIX</a>, and is hosted on the Open Source web server <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_web_server">Apache</a>.</p>
<p>By using Open Source solutions rather than proprietary software, Wells told KRUU listeners, the station has saved "tens of thousands of dollars".</p></blockquote>
<p>KRUU's software philosophy seems to come from <a href="http://kruufm.com/node/4">Open Views</a> producer <a href="http://kruufm.com/user/4">Sundar Raman</a> and founder Roland Wells, as explained in the <a href="http://kruufm.com/node/161">first broadcast of Open Views</a> (which also features a short interview with me on Creative Commons; the program's <a href="http://kruufm.com/node/205">third broadcast features an hour on Creative Commons</a>).</p>
<p>Sundar Raman has since interviewed a number of people involved in Open Source, Open Culture, and Open Science, including most recently John Wilbanks of <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> (not yet archived). You can also see Raman's influence showing up in music programming, e.g., <a href="http://kruufm.com/node/259">Dance Show Friday Night</a> playing CC-licensed music from <a href="http://jamendo.com">Jamendo</a>.</p>

<p>Station manager <a href="http://kruufm.com/user/87">James Moore</a> adds:<br />
<blockquote>Just thought you might like to know that since we began broadcasting last September, KRUU has offered a one-hour program seven days a week called The Open Source Radio Hour (5am-6am) featuring Creative Commons licensed material, primarily from jamendo.com or magnatune.com. so far.</p></blockquote>
