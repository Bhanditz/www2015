<blockquote><p>"We want to start the year with a workshop with Creative Commons and the initiative "School of Open"! The initiative of Creative Commons and the Peer-2-Peer University (P2PU) aims to develop online courses that help you create free content and tools to use and develop. There are English courses on Wikipedia and the use of free content, but as of yet nothing in German. Also, the subject of "free educational content" is not yet represented in courses. So there is still much to do. As part of Open Education Week further work is required.<br />
<br />
Together, we want to work intensively on the expansion of the existing courses. It will focus on tools and topics related to free access to knowledge. Anyone can create courses and remix existing courses on their own -- but it's best to share. After some brief input from Creative Commons, we will start working. So bring your ideas, and let's share our knowledge!"</p></blockquote>
<p>To participate, please RSVP to legal@creativecommons.de by February 27th!</p>
