<p>The online magazine <em><a href="http://slate.msn.com/">Slate</a></em> has <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2117760/">a great review article</a> on the Star Wars fan-created movie <a href="http://www.panicstruckpro.com/revelations/revelations_movie.html">Revelations</a>. Slate's Clive Thompson gives the film high marks saying the story and special effects are better than the recent Star Wars prequels and even goes so far as to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>George Lucas has always encouraged Star WarsÂ­-inspired fan movies, so long as the wannabe auteurs didn't try to make a profit. (That's the case with Feluxâ€”he isn't selling his movie or any associated merchandise.) Lucas should do more, though. Once he stops polluting the world with prequels, he should slap a liberal "Creative Commons" copyright license on the Star Wars franchise. That would explicitly allow any fan to remix an existing movie, or create a new one in homage, so long as there's no profit involved. Everyone wins: Movies like Revelations keep the fan base alive, and Lucas can continue selling figurines until the sun explodes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like an idea we at Creative Commons could get behind. An <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">attribution-noncommercial-sharealike</a> license would allow fan created side stories, prequels, or follow-ups, and they'd never be sold or charged for and a credit would always be given to Lucas. It'll be interesting to see if any aging properties with a large cult-like fan following adopt something like this. One could speculate that fan art would drive sales of the original, when outsiders take a liking to these offshoots, and in the end mean more sales of DVDs and toys for creators like Lucas.</p>
