<p><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/">OpenStax College</a>, an initiative of <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a>, the open educational resources (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/education#OER">OER</a>) authoring project at Rice University, is creating high-quality, peer-reviewed open textbooks. All of OpenStax College's books, including the art and illustrations, are available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> (CC BY), allowing anyone to reuse, revise, remix and redistribute the books.</p>
<p>The first two OpenStax College books were published in June of 2012, and since then <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/introduction-to-sociology"><em>Introduction to Sociology</em></a> and <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-physics"><em>College Physics</em></a> have been downloaded over 110,000 times, used by more than 1.5 million unique online learners, and adopted at over 200 schools. These adoptions represent real savings for over 30,000 students in classes around the world. OpenStax College estimates that it has saved these students more than $3 million (USD) so far.</p>
<p>OpenStax isn't stopping there. <em>Biology</em> and its corresponding book for non-majors, <em>Concepts of Biology</em>, and <em>Anatomy & Physiology</em> have now been released and are ready for use in classes in the fourth quarter of 2013. </p>
<p>OpenStax College recently received grants to complete six more books from several major foundations, including the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Kanzanjian Foundation and Lowenstein Foundation. The next phase will feature <em>Introduction to Statistics</em>, <em>Pre-Calculus</em>, <em>Principles of Economics</em>, <em>U.S. History</em>, <em>Psychology</em>, and <em>Chemistry</em>. These books are entering production now and are scheduled to be released by the end of 2014.</p>
