<p><strong>San Francisco, CA, USA â€” December 5, 2006</strong><br />
Creative Commons and <em>New World Notes</em> are pleased to sponsor a conversation with Judge Richard A. Posner in the virtual world of Second Life on December 7, 2006 at 6-8pm PST. Second Life is an online society in a 3D world, where users can explore, build, socialize, and participate in their own economy. Visit <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Kula%204/46/92/26/">this SLurl</a> to launch the Second Life application and link to Creative Commonsâ€™ virtual headquarters, where the event will take place.</p>
<p>Judge Richard A. Posner is a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School and a judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. He will log into Second Life as an avatar crafted in his likeness to discuss his new book, <em>Not a Suicide Pact: The Constitution in a Time of National Emergency</em>. In his book, Judge Posner discusses the role of constitutional law and government conduct as it relates to enforcing national security and adjusting civil liberties in a time of heightened terrorist watch.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion between discussion moderator James Au (AKA â€œHamlet Auâ€ in Second Life) and Judge Posner, the audience will have a chance to ask questions. Judge Posner will also sign virtual copies of his book.</p>
<p>To attend the event, register for a free Second Life account and download the software at <a href="http://secondlife.com/">SecondLife.com</a>. Please RSVP to Jennifer Yip (AKA â€œGenevieve Junotâ€ in Second Life) via SL IM or email her directly at jennifer@creativecommons.org with your Second Life first and last name. Space is limited to the first 100 people who respond. For those who cannot attend, the conversationâ€™s transcript will be made available on James Auâ€™s blog, New World Notes.</p>
