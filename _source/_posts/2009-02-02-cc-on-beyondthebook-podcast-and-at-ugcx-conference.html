<p>The latest <a href="http://beyondthebookcast.com/sharing-and-selling-user-generated-content/">Beyond The Book podcast</a> (<a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.beyondthebookcast.com/wp-podcasts/CreativeCommonsPodcast.mp3">mp3</a>) features an interview with CC staff Mike Linksvayer and Melissa Reeder. The two main themes discussed are the intersection of public sharing under CC licenses and alternative private arrangements (see our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10832">post on Ozmo</a>, a service that enables both, discussed on the podcast) and the upcoming UGCX conference.</p>
<p>Melissa Reeder will speak on a panel titled <a href="http://www.ugcxevent.com/phototrack.html#p5">Sharing, Selling and Defending Photos Online</a> at the conference, February 10 in San Jose, California.</p>
<p>Conference attendees intrigued by what Melissa has to say can make the trip up to San Francisco the next evening (February 11) for our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12554">CC Salon  SF</a>!</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> Those in San Jose looking for even more CC info, and soon, you're in luck. Thursday evening (February 5) Mike is presenting <a href="http://clasj02052009.eventbrite.com/">Open Licensing 101: How to Get the Most Out of Your Copyrights in the Information Age</a>, hosted by California Lawyers for the Arts.</p>
