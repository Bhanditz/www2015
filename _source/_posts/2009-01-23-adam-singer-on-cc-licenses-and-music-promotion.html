<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/adamgsinger">Adam Singer</a> is a musician and "<a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20090114/0645323402.shtml">social media guru</a>" who used his expertise in both fields to find a more harmonious means of online promotion. As a relatively "unknown artist", Singer saw little return on efforts to profit from his works as CDs and digital downloads, selling only a few copies with "mixed results". It was at this point that Singer chose to release his music under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC license</a>.</p>
<p>The choice was not motivated from a promotional standpoint - Singer turned to CC licensing after the "realization [he] would rather have [his] music reach more ears as the money [he] was making was worth far less than the joy of being able to share it with others" - but it spurred unintended promotional results. A recent post on <a href="http://thefuturebuzz.com/2009/01/14/creative-commons-license-ultimate-music-promotion-tool/">TheFutureBuzz</a> outlines the results of Singer's choice - soon, he found his music appearing on <a href="http://www.louisgray.com/live/2009/01/early-adoption-can-stem-to-music-as.html">music</a> <a href="http://www.filter27.com/archives/2008/09/linkage-september-15-2008.php">blogs</a>, had <a href="http://twitter.com/lonelypond/statuses/1111837558">people</a> on Twitter soliciting him for original music for video, had his music featured on online web radio shows, saw a fan remix video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9F3gglhblE">pop-up on YouTube</a>, and saw traffic to his MySpace page increase dramatically.</p>
<p>It is obvious to those who listen that Singer's music is of high-quality, but by encouraging the free sharing and reuse of this music he was able to reach a far greater audience than he had previously. The story, heard many times before in a variety of incarnations, brings about echoes of <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/lpt/a/3015">Tim O'Reilly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obscurity is a far greater threat to authors and creative artists than piracy.</p></blockquote>
