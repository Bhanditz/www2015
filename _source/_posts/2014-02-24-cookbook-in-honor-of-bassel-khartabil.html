<p>In honor of Bassel Khartabil and <a href="/weblog/entry/41863">Free Bassel Day</a>, artist <a href="http://lettersforbassel.tumblr.com/">Niki Korth</a> is putting together a <a href="http://freebassel.org/">#freebassel</a> cookbook. Bassel, a free software activist and leader of the Syrian Creative Commons community, <a href="http://freebassel.org/campaign/">has been in prison since 2012</a>. In Niki's words:</p>
<blockquote><p>The #FreeBassel Cookbook is a collection of recipes from people who care about Bassel and would like to share a meal with him if he weren't in prison.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J4bRAL2zyR4UP_AE-7nNmX0Bk3Qaf6LuAzb6kVu7AOs/viewform"><strong>Please contribute a recipe to this collection.</strong></a> Submit it before 10 March 2014 to get it included in the first edition of the cookbook. Pick a recipe that is special to you, a recipe that makes you think of Bassel, a recipe that reminds you that the virtual/digital world is only a tool for real world human encounters, and is in no way a substitute for experiences such as sharing a meal, or a recipe for a meal that you think Bassel would enjoy.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The #FreeBassel Cookbook V.1 will be released as a free, digital book on #FreeBassel Day 2014 (15 March)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If Bassel has not been freed by this date, please make a recipe from this collection on this day in his honor and share it with people who you care about. Share pictures of your meal with the #FreeBassel hashtag.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Repeat until Bassel is free.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1J4bRAL2zyR4UP_AE-7nNmX0Bk3Qaf6LuAzb6kVu7AOs/viewform">Submit your recipe here</a>. <a href="/weblog/entry/41863">See our previous post</a> to learn how to get involved with Free Bassel Day.</p>
