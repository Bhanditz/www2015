<p>Two new interesting works with political themes have been released under Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gritty.org">Gritty, A Critique of the Global Good Life</a>, by Michael Wadleigh and Cleo Huggins, is an overview of global economics and politics presented in an easily digestible format.  The work offers a thoughtful commentary on politics, the media, and other social issues.  <em>Gritty</em> complements its critiques with a wide variety of statistics and graphics that tell a story beyond words.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raymondpirouz.com">Your Guide to Modern Living</a>, by Raymond Pirouz, makes the case for a new type of economic system based on abundance rather than scarcity.  It asserts that economic progress -- more specifically automation -- might free people to find richness in life through family, creativity, and spirituality.  </p>
<p>Both works are licensed under Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0">attribution, noncommercial, no derivative works licenses</a>, so pass them around to friends, put them on your site, and print them out -- that's what this is all about.  </p>
