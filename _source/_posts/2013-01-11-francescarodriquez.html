<p>So it's taken me much, much longer than I had planned to say thanks to everyone I worked with at Creative Commons. (Indeed, I'm going on two months.) I have no great excuses, except to say that it can be hard sometimes to say exactly what you feel about people you like a lot. But onward, onward.</p>
