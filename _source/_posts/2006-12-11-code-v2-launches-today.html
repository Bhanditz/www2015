<p>Lawrence Lessig's book <em><a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003633.shtml">Code v2</a></em> officially launched today. <em>Code v2</em> is the revision of his 1999 <em><a href="http://www.code-is-law.org/">Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</a></em>. Code v2 is not so much a new book as it is a translation of a very old (in Internet time) one.</p>
<p><em> Code v2 </em>was written collaboratively with the world. Part of the update was written through a wiki, which is still accessible <a href="http://codebook.jot.com/WikiHome">here</a>. That text was then edited and added to Lessig's overall revision. The wiki text was licensed under a CC Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 License as is the derivative <em>Code v2</em>. In order to recognize and honor the contributions of the community to <em>Code v2,</em> all royalties have been dedicated to Creative Commons.</p>
<p><em>Code v2</em> is offered for free as a PDF download <a title="here" href="http://codev2.cc/">here</a> but if you are adding it to your holiday reading list please consider buying the book <a title="here" href="http://codev2.cc/buy+codev2/">here</a> (as it is cheaper than printing it on you own) and supporting the CC's annual campaign as it is rapidly approaching its end.</p>
