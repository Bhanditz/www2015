<p><a href="http://www.own-it.org/">Own It</a> is a new service which offers free intellectual property advice for Londonâ€™s creative people.  They've published an excellent six page <a href="http://www.own-it.org/assets/library/documents/creative_commons_factsheet.pdf">Creative Commons factsheet</a>, which is itself licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license and provides a working demonstration of giving reused work attribution (see footnote, page 2).</p>
<p>They're also offering a free seminar for film, video and TV professionals on January 25: <a href="http://www.own-it.org/events/details/?eventId=35">Creative Commons, copyright, contracts.. and you!</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Hosted by Channel 4â€™s IDEASFACTORY, this free Own It talk for film, video and TV professionals covers copyright and design law for film, video and TV businesses, including a special overview of the new Creative Commons licences and how they can be applied to the film, TV and new media industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>As of this writing, 73 of 84 seats are already taken. Better <a href="http://www.own-it.org/events/details/?eventId=35">hurry</a> if you're in London.</p>
