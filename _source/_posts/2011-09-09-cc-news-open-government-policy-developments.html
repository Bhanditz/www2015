<p>While we gear up for the CC Global Summit that is just a week away, governments around the world continue to open up their data and adopt policies for maximum transparency and citizen engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Open government developments in Austria, New Zealand, and Australia</strong></p>
<p>In Austria, the City of Vienna, along with the Chancellor&rsquo;s Office and the Austrian cities of Linz, Salzburg and Graz, coordinated their activities to establish the Cooperation OGD (Open Government Data) Austria. In its first session, the group agreed to eight key points, the first of which was, &quot;All public administration will be free under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 3.0), meaning it can be reused and shared for any purpose, with only attribution necessary.&rdquo; Read <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28744?utm_campaign=newsletter_1109&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">more</a>.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the Ministers of Finance and Internal Affairs adopted a statement detailing a new Declaration on Open and Transparent Government that directs, encourages, and invites various departments, state services agencies, and state sector agencies to commit to releasing high value public data actively for re-use, in accordance with the Declaration and Principles, and in accordance with the NZGOAL Review and Release process.
