<p><em><a href="http://www.notldr.com/next/about.html">Night Of The Living Dead: Reanimated</a></em> is a collaborative project that takes George Romero's cult horror classic, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_living_dead">Night of the Living Dead</a></em> and very literally reanimates the entire film. Featuring work from a <a href="http://www.notldr.com/next/artists.html">huge number</a> of artists, the project as a whole is being released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND license</a> with individual artists retaining rights to their contributions. It is well documented that the original film is in the public domain and in that spirit, Mike Schneider - the projects curator - is releasing all of his notes and documentation under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY license</a> so others have a leg-up in making their own iterations of the project.</p>
<p>The project is currently looking for independent venues to screen the film come this fall and is slating a DVD release for the upcoming winter - be sure to <a href="http://www.notldr.com/next/contact.html">contact the project leads</a> for more information. Similarly, they are currently soliciting collaborators for their next project, <em><a href="http://ipetitions.com/petition/unseenhorror">Unseen Horror</a></em>.</p>
