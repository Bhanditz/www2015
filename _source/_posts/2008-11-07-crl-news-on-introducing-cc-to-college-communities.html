<p>The current issue of <em>College &amp; Research Libraries News</em> includes a great article entitled <a href="http://www.acrl.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/crlnews/2008/nov/beautyofsrr.cfm">"The beauty of "Some Rights Reserved": Introducing Creative Commons to librarians, faculty, and students."</a> It's a clear and insightful round-up of the challenges that college campuses face when it comes to copyright, followed by an examination of the benefits of Creative Commons licensing in academic settings. The article also offers practical steps for people looking to teach  faculty, researchers, students, staff, and librarians about CC's tools and projects. The written piece is complemented by a <a href="http://www.acrl.ala.org/acrlinsider/2008/11/06/acrl-podcast-the-beauty-of-some-rights-reserved/">podcast</a> interview with the article's author, University of Michigan copyright specialist <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/">Molly Kleinman</a>, who has recently posted a series of very useful "<a href="http://mollykleinman.com/category/howto/">CC HowTo</a>" tips on her own site.</p>
