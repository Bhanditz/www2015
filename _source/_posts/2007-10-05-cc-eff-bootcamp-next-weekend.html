<p>I'm giving a presentation about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about">Creative Commons</a> at <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation's</a> (EFF) <a href="http://www.eff.org/bootcamp/">Bootcamp</a> (for Web 2.0 workers on user-generated content) next Wednesday, October 10, 2007. Here is a <a href="http://www.eff.org/bootcamp/">summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
EFF is hosting a one-day session for Web 2.0 workers who handle issues arising from users and user-generated content. From DMCA to CDA to ECPA, the law surrounding internet content can be confusing, especially for the folks who have to decide on the fly whether to let something stay up or take it down, or whether to give their customer's name to the FBI agent on the phone. Let us help.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://rejon.org/">I</a>'m speaking at 12:15 right before lunch. Come out to this event if you want to learn more about:</p>
<ul>
<li> Defamation, harassment, and other accusations of bad behavior.</li>
<li> Fair use, free culture, and the right to remix.</li>
<li> Copyright take-downs and put-backs: Understanding the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</li>
<li> How to respond to cops, crooks, and courts who want your customers' communications and other private information.</li>
<li> How to avoid becoming the next Napster and stay on the safe side of the Copyright Wars.</li>
<li> The rights of anonymous speakers.</li>
<li> Porn, predators, and the pressure to police.</li>
<li> Lightning rounds on Creative Commons licenses, webcasting and what to do when you've been hacked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, please come out and ask me about anything under the sun including upcoming releases of <a href="/projects/livecontent">LiveContent 2.0</a>, where we are at with working on <a href="http://laptop.org">OLPC</a>, and generally anything else CC-related.</p>
