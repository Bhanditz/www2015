<p>Following the exciting news of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29133">Europeana's new data exchange agreement</a>, which authorizes Europeana to release the metadata for millions of cultural works into the public domain using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 public domain dedication</a>, the Conference of European National Librarians (<a href="http://www.cenl.org/">CENL</a>) voted to support the agreement in a meeting last week at the Royal Library of Denmark. CENL represents Europeâ€™s national libraries and "is responsible for the massive collection of publications that represent the accumulated knowledge of Europe." From the <a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/portal/organisation/press/documents/CENL%20adopts%20CC0.pdf">press release</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>"It means that the datasets describing all the millions of books and texts ever published in Europe â€“ the title, author, date, imprint, place of publication and so on, which exists in the vast library catalogues of Europe â€“ will become increasingly accessible for anybody to re-use for whatever purpose they want.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bruno Racine, new Chair of CENL and President of the BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France, and Dr. Elisabeth Niggemann, former Chair of CENL and Director of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, welcomed the leadership shown by CENL. Dr Niggemann said...â€˜Only in that way can society derive full social and economic benefit from the data that weâ€™ve created to record Europeâ€™s published output over the past 500 years. The best analogy is between bottled water and a water main. Rather than bottling it and branding it, weâ€™re putting data on tap, so that everyone has free and open access, and can use it for whatever purpose they need.â€™"</p></blockquote>
