This week's featured content is <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/">MobileWhack</a>. It's a new site dedicated to tweaks, hacks, and hints on how to extend the phone, PDA, music player, and/or any other gadget you might carry around in a pocket. The content is released under a Creative Commons license and if you're a gadget freak, I can assure you there is at least one new piece of software or tip you can use if you check MobileWhack out.</p>
