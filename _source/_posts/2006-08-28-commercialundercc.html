<p>CC licensing commercials, at least under a restrictive <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs</a> license, seems like a no-brainer (adverisers should want their message spread as much as possible) and allowing derivatives not much of a stretch (going "viral" and all that), but not many have taken these steps.</p>
<p>Now multimedia pioneer Marc Canter has published a <a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/08/intro-to-peopleaggregator-tv-commercial">commercial for his PeopleAggregator startup</a> under our liberal <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Attribution</a> license. I don't suppose Marc would mind if you made him "go viral."</p>
<p><a href="http://blip.tv/file/66306">Watch</a> the commercial. Also note that <a href="http://peopleaggregator.net">PeopleAggregator</a>, an "open social network", enables CC licensing of user created images and videos.</p>
