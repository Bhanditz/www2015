<p>Congratulations to former Creative Commons General Counsel <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/alumni#36">Mia Garlick</a>, who has <a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/20634/127/">joined the Australian government to lead its digital economy initiatives</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>iTWire has learnt that Mia Garlick, an Australian lawyer who was most recently product counsel for YouTube, has been appointed to head the Australian Government's drive for the digital economy future, as assistant secretary in the Department of Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy (BCDE)</p>
<p>Her appointment is linked to communications minister Stephen Conroy's announcement this week of plans to prepare Australia for the future 'digital economy'. In preparation for this initiative the department advertised in May for "a talented and highly motivated senior manager to lead the Digital Economy Branch within the Department...[to provide] leadership and strategic direction to a branch with responsibility for the development of the digital economy in Australia."</p></blockquote>
<p>While at CC, Mia <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249">led development of the CC version 3.0 licenses</a> and nearly every other project we undertook during her tenure, in addition to undertaking regular speaking engagements <span title="and in second life">worldwide. Her intelligence, energy, and wit are certainly just what the Australian digital economy needs.  Good luck!</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au">Creative Commons Australia</a> has long been a leading CC jurisdiction project, especially in the field of public sector information. Just in the last week the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/188">National Innovation Review recommended CC</a> and a minister <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/189">immediately endorsed the recommendation</a>.</p>
