<p><a href="http://wikipages.com/">Wikipages.com</a>, a "wiki-fied" business directory that allows anyone to add and edit entries on business listings, has recentlly gone CC by licensing all their content under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA licence</a>. Although currently focused on the NYC-Metro area, Wikipages is gearing up to take on more cities in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This is another fine example of the power of CC-licences at work. Offering an alternative to traditional yellow pages, Wikipages uses the open structure of a wiki to create a citizen-mobilized, and potentially more comprehensive, listing of businesses in metropolitan areas. By choosing CC-licensing, Wikipages furthers this goal by ensuring this information stays open not only in terms of contribution but distribution as well, a practice that can only lead to numerous benefits for both businesses and the public alike.</p>
