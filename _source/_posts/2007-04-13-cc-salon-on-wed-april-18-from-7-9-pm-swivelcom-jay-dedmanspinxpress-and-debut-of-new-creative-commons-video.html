<p>As if you didn't have enough to do next week in San Francisco for the big Web 2.0 conference, Creative Commons is putting on another Creative Commons Salon at <a href="http://shinesf.com">Shinesf.com</a> from 7-9 PM (1337 Mission St in San Francisco) on Wednesday, April 18. It is a great place to meet-up with others interested in Creative Commons flexible licensing, technology and standards and informally discuss how to work together.</p>
<p>Confirmed to present for the next salon is <a href="http://swivel.com">Swivel.com</a>, talking about their great project with the motto: "Upload and explore data." If you missed it, there is a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7307">great graph of license adoption by photo sharers on Flickr.com</a> on their site, so we will explore this live. Also presenting is videoblogger <a href="http://www.momentshowing.net/about.html">Jay Dedman</a> who will discuss his involvement with Dave Toole's companies, <a href="http://spinxpress.com/">SpinXpress</a> and <a href="http://outhink.com/">Outhink.com</a>. And finally, Eric Steuer, Creative Director for Creative Commons will show off a new video about CC Plus Commercial Rights in order to get feedback before it goes 100% live. NOTE: There will be approximately 2 more guest presentations to be announced in the coming days.</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in publishing, please show up at the salon at 6 PM for another <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPA">CC Publishers Association meeting</a>.</p>
<p>Please add yourself to the list of other people coming out to the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/174727/">event on our upcoming.org page</a>. See you there!</p>
