<p>Stanford Magazine carries <a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2004/julaug/farm/news/lessig.html">a story this month</a> about our chairman and co-founder <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>'s book which has just entered its third printing. This is interesting because the book is <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freecontent/">freely available online for download</a> (under a Creative Commons license), and has been downloaded about 180,000 times. On the one hand an author can give away free content for folks to <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/remixes/">remake into audio books, translations, and other formats</a>, <strong>and</strong> the author still gets paid through traditional book sales. Amazing how that works, and works so well sometimes. [via <a href="http://www.corante.com/copyfight/">Copyfight</a>]</p>
