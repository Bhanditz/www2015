<p>The Open Professionals Education Network (<a href="http://open4us.org">OPEN</a>) - led by Creative Commons - is holding a conference tomorrow for grantees of the $500 million U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grant Program (<a href="http://www.doleta.gov/taaccct/">TAACCCT</a>) program. Grantees will learn how to openly license (under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>) all educational materials created under the program so that they may be freely accessed, shared and reused by anyone. CC BY is a requirement of the funding. Grantees will also be shown how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use tools and techniques for improving access to their materials and <a href="http://www.cast.org/udl/">universal design</a>;</li>
<li>maximise interoperability, and</li>
<li>conform to best practice e-learning open standards and specifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grantees will meet other grantees with similar projects for potential collaboration. Collaborating may increase the quality and speed of course development, and free up more time to adapt courses to local needs (for example to major employer needs). Collaboration is also important given many new courses are in emerging industries - such as robotics, mechatronics, health information technology, green construction, green energy and geospatial technologies - where existing materials are not as prevalent and where many projects aim to use innovative teaching tools such as virtual labs.</p>
<p>The conference is fully booked, which indicates strong interest in learning the best ways to enable open education practices.</p>
<p>OPEN includes Creative Commons, Carnegie Mellon <a href="http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/">Open Learning Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.cast.org/">CAST</a>, and the <a href="http://www.sbctc.edu/">Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges</a>. It has been funded by the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to provide free support to grantees to help them meet grant requirements. For more information on OPEN see <a href="http://open4us.org">http://open4us.org</a>.</p>
<p>The TAACCCT program supports President Obamaâ€™s goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020 by helping to increase the number of workers who attain degrees, certificates, and other industry-recognized credentials. Openly licensing the materials created under this program may create a multiplier benefit to course content and development nationwide. Benefits may include: accelerated course development and learning, improved pedagogies and retention, and broader access for citizens regardless of their location and wealth. Open licensing optimizes the impact of taxpayer funds spent on the TAACCCT grants.</p>
