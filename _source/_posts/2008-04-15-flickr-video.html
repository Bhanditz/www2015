<p>Wondering what those moving images popping up in your friends' Flickr photostream are? Last week <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/04/09/video-on-flickr-2/">Flickr introduced the ability for users to upload videos as well as photos</a>, adding new functionality to one of the web's leading media-sharing sites.</p>
<p>Flickr has <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7028">long</a> been exemplary of a well executed, <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons">CC-enabled</a> content community. By utilizing the same simple, clean, and straightforward interface to CC licensing that they have employed for photo uploads, Flickr Video poses itself to be a huge resource for those in the CC community who create and reuse video.</p>
<p>Anyone can see videos, but only users with <a href="http://flickr.com/help/video/#1899">pro accounts can upload videos</a>. The maximum time length for any video is 90 seconds, though this is a limitation that has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/video/#2214">less to with technology and more to do with aesthetics</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about Flickr Video at the <a href="http://flickr.com/help/video/">FAQ page</a> and check it out in practice at the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/video/">Video! Video! Video!</a> Flickr group. Also, be sure to take note of the <a href="http://flickr.com/help/video/#2191">CC-shout out</a> in reference to flexibly licensed music -- see more on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/legalmusicforvideos">legal music for videos</a> page.</p>
