Jump on over to the site to enter the <a href="http://simulatedcomicproduct.com/2008/03/12/scp-remix-contest/" title="SCP remix contest details">remix contest</a> that's running until March 24:</p>
<blockquote><p>To celebrate the upcoming book launch, weâ€™re going to have a contest! Have you ever read an SCP strip and thought â€œI can do better than thatâ€? Maybe you have an idea for a better punchline. Or maybe you could make it funnier by redrawing all of the panels in crayon. Or maybe you could combine panels from different strips to make something completely new. Now is your chance! Make an SCP remix, and post it in the comments to this post before the cutoff date on March 24.</p></blockquote>
<p>An SCP poll will be posted to pick the winner, and the top three entries will be featured in a blog post. The author of the winning entry will get a free, signed copy of the book! Awesome.</p>
