<p><a href="http://www.groundreport.com">Ground Report</a> is a new citizen journalism site that "<a href="http://www.groundreport.com/launch">Empowers Global Users to Self-Publish, Rate Content and Earn Money</a>." In a move that helps insure user generated content can flourish on the web, they bolster their reputation and community participation by licensing all user-generated content under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution license</a>.</p>
<p>I've been working with them for only a short time and said this about their project <a href="http://www.groundreport.com/launch">in their press release</a>: "GroundReport empowers authors at the grassroots level. It provides a vital link in the 'ecosystem of sharing' that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> enables through its licenses, which allow sharing, reuse, and remix - legally." </p>
<p>And, as I underlined in the above statement, as more sites come online like <a href="http://groundreport.com">Ground Report</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7269">Metaweb's Freebase</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7224">Technorati's Where's the Fire</a>, it is of the utmost importance to license content clearly and properly, so that interlinking and cross-promotion are built in and automagically happening across the large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem">ecosystem</a> we call the web.</p>
