<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/NYC_Salon">Creative Commons Salon NYC</a> is back in action on March 3rd at the <a href="http://openplans.org/">Open Planning Project</a>'s uber cool penthouse space from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17709">October</a>. The theme for this salon is "Opening Education", and if you don't really know what that means, think CC licenses as applied to various learning contexts and you're off to a good start. To learn more, come by for a good time and free (as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_beer">beer</a>) beer. The basic line-up is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/our-team">Eric Frank</a>, founder and Chief Marketing Officer of <a href="http://flatworldknowledge.com">Flat World Knowledge</a>, a commercial textbook publishing company that is leveraging CC licenses as part of their business model---basically offering free digital textbooks via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>, but charging for the prints and supplementary materials. (Is this business model working? Come and find out!) Eric was previously "Director of Marketing for Prentice Hall Business Publishing, a division with annual sales in the hundreds of millions."</li>
<li><a href="http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;facEmId=npaharia">Neeru Paharia</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://p2pu.org">the Peer 2 Peer University</a><a href="http://p2pu.org"> (P2PU)</a>, a grassroots education project that moves learning outside of institutional walls (for free) by leveraging the internet, social software, and CC licensed content. Neeru is formerly the Executive Director of Creative Commons and is finishing up her doctorate at the Harvard Business School in <a href="http://p2pu.org/BE-Outline">Behavioral Economics</a>.</li>
<li>A panel of K-12 technologists/educators on the cutting edge of their fields who incorporate CC licenses and social media into their classrooms. They will give a run-down on what they do, how they do it, and answer questions about the challenges they face from curious folk like you. The panel consists of:Â  <a title="http://www.davidbill.org/" href="http://www.davidbill.org/">Dave Bill</a>, Technology Integrator at the Dwight School and <a title="http://tedxnyed.com" href="http://tedxnyed.com/">TEDxNYED</a> organizer; <a title="http://www.21apples.org/" href="http://www.21apples.org/">arvind s grover</a>, co-host of <a title="http://edtechtalk.com/21cl" href="http://edtechtalk.com/21cl">21st Century Learning</a> (a podcast about... 21st century learning) and Director of Technology at the Hewitt School (also a <a title="http://tedxnyed.com" href="http://tedxnyed.com/">TEDxNYED</a> organizer); and <a title="http://www.brooklynfriends.org/RelId/611438/ISvars/default/Kerri_Richardson_Redding_Talks_Tech.htm" href="http://www.brooklynfriends.org/RelId/611438/ISvars/default/Kerri_Richardson_Redding_Talks_Tech.htm">Kerri Richardson Redding</a>, Director of Academic Technology at the <a title="http://blogs.brooklynfriends.org/" href="http://blogs.brooklynfriends.org/">Brooklyn Friends School</a>.</li>
