<p>The legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RU_Sirius">R.U. Sirius</a> has a really great podcast called the <a href="http://www.rusiriusradio.com/">R.U. Sirius Show</a>. The most recent episode features an interview with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dantheautomator">Dan the Automator</a>, the producer behind such projects as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Octagon">Dr. Octagon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handsome_Boy_Modeling_School">Handsome Boy Modeling School</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltron_3030">Deltron 3030</a>, and the first <a href="http://www.gorillaz.com/">Gorillaz</a> album. The Automator, who contributed the CC-licensed track "Relaxation Spa Treatment" to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/"><i>Wired</i> CD</a>, had some interesting things to say about copyright, sampling, and Creative Commons in the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Y]ou could never do [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_concrete">Musique concr&eacute;te</a>] at this juncture in time because itâ€™s too expensive. It canâ€™t exist. Youâ€™re losing a form of music. So I felt like I would like to at least contribute to the side of things where â€” if people do want to use something, or chop it up, they can do that. The thought that goes into that kind of stuff can bring out new ideas. And that will bring about more different kinds of music. Iâ€™d hate to see that whole thing go away.
