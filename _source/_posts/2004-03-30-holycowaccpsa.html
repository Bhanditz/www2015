<p>Filmmaker Andy Pavis has made an eight-minute-long public service announcement about Creative Commons and our mission, entitled <a href="http://www.msp.sfsu.edu/intensive/cabaya/dvi_info/clips/pavis_somerightsreserved001.mov">Some Rights Reserved</a>.  Andy cleverly frames the copyright debate between two extremes in the context of a talk show hosted by "Larry Commons." The PSA then explores an example of Aaron, a musician who goes through the process of choosing a license to put his song into the commons.  The PSA ends on an inspiring note when a filmmaker, a dancer, and a musician find Aaron's song and build upon it.  The PSA itself is licensed under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike</a> license -- so feel free to distribute noncommercially, or even remix as long as you give Andy credit.</p>
