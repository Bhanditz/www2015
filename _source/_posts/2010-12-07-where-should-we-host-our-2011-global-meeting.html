<p>It's been almost <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCi_Legal_Day_2008">three years</a> since the CC community last met in person, adjacent a larger event in Sapporo, Japan. For such a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics">rapidly growing</a> and evolving network of experts and volunteers, the time is more than ripe to meet again in 2011. As we start earnestly planning for the event, we are asking ourselves <strong>where we should meet and whether it's possible to find a co-host for the event</strong>.</p>
<p>To this end, CC has posted a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Meeting_2011">request for proposals</a> inviting interested organizations to apply to co-host the next global CC meeting, ideally co-located with another relevant event. The meeting will be held in the third quarter of 2011, bringing together the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/Affiliates">CC Affiliate Network</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people">CC board and staff</a>, key stakeholders and many others to<strong> engage strategically on issues related to the future of our shared commons and to further build CCâ€™s vital community.</strong> Moreover, we'll be identifying opportunities to collaborate on mutual projects, as well as celebrating our successes and exchanging experiences as we conclude our eighth year together.</p>
<p>Importantly, the meeting will include sessions that are open to the public as well as CC affiliate sessions. This will provide a meaningful way to connect local initiatives with our global network of legal experts and community leaders. The CC Global Meeting 2011 is a major focus this coming year, and we look to partner with a strong, well-connected host that can help CC fundraise and organize the event.</p>
<p>The ideal location must be easily reached from a major international airport, readily accessible by public transportation, equipped with appropriate conference venues and affordable lodging, and offer easy and inexpensive travel visas. Proposals should address fundraising to cover costs of the event and travel for principal participants.</p>
<p>We're accepting proposals to co-host and co-organize the meeting through a lightweight proposal process, open until 2011 January 10. If you're interested in submitting a proposal, our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Meeting_2011">wiki page provides</a> further details. Contact 2011global [at] creativecommons.org for more information.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you in 2011!</p>
