<p><strong>Update: Please be sure to apply at the <a href="http://www.google.com/policyfellowship/apply.html">Google Policy Fellowship website</a>.<br />
</strong><br />
For the fifth year, Creative Commons will take part in the <a href="http://www.google.com/policyfellowship">Google Policy Fellowship</a> program. It's fantastic to see that Google has expanded the number and diversity of groups involved in the fellowship program. This year there are <a href="http://policybythenumbers.blogspot.com/2013/02/apply-for-2013-google-policy-fellowship.html">participating organizations</a> from Africa, Latin America, Europe and North America. </p>
<blockquote><p>The Google Policy Fellowship program offers undergraduate, graduate, and law students interested in Internet and technology policy the opportunity to spend the summer contributing to the public dialogue on these issues, and exploring future academic and professional interests. Fellows will have the opportunity to work at public interest organizations at the forefront of debates on broadband and access policy, content regulation, copyright and trademark reform, consumer privacy, open government, and more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 2013 Google Policy Fellow will receive a grant to work at Creative Commonsâ€™ office in Mountain View, California. </p>
<p>Past CC Google Policy Fellows have worked on a wide variety of projects. These have included surveying intellectual property and licensing policies of philanthropic foundations, research on the welfare impact of Creative Commons across various fields, and an investigation of the characterization of Creative Commons within U.S. legal scholarship. </p>
<p>We look for motivated candidates with partially-developed ideas in exploring a particular interest/expertise area, short research project, or related activity within the broad spectrum of open licensing and the commons. In 2013 we are particularly interested in working with fellows interested in supporting education and advocacy efforts around open policies so that publicly funded resources are openly licensed resources. One specific project we are looking for assistance on is the development of an <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Open_Policy_Network">Open Policy Network</a>. We are very flexible in accommodating project ideas that will be mutually beneficial to the candidate and CC. The project work with CC will not be supervised by an attorney. </p>
<p><strong>Please be sure to apply before March 15, 2013, and good luck.<br />
</strong></p>
