<p>Creative Commons makes a cameo appearance in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/business/03yahoo.html?ex=1285992000&en=73ae4d4eda58b32a&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times article</a> about the just announced <a href="http://www.opencontentalliance.org/">Open Content Alliance</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to copyrighted materials, the newly formed group appears to be taking a more cautious approach by seeking permission from copyright holders and by making works available though a Creative Commons license, whereby the copyright holder stipulates how a work can be used.<br />
<br />...<br />
<br />Richard Terdiman, a professor of literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said the Creative Commons approach appeared less likely to antagonize copyright holders.</p></blockquote>
<p>What's cool about this is that CC is explained incredibly succinctly and accurately (or do we require no extended explanation these days?) and positioned, again <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/history">accurately</a>, as a moderate and balanced option.</p>
