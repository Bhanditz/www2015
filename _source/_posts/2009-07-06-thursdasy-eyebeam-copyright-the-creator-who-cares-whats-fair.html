</a>If you are in New York on Thursday this week, you are invited <a href="http://eyebeam.org/feeds/jon-cohrs/copyright-and-the-creator-who-cares-what%E2%80%99s-fair">to a panel I've helped organize with our friends at Eyebeam on fair use and creators</a>. I'll also be moderating the panel and giving a brief primer on fair use:</p>
<blockquote><p>This Thursday, July 9, 6â€“8PM at <a href="http://eyebeam.org/">Eyebeam</a>, there will be a panel discussion on fair-use and appropriation within activist and creative practice moderated by Creative Commons product manager and Eyebeam research associate <a href="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/" target="_blank">Fred Benenson</a>; artist/curator <a href="http://www.marktribe.net/" target="_blank">Mark Tribe</a>, audio-visual remix artist Jonny Wilson (<a href="http://www.eclecticmethod.net/" target="_blank">Eclectic Method)</a>, <a href="http://www.postmastersart.com/" target="_blank">Postmasters gallery </a>director Magdalena Sawon, and Eyebeam resident <a href="http://eyebeam.org/people/jon-cohrs">Jon Cohrs</a>.</p></blockquote>
<div>The panel is part of <a href="http://eyebeam.org/events/eyebeam-summer-school-night">Eyebeam's Summer School @ Night program</a>. And in case you don't know, <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org">Eyebeam</a>, is one of the preeminent spaces for digital art and many of its residents and fellows create works that <a href="http://eyebeam.org/research/open-cultures">investigate many of the issues</a> that we're interested in at CC. But more on that later. :)</div>
