<p>I'm thrilled to announce that we've met <a href="https://www.safecreative.org/home.shtml?cid=33934">Safe Creative's</a> matching challenge 4 days before the deadline! Thanks to everyone who took advantage of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10135">Safe Creative's generous offer</a> to match all donations up to $4000. Instead of raising $4000 we raised $8000 -- which will help us continue providing the world with the tools you so readily rely upon.</p>
<p>If you have yet to <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">donate to CC by joining the CC Network</a>, please consider doing so now. There are only two months left in the campaign and we still need to raise $438,958. Here's a brief list of ways you can help; for more options check out our <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/other">Other Ways to Give</a> page:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">Join the CC Network</a></li>
<li> Increase the value of your donation by participating in your company's matching gifts program</li>
<li> Buy swag from the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/store">CC store</a></li>
<li> Send us a gift of stock</li>
<li> Encourage the company you work for to consider becoming a corporate sponsor</li>
<li> Promote the campaign on your blog and encourage your readers to give via the CC widget</li>
</ul>
<p>CC exists for you &mdash; help keep us running so you can continue to use our tools to help build and sustain a shared culture. Special thanks to Safe Creative and to the hundreds of CC community members who are participating in the campaign &mdash; your support is greatly appreciated. </p>
