<p><a href="http://www.flickrleech.net/">flickrleech</a> is a great tool for those looking to search a large number of flickr photos at once - by utilizing Flickr's API, flickrleech is able to display 200 images per page rather than the standard 10. As pointed out by <a href="http://www.trustyetc.com/trustyblog/2008/10/08/flickleech-now-with-creative-commons/">Alvin Trusty</a>, it simply "makes scanning for a picture much quicker." </p>
<p>While flickrleech has been around for a while, a new update has added the ability to search for photos by CC license. For those who scour Flickr searching for the perfect CC-licensed image, this functionality should mean less time spent searching and an immediately wider selection to choose from. Check it out for yourself <a href="http://www.flickrleech.net/">here</a><span class="lol"></span>.</p>
