<p>For those in the New York area tonight, tune in to WFUV (90.7), which is broadcast from Fordham University, at 9:30pm (Eastern Time) for an an hour-long program examining how the race to get  online affects not only musicians, but music fans and the music business in general.</p>
<p>The program will feature interviews with Creative Commons own former Executive Director - Glenn Otis Brown - as well as The New Yorker Pop Music Critic Sasha Frere-Jones, CDBaby.com Founder Derek Sivers, Berklee School of Music Vice President David  Kusek among others.</p>
<p>Those of us not in the New York area can, of course, still catch the show online on the <a href="http://www.wfuv.org/">WFUV website</a>.</p>
