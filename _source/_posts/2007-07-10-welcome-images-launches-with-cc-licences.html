From <a href="http://images.wellcome.ac.uk/indexplus/page/News.html">their press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Launched on 15 June 2007, 'Wellcome Images' is the world's leading source of images on the history of medicine, modern biomedical science and clinical medicine.

<p>This is absolutely amazing news.

By utilizing CC-licensing, Wellcome Images is more able to fully realize the true spirit of academia - an unblocked and open pursuit of knowledge and understanding.</p>
