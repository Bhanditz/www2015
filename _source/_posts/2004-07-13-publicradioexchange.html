<p>The Washington Post has a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29919-2004Jul5.html">nice article</a> about the innovative and all-around-fantastic <a href="http://prx.org">Public Radio Exchange</a> today.  PRX bills itself as "an online service for peer-review and digital distribution of public radio programming": it's a low-friction clearinghouse for great radio.  In the words of the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every minute of every hour, great gobs of fantastic, imaginative and compelling programs are being produced. Unfortunately, listeners rarely hear or learn of them.</p>
<p>Producing radio programming is easier than ever before, thanks to digital technology. Still, independent producers face the perennial problem of how to distribute their creations, catch the attention of network and station programmers and, most important, get paid for their work.</p>
<p>Enter PRX -- the Public Radio Exchange, a fledgling nonprofit Web site based in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out <a href="http://prx.org">PRX</a> for a glimpse of the future of radio, and watch for more interesting things from them very soon.</p></p>
