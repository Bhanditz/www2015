<p>Thanks to all who donated this week and had your gift automatically doubled by <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/">Hindawi</a>! Your $3000 in donations have become $6000 thanks to Hindawi.</p>
<p>Here's why the open access scholarly journal publisher supports CC:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindawi.com/"><img src="img/Hindawi-Logo-Web-10.jpg" alt="" title="Hindawi-Logo-Web-10" width="75" height="73" class="alignright size-full wp-image-24457" style="margin-right:30px" /></a><em>"As an open access journal publisher we believe that it is important for our readers to be comfortable reusing and redistributing our articles without fear of violating any copyright restrictions, and Creative Commons licenses make it clear to readers what they can do with our content."</em></p>
<p>Many thanks to Hindawi and all those who donated to our fundraising campaign this week. We still need your help to reach our $550,000 goal by December 31 so please <a href="https://www.creativecommons.net/donate">donate today</a> and show the world you care about an open, sharing world - online and off!</p>
