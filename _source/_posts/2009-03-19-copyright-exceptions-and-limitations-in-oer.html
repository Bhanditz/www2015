<p>For those of you interested in knowing how Copyright Exceptions and Limitations (known as Fair Use in the US) might affect open educational resources, there will be a working session on CEL at <a href="http://ocw.itesm.mx/ocwcglobal2009/">OCWC Global 2009</a> in Monterrey, Mexico next month. OCWC Global 2009 is the OpenCourseWare Consortiumâ€™s first international conference of its kind. The session on International Copyright Exceptions and Limitations may include current US work exploring issues of <a href="http://wiki.ocwconsortium.org/index.php?title=Fair_Use_Working_Group">Fair Use in OER</a>, but is, naturally, a much larger conversation encompassing many different legal jurisdictions. From the <a href="http://wiki.ocwconsortium.org/index.php?title=Copyright_Exceptions_and_Limitations">CEL wiki</a>,</p>
<p>"<em>The realm of copyright exceptions and limitations is vast and complex. Every legal jurisdiction has its own formulation of what behaviors are exempt from copyright restrictions, and we have only begun to explore the question of how open licensing affects those formulations.</em>"</p>
<p>Since we have yet to sort out which aspects of the CEL landscape ccLearn can reasonably investigate, and which partners are interested in being collaborators, we hope this working session will result in some great initial inquires into this international issue. To join a discussion of some of these topics, <a href="http://wiki.ocwconsortium.org/index.php?title=Copyright_Exceptions_and_Limitations">contribute</a> to the wiki! You can also find out more at the <a href="http://ocwblog.org/2009/03/19/working-session-on-international-copyright-exceptions-and-limitations-at-ocwc-global-2009/">OCW Blog</a>.</p>
