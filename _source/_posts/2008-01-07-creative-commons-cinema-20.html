<p>Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ1nFswOl5U">this great YouTube clip</a> we got e-mailed over the holidays, cut entirely of footage and sound from <em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7775">The Tracey Fragments</a></em>. It was made to celebrate what the creator and editor, Toi Matteucci, saw as "Cinema 2.0.", the reuse of footage from one film (in this case <em>The Tracey Fragments</em>) to create a new work with an entirely different purpose.</p>
