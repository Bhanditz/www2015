<p><a href="http://artabase.net/">Artabase</a> is a beta social networking site for the arts community that "aims to become the world's best online database of art history" by turning contemporary event listings into a growing database of artistic happenings. Artabase's concept is based around a collective definition of history, and as such, they recently adopted CC-licences in their uploading process for images - keeping their imagery as open as their text. Artabase joins <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7584">Rhizome.org</a>, amongst others in the online art world, in embracing CC-licensing.</p>
