<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/inbusiness/inbusiness_20090108.shtml"><img alt="" src="img/banner_left.gif" class="alignleft" width="300" height="90" /></a>A couple interviews with CC board and staff have surfaced in the last week or two. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/inbusiness/inbusiness_20090108.shtml">BBC Radio 4 interviewed Creative Commons Board Chair James Boyle</a> about the public domain and how Creative Commons helps enrich the environment of the mind. Before Jamie's interview, the Beeb chats with Chris Anderson talks about his new book FREE and the business models he's been researching.</p>
<p>In December, our Creative Director, <a href="http://blogs.bnet.com/dogandpony/?p=143">Eric Steuer talked with Dog and Pony of The BNET Business Network</a>.  The Knight Foundation's Knight Pulse also <a href="http://www.knightpulse.org/blog/08/12/16/how-can-licensing-give-creators-control-over-use-their-work">interviewed Eric about how grantees can use our licenses in their projects</a>.</p>
<p>I also answered some questions from Journalism.co.uk <a href="http://www.journalism.co.uk/5/articles/533141.php">regarding how journalists can use CC licenses in their work</a>. Finally, I chatted with <a href="http://www.federalnewsradio.com/index.php?sid=1569136&nid=364">Federal News Radio on Friday about Obama's choice to use CC on Change.gov</a>, the recording of which you can download there.</p>
