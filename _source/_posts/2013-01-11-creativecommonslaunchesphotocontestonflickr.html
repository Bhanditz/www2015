<p><i>Winnersâ€™ Photos to Be Featured on CC Postcards; Winners Can Also Choose a CC Board Member to Record a Personalized Outgoing Voicemail Message</i></p>
<p><b>San Francisco, CA â€” November 8, 2006</b></p>
<p>Today, Creative Commons announced the launch of the first <a href="http://plone.creativecommons.org:7080/cc/weblog/entry/6137">CC Swag Photo Contest</a> on Flickr. The contest is part of Creative Commonsâ€™ <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support">Annual Fundraising Campaign</a> and runs through December 18, 2006. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">Contest information</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest_rules">rules</a> can be found on Creative Commons <a href=" http://creativecommons.org/support">support page</a>.</p>
<p>The CC Swag photo contest challenges people to creatively photograph Creative Commons T-shirts, buttons, stickers, and other promotional items (all available at CCâ€™s <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/store">online store</a>) and enter their photos by uploading them to the Flickr group <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ccswagcontest06/">CCSwagcontest06</a>.</p>
<p>Two winners, as chosen by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people">Creative Commons staff</a>, will have their photos used on Creative Commons' informational postcards, which will be distributed internationally to promote CC and the winning photographers. Winners will receive 100 copies of the postcard that features their photo. The winners will also be able to choose a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people">board member</a> to record a personalized outgoing voicemail announcement.</p>
<p><b>About Creative Commons</b></p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licences provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various organizations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as members of the public.
