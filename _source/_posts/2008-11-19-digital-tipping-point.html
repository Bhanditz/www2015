The footage is available for free at their <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/digitaltippingpoint">archive.org page</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The DTP crew describes their project as a Point-of-View (POV) documentary film about the rapidly growing global shift to open source software, and the effects that massive wave of technological change will have on literacy, art, and culture around the world.</p>
<p>The DTP crew says their project will be the first feature length documentary about free open source software to be built in an open source fashion out of video submitted to the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The DTP crew invites you to take their video and rip, mix and burn it however you like, for whatever purpose you like. You can even use the footage for your own commercial film, as long as you release your final product under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribute-ShareAlike license</a>.</p></blockquote>
