<p><a href="http://downhillbattle.org/index.php?p=154">Downhill Battle</a> and <a href="http://p2pnet.net/story/1679">p2pnet</a> have announced a new <a href="http://moviesformusic.org/enter.php">video contest</a>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The goal is to encourage people to make short movies and animations about the music industry, filesharing, and the potential we have to change the system. The right video can be the best way to explain these issues and get someone involved, and as always we like to hit from every direction we can. Please tell all your video artist friends!</p></blockquote>
