<p><a href="http://digium.com"><img src="img/digium.gif" alt="digium" title="digium" width="120" height="75" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17054" /></a><a href="http://www.digium.com">Digium</a>, the parent company that hosts and maintains the open source telephony & PBX project called <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a>, recently replaced the on-hold music featured in their distributions to CC BY-SA licensed works from <a href="http://opsound.org">OpSound</a>. Using freely licensed CC music in open source projects has always made sense to us, but Digium's <a href="http://blogs.digium.com/author/jtodd/">John Todd</a> discusses why they finally made <a href="http://blogs.digium.com/2009/08/18/asterisk-music-on-hold-changes/">the switch on the company's blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In some nations (Australia and France, to pick two that have been brought to our attention) there are some who are claiming that we do not have the rights outlined above, and that our users therefore are in a similar situation where they may be in violation of license terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>John goes on to explain that since CC licenses are easy to use, well defined, and accepted internationally, the choice was clear to them:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is very far outside of Digiumâ€™s ability or interest to manage, nor do we wish to become involved in the protracted series of legal proceedings required to sort out this licensing issue.  So we have chosen another path that is more clear to us: we will eliminate the files of questionable license from Asterisk, and <strong>replace them with music that has clearly defined and more acceptable licensing terms which are compatible with both the Asterisk license, and with any reasonable redistribution methods that might be used by others who re-package Asterisk</strong>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Just think, the next time you get placed on hold, there's a good chance you'll be listening to some copyleft music!</p>
