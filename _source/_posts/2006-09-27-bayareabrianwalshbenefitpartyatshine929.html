<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.shinesf.com/">Shine</a>, where Creative Commons holds its <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/91070">San Francisco CC Salon</a> events, are holding a benefit party this Friday (9/29) for Brian Walsh, who is the man behind Shine's super cool <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shinesf/">Flickr photo booth</a> (now with CC licensing!) Brian's house was broken into recently and some of his equipment was stolen -- his friends are trying to raise enough money to get him back in business. More info on the <a href="http://www.shinesf.com/blog/">Shine blog</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>So come by this Friday anytime after 6 pm, we've got more and more people coming to spin and help out, and all the proceeds are going straight to Brian so he can get a new laptop and get back to work!</p></blockquote>
