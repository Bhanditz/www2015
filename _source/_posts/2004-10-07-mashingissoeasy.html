<p>This week in San Francisco, there's an interesting conference being held called <a href="http://www.web2con.com/">Web 2.0</a>. In a week of panel discussions, the future of the internet is being charted among technology and industry leaders. <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000627.html">Jeff Veen recalls a discussion of copyright</a> among music industry folks including famous mash-up artist DJ Dangermouse. After a lot of hand-wringing by the record execs, DJ Dangermouse dropped some obvious knowledge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mashing is so easy. It takes years to learn how to play the guitar and write your own songs. It takes a few weeks of practice with turntable to make people dance and smile. It takes a few hours to crank out something good with some software. So with such a low barrier to entry, everyone jumps in and starts immediately being creative. I don't understand why that is illegal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jason Calacanis has <a href="http://web20.weblogsinc.com/entry/3633175652806153/">recorded audio of the talk</a> on his site (and just for kicks, someone should probably mash it over some beats :).</p>
