<p>We've heard fantastic feedback about our internships over the years. Here's what a few students had to say about their San Franciscan summers in the CC office:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I wanted to spend my summer doing something important and socially responsible, so interning at Creative Commons was an obvious choice for me.  What wasn't obvious until I started working was just how much I would learn about copyright law, software development, and how effective nonprofits operate.  With just a handful of staff in the San Francisco office, all of them friendly and welcoming, I quickly felt like a valued member of the team.  I was given ample opportunity to meet and chat with CC staff as well as with staff and interns at peer organizations such as the Electronic Frontiers Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology.  The people that I met that summer continue to be great friends and valuable resources who generously offer their mentorship in my post-CC work."<br />&mdash; <em><a href="http://madebyparker.com/">Parker Phinney</a>, Tech Intern 2009</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Working at CC provided a complete immersion into how the organization operates, and made clear why CC has become such an important part of the online licensing landscape.  In addition to specific projects and tasks, I had plenty of autonomy and opportunity to get involved in other projects or just chat about new ideas.  The staff were accessible and encouraging.  I'm grateful for the opportunity to participate in such a challenging and rewarding environment.  In addition to legal research and project development, there were many opportunities to meet other organizations in the area, visit their offices, and interact with a range of students and professionals.  I can't think of a better way to spend the summer."<br />&mdash; <em>Joe Merante, Legal Intern 2009</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"My internship with Creative Commons was probably the most fruitful and definitely the most enjoyable of my student career. I spent my time in a close-knit small-office environment, with a bunch of passionate people working on interesting real-world problems. At CC everyone is a little bit techie, a little bit law geek, a little bit free culture activist, and a whole lot of awesome. It's an amazing place to be, and as internships go, I can't recommend any other more highly."<br />&mdash; <em><a href="http://www.constrainedblisspoint.com/">Frank Tobia</a>, Tech Intern 2008</em></p></blockquote>
