<p>Book Magazine recently published <a href="http://www.bookmagazine.com/issue29/best.html">a list of the 50 best-selling classics in 2002</a>, and blogger Eliot Landrum decided to improve upon it. He looked up the date that every book on the list is set to go into the public domain in the US (10 of the 50 already are), and <a href="http://eliot.landrum.cx/archives/2003/08/21/classic_bestsellers.php">republished the list here</a>.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see what kinds of great side-stories, reinterpretations, and movies get created after Tolkien's, Steinbeck's, and Hemingway's work goes free.</p>
