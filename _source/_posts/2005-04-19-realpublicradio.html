<p><a href="http://www.rprn.org/index.jsp">Real Public Radio Network</a> is a non-profit group with a site aggregating audio in talk, music, and other formats. They offer Creative Commons licenses to uploaders and have <a href="http://www.rprn.org:8080/entertherabbit.html">an amusing animated short</a> explaining the process.</p>
