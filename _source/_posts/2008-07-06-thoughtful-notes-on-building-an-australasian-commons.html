<p>Wikimedia Commons editor and Australian Brianna Laugher <a href="http://brianna.modernthings.org/article/111/ccau-building-an-australasian-commons-conference-notes">wrote up some thoughtful notes on Creative Commons Australia's recent conference</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonetheless, what can we learn from how CC conducts itself? I canâ€™t speak for the other jurisdictions, but the Australian one is damn impressive. They do an incredible amount of gently-gently lobbying for the adoption of free content licenses and open access policies in a general sense, without only pushing their own licenses. They educate government, cultural and educational institutions about what CC is and how to use it. The Australian clinic started the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Casestudies">Case studies</a> project, which is a brilliant way of showcasing their successes and â€œnormalisingâ€ the use of CC for organisations who are hesitant to jump on board. With this kind of index, they can easily find a similar-enough group that has already made the leap and make an assessment of how successful it was for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">CC Australia</a> is awesome.</p>
