<p>Last featured on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4058">CC Remix Music</a> was <a href="http://www.funktifyno.com/">Funktifyno</a>, a great fusion jam band based in Oregon.  <a href="http://www.cministries.org/cstudios/cstudios.htm">Chris Morris,</a> based in Texas, read our blog and turned their song <a href="http://www.funktifyno.com/mp3/Funkberry_Jam.mp3">Funkberry Jam</a> into <a href="http://www.cministries.org/cstudios/funktifynomo.htm"> Funkberrymo Jam</a> by adding a keyboard track-- how's that for jamming on the Net?</p>
<p>
Today we are featuring <a href="http://www.hollandhopson.net">Holland Hopson's</a> song <a href="http://www.hollandhopson.net/music/one4one/02_Cuckoo.mp3">Cuckoo</a>, a peaceful and melodic flow on the saxophone.  Though thorougly beautiful in its current state, it lends itself to the potential of an added drum beat, possibly changing the spirit of the  song entirely -- care to remix?</p>
