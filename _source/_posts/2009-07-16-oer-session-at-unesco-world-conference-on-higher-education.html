<p>As part of <a href="http://www.unesco.org/en/education/single-view/news/world_conference_on_higher_education_closes_with_an_appeal_for_investment_and_cooperation/back/9712/">UNESCO's World Conference on Higher Education</a>, UNESCO hosted a session and panel discussion on open educational resources (OER).  The topic of the conference was "The New Dynamics of Higher Education and Research for Societal Change and Development," and OER was considered an important dynamic in higher education. The conference took place over four days, ending on July 8, with over 1200 participants from 150 countries. </p>
<p>The OER session took place on July 7, 2009, and the summary is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Building Knowledge Societies: Open Educational Resources Panel session</p>
<p>This conference aims to take stock of transformations in higher education since the 1998 World Conference on Higher Education and address the new dynamics likely to shape the strategic agenda for the development of higher education policies and institutions.</p>
<p>The growing Open Educational Resources (OER) movement has the objective of increasing access to quality educational content worldwide.  Digital content that is open to re-use and adaptation is a public good that can be shared widely.  The panel session is intended to explore OER as an example of a new dynamic in higher education that will contribute to building knowledge societies."</p></blockquote>
<p>The final <a href="http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/ED/pdf/WCHE_2009/FINAL%20COMMUNIQUE%20WCHE%202009.pdf ">CommuniquÃ©</a> of the conference is available online. The CommuniquÃ© states some of the following conclusions: </p>
<blockquote><p>"There is need for greater information, openness and transparency regarding the different missions and performance of individual institutions." </p>
<p>"ODL (Open and Distance Learning) approaches and ICTs present opportunities to widen access to quality education, particularly when Open Educational Resources are readily shared by many countries and higher education institutions."</p></blockquote>
<p>The global nature of OER is integral to their quality and value. OER that allow adaptation, derivation, and redistribution encourage global activity like translation, transcontinental collaboration, and more. If OER produced from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15818">American Graduation Initiative</a> are licensed to allow these freedoms, U.S. college courses become global, thereby increasing their quality and value.</p>
