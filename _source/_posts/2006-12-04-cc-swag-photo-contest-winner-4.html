<p>We are happy to announce that this weeks' winner of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">CC Swag Contest</a> is Cambodia4kids with her picture titled <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cambodia4kidsorg/312407445/in/pool-ccswagcontest06/">"Creative Commons"</a>. I've set a precedent over the past couple of weeks of stating a bit of our reasoning behind choosing the winning photographs and how we responded to each winners' creative use of CC Swag in conjunction with our mission.</p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cambodia4kidsorg/312407445/"><img align="left" alt="Creative Commons" style="margin-right: 5px" src="img/312407445_282cfa40fc_m.jpg" /></a> I think her comment below her photograph "When they grow up, they will understand the power of the "By" license" coupled with the photograph itself communicates our mission more effectively than I would ever be able to with my own words. We are all impressed and inspired by Cambodia4kids.org (Beth's) entry and thank her for participating and for sharing her photograph.</p>
<p>There are only 2 weeks left before the final 2 winners are announced so we encourage everyone to participate. If you for some reason don't want to participate, we encourage you to check out all the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ccswagcontest06/pool/">entries</a> thus far to see what interesting and cool photographs have been shared. If you do want to participate check out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">rules</a> and then start shooting! Share and disseminate CC's message by using your photographic skills and help bring attention to this movement for a participatory global culture.</p>
