This week's featured content is the open-source film "<a href="http://www.nothingsostrange.com/open_source/">Nothing So Strange</a>." While   the whole film is protected by full copyright, <a href="http://www.nothingsostrange.com/open_source/assassination.html">individual clips can be downloaded</a> for a nominal fee (a few cents in most cases), with the film's footage available for reuse, remix, and commercial use in any other work provided attribution is given.</p>
<p>
It's an interesting experiment in both filmmaking and micropayments.</p>
