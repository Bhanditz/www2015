<p>After a brilliant <a href="http://ccsalon.tistory.com/10">CC Salon in Seoul</a> at the beginning of May, Judge Jongsoo (Jay) Yoon, sent me a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/62365517@N00/sets/72157600233484678/">URL with the most media I've seen captured from one salon</a>. I wish I could have been there to eat some good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap">bibimbap</a> or other dish and talk <a href="http://www.creativecommons.or.kr/">CC Korea</a> (1 of the 36 CC Project Jurisdictions) :)</p>
<p>And, like I've said many times, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/All_Salons">anyone can start a CC Salon where they'd like</a>: Help CC Spread!<br />
This is what Tim Cowlishaw is doing in London. He is <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-community/2007-May/001836.html">organizing the first CC Salon London</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creative Commons, the Open Rights Group and Free Culture UK are pleased to<br />
announce the first London CC-Salon event, to be held in Shoreditch on<br />
Thursday 28th June 2007.</p>
<p>The CC Salon is a monthly event focused  on building a community of artists<br />
and developers around Creative Commons  licenses, standards, and technology,<br />
and have been running with great success in cities around the world,<br />
including San Francisco, Berlin  and Johannesberg. All are welcome,<br />
especially anyone interested in Creative Commons, copyright, Free Culture,<br />
Open Source, art, media, and music.</p>
<p>CC-Salon will held on the last Thursday  of every month, at Juno, 135<br />
Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JE, from 6.30pm until midnight. The June<br />
event will feature contributions from:</p>

<p>Jonathan Roberts (FreeMeDVD - <a href="http://questionsplease.org/freeme">http://questionsplease.org/freeme</a>)</p>
<p>and after-dinner.net DJs</p>
<p>In addition, we've got 100 free Magnatune.com &lt;<a href="http://magnatune.com/">http://magnatune.com/</a>&gt; gift<br />

CC-licenced music.</p>
<p>There's plenty more planned for future events, and we'd love to hear from<br />
anyone interested in participating,  whether by performing, exhibiting work,<br />
or giving a talk or presentation.  Please email <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community">tim at ccsalon-london.org.uk</a> if<br />
