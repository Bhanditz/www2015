<p>Today at <a href="http://sxsw.com">SXSW</a> in Austin, <a href="http://wiredmag.com">WIRED</a> music editor Eric Steurer, red-hot remix artist <a href="http://www.resetmusic.com/resetweb/reset_music.html">DJ Reset</a>, and I talked on a panel about "Notes from the Underground: The Rise of Remix Culture." As fits the subject, there was some very good audience participation and back-and-forth, and Reset told some good anecdotes about living on the bleeding edge of digital creativity.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://newyorker.com/printable/?critics/050110crmu_music">this recent story</a> on DJ Reset from the New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones.</p>
