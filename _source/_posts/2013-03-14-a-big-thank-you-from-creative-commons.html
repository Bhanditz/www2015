<p>This month marks the end of <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/">Creative Commons' annual fundraising campaign</a>. Thank you so much to everyone who donated or helped spread the word about the campaign.</p>
<p>The past few months have really been a whirlwind for the CC community. We <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">celebrated CC's tenth anniversary around the world</a>, <a href="/weblog/entry/35906">even in Antarctica (!)</a>. We've seen <a href="/weblog/entry/36699">major open legislation</a> introduced in Congress, and a <a href="/weblog/entry/35267">White House directive</a> to get more serious about open access. The community <a href="/weblog/entry/37179">built a new online school</a> where anyone can learn about open. We've <a href="/weblog/entry/36713">entered the final stretch</a> in developing Version 4.0 of the CC licenses. We've <a href="/weblog/entry/36298">mourned the loss of a friend</a>, and <a href="/weblog/entry/37362">are calling for the release of another</a>. And we've done it all hand-in-hand with the global community of commoners.</p>
<p>From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support. Thank you for being a diverse, engaged community. Full steam ahead into the second decade.</p>
<p><em>PS: If you haven't gotten your "Create Share Remix" T-shirt yet, <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/">there are still a few left</a>.</em></p>
