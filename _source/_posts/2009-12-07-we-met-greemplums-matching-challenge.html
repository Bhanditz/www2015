<strong>Thank you</strong> to all who gave a donation to CC over the past week! All gifts were generously doubled by <a href="http://www.greenplum.com/">Greenplum</a>, who matched $5000 of donations to our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">fundraising campaign</a>. We're extremely grateful to Greenplum for their ongoing support of Creative Commons and their dedicated work building digital tools for the 21st century. </p>
<p>We rely on the generosity of our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">corporate and individual supporters</a> to enable us to carry out our mission of facilitating participatory culture, and we hope you will join all those who have already supported CC by <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donating</a></strong> to our annual campaign!</p>
