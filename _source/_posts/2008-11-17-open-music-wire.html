<p><a href="http://openmusicwire.com/">Open Music Wire</a> is a new initiative from <a href="http://musik1.net/">Musik1</a> that promotes CC-licensed music from affiliated net-labels. Most readily seen as a music blog, OMW curates the music they feature on their home page in an effort to shine a light on the songs and artists they find particularly inspiring. All of the music on the site is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND license</a>.</p>
<p>OMW is still in beta, so many of the services aren't fully launched. With that said, it is important to note that although there is a distinct emphasis on OMW's affiliated net-labels, anyone can submit music to their <a href="http://openmusicwire.com/content/">Open Music Library</a> as long as it is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">licensed correctly</a>. Presumably, this music will not only be freely available but also pooled for the curated content on the main page. </p>
