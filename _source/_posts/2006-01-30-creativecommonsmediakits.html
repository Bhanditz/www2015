<p>Last summer, Creative Commons had the pleasure of having <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#44">Fred Benenson</a> as its first <a href="http://www.freeculture.org">Free Culture</a> intern. Fred was tasked with coming up with interesting or cool ways to get out Creative Commons' message but on a grass roots level. </p>
<p>Fred created a very sexy <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/skyfaller/90005384/">media kit</a> that Free Culture members can give to bands at shows or events. The kit includes a flyer explaing CC, a DVD with CC cartoons and videos, and a CD with re-mixed CC licensed music. Our new graphic designer Alex Roberts put on the finishing touches to make it come to life. Nelson Pavlosky, Free Culture's founder, gave out his first one at a World Inferno Friendship Society <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/skyfaller/sets/72057594052345968/">show</a><br />
in Haverford. Nelson reports that the band was friendly to his CC pitch. Thanks for the grass roots efforts.</p>
