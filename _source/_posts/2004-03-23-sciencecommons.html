<p>As we announced in our short film "<a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/reticulum_rex/">Reticulum Rex</a>" and on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3957">this<br />
blog in January</a>, one of Creative Commons' New Year's Resolutions<br />
was to explore a Science Commons -- a new, parallel branch of our<br />
organization dedicated to investigating how our "some rights reserved"<br />
model can be applied to pressing problems in science and the field of biomedical research.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of our Board of Directors and many friends of<br />
Creative Commons, that process is now underway.</p>
<p>We are very excited to announce the launch of the Science Commons<br />
exploratory phase, for which we recently secured funding.</p>
<p>The process will build upon Creative Commons' work in the sciences (e.g., our licensing of <a href="http://plos.org">Public Library of Science</a> publications). But, crucially, Science Commons will delve<br />
into both legal areas (patents, data) and subject matter (biomedicine) outside the scope of our current organization.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/opportunities">We are now seeking a energetic and committed manager</a> to join us long-term and full-time to drive the Science Commons exploratory process -- someone expert in these areas and prepared for the challenge of rearing what may well grow up to be CC's sibling organization. It's a very exciting development.</p>
