<p>After a brief hiatus <a href="http://indieish.com/2006/06/15/the-death-of-indieishcom-has-been-greatly-exaggerated/">cc365 returns</a> with help from <em><a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com">Black Sweater, White Cat</a></em> collaborators Biotic and Subsystem7.</p>
<p>Grant Robertson is also inviting anyone to join Indieish.com (cc365's host):</p>
<blockquote><p>I invite anyone who loves Indiesh.com to <a href="http://indieish.com/wp-register.php">register for an account</a>, and post whatever you like, whenever you like as long as it relates to the progressive domination of the world by Creative Commons means.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're new to cc365 and Indieish.com a good place to start is Grant's <a href="http://indieish.com/2006/05/01/top-ten-so-far-a-look-back-at-indieishcoms-cc365-project/">top ten so far</a>, posted last month after day 120.</p>
<p>BSWC and cc365 have actually been collaborating in a loose sense for over six months, see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5757">this post from January</a>.</p>
<p>Biotic and Subsystem7 talk about the collaboration on last weekend's BSWC, which is also a ccMixter special.  Check out the <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2006/06/bswc-artist-playlist-for-061706.html">playlist</a> and <a href="http://ia300213.us.archive.org/2/items/BSWC20060617/BSWC20060617.mp3">audio file</a>.</p>
