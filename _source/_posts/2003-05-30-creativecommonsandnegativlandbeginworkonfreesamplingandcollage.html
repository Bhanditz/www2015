<p>The Silicon Valley Nonprofit Also Rolls Out New Model for Community<br />
Participation</p>
<p>Palo Alto, California, USA - May 29, 2003 - Creative Commons, a nonprofit<br />
dedicated to building a layer of reasonable copyright, announced today<br />
that it would begin development of the Sampling License, a copyright tool<br />
designed to let artists encourage the creative transformation of their<br />
work, for profit or otherwise. Leading the public discussion and<br />
development of the license is Negativland, practitioners of "found sound"<br />
music as well as other forms of media manipulation. </p>
<p>Glenn Otis Brown, Creative Commons Executive Director, commented: "The<br />
Sampling License is among the most exciting projects we've taken on so<br />
far. The technology and culture of the Net already facilitate the<br />
remixing of culture. The law does not, so we're helping it catch up by<br />
remixing copyright itself." </p>
<p>When completed, the Sampling License will allow people to create collage<br />
art and "mash-ups" - as well as other art forms based on re-used<br />
materials - from licensed works. Like all of Creative Commons copyright<br />
tools, the Sampling License will be made available for free to the public<br />
from the organization's website.</p>
<p>"There's a crucial difference between bootlegging another's work and the<br />
creative transformation of it." Negativland said. "Collage is a technique<br />
that has an undisputed currency in virtually all art forms today.<br />
Originally, copyright was designed to prohibit the piracy or bootlegging<br />
of complete works; that was and remains a worthy goal. But copyright is<br />
now also routinely used to prohibit collage, as if it were no different<br />
from outright piracy. With Creative Commons, we're trying to build a<br />
license that will allow copyright holders to invite transformation of<br />
their works - even for money - while preventing this sort of verbatim<br />
bootlegging."</p>
<p>Negativland is Creative Commons' first Project Lead, a role central to<br />
the organization's new community development model. As Creative Commons<br />
identifies new projects, Project Leads will drive public discussion from<br />
the Creative Commons website. </p>
<p>"Creative Commons is a public laboratory for new ideas," said Lawrence<br />
Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford.<br />
"By having real-life practitioners like Negativland lead volunteer<br />
discussion groups, we've come up with a nice way to build on the great<br />
ideas among our supporters."</p>
<p>Creative Commons will soon announce new Project Leads for an Education<br />
License, a Developing Nations License, and others. The nonprofit plans to<br />
extend the Project Leads model into technological developments as well. </p>
<p>More about Creative Commons</p>
<p>A nonprofit corporation, Creative Commons promotes the creative re-use of<br />
intellectual works - whether owned or public domain. It is sustained by<br />
the generous support of The Center for the Public Domain and the John D.<br />
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Creative Commons is based at<br />
Stanford Law School, where it shares staff, space, and inspiration with<br />
the school's Center for Internet and Society. </p>

<p>About Negativland</p>
<p>The experimental music and art collective known as Negativland has been<br />
recording music/audio/collage works since 1979, producing a weekly 3-hour<br />
radio show ("Over The Edge") since 1981, hosting a World Wide Web site<br />
since 1995, and performing live on occasional tours throughout America<br />
and Europe. They have released 15 CDs, one video and one book (Fair Use:<br />
The Story Of The Letter U And The Numeral 2) since 1980.</p>
<p>Negativland's particular musical practice incorporates found sounds and<br />
musical samples into their collage compositions. This contemporary<br />
interest in collage (a hallmark of 20th Century art of all kinds) stems<br />
in part from fact that art and commerce have now merged to a degree where<br />
corporations finance, groom, direct, filter, manufacture and distribute<br />
almost everything we know of as "culture." This inevitably uncomfortable<br />
partnership of art and commerce to produce "mass culture" means that art<br />
is no longer an independent creation. It is now instigated, owned,<br />
operated, and promoted by administrators, subsumed by demographic<br />
targeting, and subjected to economically inspired "guidelines" for<br />
creation.</p>
