<p>The Economist magazine September 17-23 edition has a very positive article on <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a>, <a href="http://economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=S%27%28X%20%2ARQ%3B%2A%21%20%224%0A&tranMode=none">Hear no evil</a> (subscription required).</p>
<blockquote><p>Magnatune has exceeded Mr Buckman's expectations in music licensing, another side of the business that has played a big part in helping it reach profitability. For non-commercial use, such as a school project, the site allows music to be used under a "Creative Commons" license, a concept devised by Lawrence Lessig, a law professor and crusader for internet freedom. For commercial use, Magnatune makes licenses available quickly and cheaply online. This business is growing at 30%, as Magnatune has become popular with independent filmmakers looking for soundtracks.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article also contains a key challenge and opportunity for Magnatune, Creative Commons, and the Internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Magnatune's weakness is that it does not have the resources to propel its artists into the mainstream via radio and television.<br />
<br />...<br />
<br />It will only take one rock star born on the internet, after all, for everyone to pronounce the old model completely dead.</p></blockquote>
