<p>Web Developers and designers looking for that perfect color might want to check out Eric Meyer's <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/">Color Blender</a>, recently released under a Creative Commons license. You input two colors and specify how many midtones you'll need, and it does the rest. Since it's written entirely in javascript, you can download it and use it yourself.</p>
