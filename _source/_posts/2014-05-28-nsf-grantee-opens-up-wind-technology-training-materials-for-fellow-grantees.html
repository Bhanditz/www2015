<p><a href="http://www.windtechtv.org/">WindTech TV</a>, a collection of wind turbine technician training materials and simulation modules, is now available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY license</a>. Developed as part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education project, WindTech TVâ€™s modules are aligned with industry standards and designed to be integrated into two-year college wind technology programs to sustain workforce development in the field of wind power.</p>
<p>Modules are currently being used by community colleges across the United States, and Principal Investigator Phil Pilcher wants to expand that impact through reuse by other grantees, including those part of the U.S. Department of Labor's $2 billion <a href="http://open4us.org/">Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College & Career Training (TAACCCT) grant program</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"WindTechTV has always been free, but we think that the CC BY license will increase usage. One of our project goals is to disseminate the materials nationwide. The CC license lets instructors and administrators know that they can use our videos as they wish when they are developing and delivering courses. Also, TAACCCT grantees who are working on alternative energy courses will now be able to reuse our video content, which should speed up development."</p></blockquote>
<p>All modules are available at <a href="http://www.windtechtv.org">http://www.windtechtv.org</a> and videos are available from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WindTechTv">WindTech TV's YouTube channel</a>.</p>
