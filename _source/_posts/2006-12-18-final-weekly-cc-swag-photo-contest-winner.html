<p>Today marks the last weekly winner for the first ever CC Swag Photo Contest. We have been encouraged and excited by everyone's participation.</p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monana7/324669784/"><img width="240" height="180" align="left" alt="CC on Light" src="img/324669784_9ead16a515_m.jpg" /></a>This weeks winner is  yamabobobo, with the photo titled <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monana7/324669784/in/pool-ccswagcontest06/">"CC on Light"</a>. We at CC think this photo is visually and conceptually captivating.</p>
<p>This photo ends the weekly winners series and now we are faced with choosing the two overall contest winners. Due to the holidays and the weight of the decision at hand, we will be postponing the announcement till January 2, 2007. We will start the new year fresh with new imagery to help us promote both CC and the greater mission of a participatory culture - so stay tuned!</p>
