<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/education"><img src="img/cc-edu.png" style="padding:10px;float:right;border:none" /></a>Today we launched two important resources for anyone interested in Creative Commons and education.</p>
<p>First, there's an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">education landing page</a> prominently linked from our home page. Its goal is to quickly introduce our site visitors to the vast number and range of Open Educational Resources (OER) available for use as well as the role of Creative Commons licenses in enabling OER to reach its potential. We'll be testing various iterations of this page in the coming months as well as add further assets (e.g., video) to make it an effective introduction to OER for the general public.</p>
<p>The landing page also features a number of links for anyone who wants to learn more about OER & CC and/or wants to contribute their own knowledge. Most of those links point to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER">OER Portal/Project on our wiki</a>. Our goal for this section is for our community to add useful information about OER as well as help curate this information. Ultimately, we hope processes for curating such information (e.g., a rating system for OER <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_studies">case studies</a>) will develop, looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikipedia WikiProjects</a> as an inspiration. Please dive in and help, from small corrective edits to designing and documenting curation processes.</p>
<p>These new resources are in-line with the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20329">education plans</a> we posted about at the end of January. Watch here for more!</p>
