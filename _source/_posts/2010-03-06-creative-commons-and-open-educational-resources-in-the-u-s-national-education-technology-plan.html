<p>The United States Department of Education <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/os/technology/netp.pdf">2010 National Educational Technology Plan</a> (pdf) includes the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are an important element of an infrastructure for learning. OER come in forms ranging from podcasts to digital libraries to textbooks, games, and courses. They are freely available to anyone over the web.</p>
<p>Educational organizations started making selected educational materials freely available shortly after the appearance of the web in the mid-1900s. But MITâ€™s decision to launch the OpenCourseWare (OCW) initiative to make the core content from all its courses available online in 2000 gave the OER movement a credible start (Smith, 2009). Other universities joined the OCW Consortium, and today there are more than 200 members, each of which has agreed to make at least 10 courses available in open form.</p>
<p>Many of these materials are available not just to individuals enrolled in courses, but to anyone who wants to use them. The power of OER is demonstrated by the fact that nearly half the downloads of MITâ€™s OpenCourseWare are by individual self-directed learners, not students taking courses for credit (Maxwell, online presentation for the NETP Technical Working Group, 2009).</p>
<p>Equally important to the OER movement was the emergence of the Creative Commons, an organization that developed a set of easy-to-use licenses whereby individuals or institutions could maintain ownership of their creative products while giving others selected rights. These rights range from allowing use of a work in its existing form for noncommercial purposes to the right to repurpose, remix, and redistribute for any purpose.</p>
<p>Additional advances in our understanding of how to design good OER are coming out of the work of the Open Learning Initiative (OLI) at Carnegie Mellon University. OLI has been developing state-of-the-art, high-quality online learning environments that are implemented as part of courses taught not only at Carnegie Mellon, but also at other universities and at community colleges. The OLI learning systems are submitted to rigorous ongoing evaluation and refinement as part of each implementation. (For more information on OLI, see the Assessment section of this plan.)</p>
<p>The Department of Education has a role in stimulating the development and use of OER in ways that address pressing education issues. The federal government has proposed to invest $50 million per year for the next 10 years in creating an Online Skills Lab to develop exemplary next-generation instructional tools and resources for community colleges and workforce development programs. These materials will be available for use or adaptation with the least restrictive Creative Commons license. This work is expected to give further impetus to calls for open standards, system utilities, and competency-based assessments. (For more information on the Online Skills Lab, see the Learning section of this plan.)</p>
<p>The OER movement begun in higher education should be more fully adopted throughout our K-16 public education system. For example, high-quality digital textbooks for standard courses such as algebra can be created by experts and funded by consortia arrangements and then made freely available as a public good. Open textbooks could significantly reduce the cost of education in primary and secondary as well as higher education. Textbooks constitute a significant portion of the governmentâ€™s K-12 budget as well as the student-borne cost of higher education.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also see the plan's sidebar on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20367">California Free Digital Textbook Initiative</a>, the first phase of which has been dominated (15 of 16) by CC licensed textbooks.</p>
<p>The plan also directly demonstrates effective reuse -- it includes and properly attributes two CC-licensed illustrations.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the U.S. Department of Education and the OER movement!</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> See open education pioneer <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/1279">David Wiley's reaction</a> to a speech by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan given the day before the National Education Technology Plan's publication. Wiley highlights OER's role as infrastructure for education innovation. Those aren't just buzzwords -- <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/1279">read Wiley's post</a>.</p>
