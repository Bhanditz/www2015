<p><a href="http://jamendo.com">Jamendo</a>, a music site with over 10,000 CC-licensed albums, has <a href="http://blog.jamendo.com/2008/07/25/mp3tunes-and-jamendo-team-up-to-offer-free-music-for-free-lockers/">teamed up with MP3tunes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Give it a try at <a href="http://www.mp3tunes.com/jamendo" target="_blank">www.mp3tunes.com/jamendo</a> - youâ€™ll find 10 exclusive playlists of the best in rock, hip hop, jazz and more from Jamendo. Sign up for a Music Locker - itâ€™s free to try - and then with a single click get each playlist you like added to your to your collection. You can also add personal music from your computer in your Locker with free, easy-to-use software.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is very cool. Heavily curated playlists are one way to address the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8328">discovery problem</a>. Using freely licensed music is how <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8496">internet music startups can get the economics of all other internet startups</a>. Unsaid in the announcement linked above, all of the playlisted tracks in the Jamendo/MP3tunes collaboration are licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, allowing commercial use and recalling a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8496">recently posted quote from Lucas Gonze</a> on commercial use and "empowering businesses to build support systems for your music."</p>
