<p>On Thursday, March 14 <a href="http://karisma.org.co/">FundaciÃ³n Karisma</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/es/office-in-montevideo/home/">UNESCO</a> and Creative Commons will launch the report <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/ai1ec_event/lanzamiento-del-informe-unesco-gasto-publico-en-la-educacion-de-america-latina-puede-servir-a-los-propositos-de-la-declaracion-de-paris-sobre-recursos-educativos-abiertos-2/?instance_id=39">â€œPublic Expenditure On Education in Latin America: Can It Serve the Paris Open Educational Resources Declarationâ€™s Purposes?â€</a></p>
<p><a href="http://karisma.org.co/?p=3346">â€œHuman rights are not left at the door when we enter the online world.â€</a> This is the premise on which we embark on a new research project related to one of the fundamental rights <a href="http://redpatodos.co/internetlibre/">under threat</a> in a networked society: access to knowledge.</p>
<p>In Latin America, paper textbooks coexist with digital technologies, but for the most part these digital resources are not yet an essential part of education systems. Despite efforts to foster the pedagogical use of information technology, in Latin America there is currently more emphasis on connectivity issues. Without adequately addressing the challenges to connectivity, the educational ecosystem is wasting real opportunities to boost the adoption and implementation of appropriate technologies.</p>
<p>Open education promotes knowledge as a public good based on the following elements: redistribution (sharing with others), remixing (combining resources to create new content), free reuse of whole or partial educational materials with proper attribution, the ability to revise resources in order to make modifications, enhancements, and adaptations according to context, and peer reviewing to ensure resource quality.</p>
<p>As described in the report, the increasing availability of Open Educational Resources open up a range of possibilities for the countries of the region that are still depending on a high level of negotiations between state educational systems and the publishing industry. But while many governments do not have the technological capabilities to facilitate the realization of human rights, the recommendations of important instruments such as the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/Events/Paris%20OER%20Declaration_01.pdf">Paris Open Educational Resources (OER) Declaration</a> can be a useful tool to prompt political and social change within the educational systems in Latin America. According to the Paris OER Declaration, Open Educational Resources include any teaching, learning and research materials which are in the public domain or released under an intellectual property license that allows for free use, adaptation and distribution.</p>
<p>The report was commissioned by the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/es/office-in-montevideo/home/">UNESCO Regional Bureau for Science in Latin America and the Caribbean</a>. It will be released on Thursday and published under a Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">BY-NC-ND</a> license. The report seeks to identify and analyze public policy and the investment and expenditure that the governments of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay have committed for the development and procurement of textbooks, books and digital content for primary and secondary education (K-12).</p>
<p>Because the purpose of <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/">Open Education Week</a> is to raise awareness about the movement and its impact on teaching and learning worldwide, we invite you to be part of the <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/ai1ec_event/lanzamiento-del-informe-unesco-gasto-publico-en-la-educacion-de-america-latina-puede-servir-a-los-propositos-de-la-declaracion-de-paris-sobre-recursos-educativos-abiertos-2/?instance_id=39">webinar</a>. The event will be a dialogue on open education issues in the region with the participation of Carolina Rossini, OER expert from Brazil, Juan Carlos Bernal from the Ministry of National Education of Colombia, and Patricia Diaz and Virgina Rodes, who are members of the Uruguayan OER community. In addition to these speakers, a Creative Commons and UNESCO representatives will join the talk, as well as the group of researchers from FundaciÃ³n Karisma who developed the report.</p>
