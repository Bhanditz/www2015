<p>A couple weeks ago, we mentioned <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4287">Flickr added support for Creative Commons licenses</a> to their photo uploading and hosting service. This week, they've announced a pretty amibitious new feature: <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2004/07/turn_any_blog_i.html">mobile phone blogging for almost any blog service</a>.</p>
<p>It works like this: you setup an account at Flickr, enable moble blogging features by inputing details about your blog, choose a CC license, and you'll be able to post photos from your phone to any Blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type, and/or Typepad powered weblog. <a href="http://kathrynyu.com/">Here's a great example blog</a> of CC-licensed photos being posted through Flickr.</p>
<p>I'm really impressed with this new feature. I've built my own similar system and it required <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/006737">a weekend of hacking and data spread across three servers</a>. Now anyone can have a similar setup by simply using the free Flickr service in just a few minutes.</p>
