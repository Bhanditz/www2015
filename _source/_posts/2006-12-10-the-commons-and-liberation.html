<p>Eben Moglen's Plone Conference keynote address <em><a href="http://plone.org/events/conferences/seattle-2006/agenda/watch-eben-moglen-s-plone-conference-keynote-address">Software and Community in the Early 21st century</a></em> places <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6158">free software</a> in the context of historical desire for freedom and social justice, closing with "The difference is, this time, we win."</p>
<p>While Moglen's focus is free software, everything he says applies equally to free culture. He uses the first audience question (at about 56:20, concerning user generated content) to address Creative Commons and free culture, for which he has he has an upbeat prognosis.</p>
<p>Video of the talk is available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NorfgQlEJv8">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/eben-moglen-oct-2006">Archive.org</a> under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.orrg/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license. <a href="http://www.geof.net/blog/2006/12/10/eben-moglen">Geof Glass has produced a transcript</a> of the main part of the talk, under (of course) the same license.</p>
<p>A pity that the talk does not currently seem to be available in a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6157">free format</a>.<sup>*</sup> About four months ago I mentioned another excellent talk by Moglen also featuring Lawrence Lessig in Q&A on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6019">the ethics and future of the free culture movement</a>, which is available in free formats.</p>
<p><small><sup>*</sup> Apologies, I must take the opportunity to be the one complaining about free format availability, having previously been in the position of making excuses for not providing the same.</small></p>
