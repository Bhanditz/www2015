<p>Yochai Benkler has published his new book, <a href="http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Main_Page"><em>The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom</em></a> under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5</a> license. A brief excerpt (page 482):</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e are seeing an ever-more<br />
self-conscious adoption of commons-based practices as a modality of infor-<br />
mation production and exchange. Free software, Creative Commons, the<br />
Public Library of Science, the new guidelines of the National Institutes of<br />
Health (NIH) on free publication of papers, new open archiving practices,<br />
librarian movements, and many other communities of practice are devel-<br />
oping what was a contingent fact into a self-conscious social movement. As<br />
the domain of existing information and culture comes to be occupied by<br />
information and knowledge produced within these free sharing movements<br />
and licensed on the model of open-licensing techniques, the problem of the<br />
conï¬‚ict with the proprietary domain will recede. Twentieth-century materials<br />
will continue to be a point of friction, but a sufï¬cient quotient of twenty-<br />
ï¬rst-century materials seem now to be increasingly available from sources<br />
that are happy to share them with future users and creators. If this social-<br />
cultural trend continues over time, access to content resources will present<br />
an ever-lower barrier to nonmarket production.</p></blockquote>
