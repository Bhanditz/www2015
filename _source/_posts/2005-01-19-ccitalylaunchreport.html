<p>Juan Carlos De Martin writes in with a report on last month's Creative Commons Italy launch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Italian CC Licenses were launched in Turin on December 16th, with a<br />
conference at the<br />
<a href="http://www.fga.it/">Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli</a>. Over 100<br />
people crowded the attractive conference room of the<br />
Fondazione, with several journalists in attendance to cover the event.</p>
<p>The first part of the program prepared by the iCommons Italy Affiliate<br />
Institutions (<a href="http://www.dsg.unito.it/">University of Turin<br />
Law School</a> and <a href="http://www.ieiit.cnr.it">IEIIT-CNR</a>)<br />
coordinated by the Italian project lead, prof. Marco Ricolfi, consisted<br />
of<br />
presentations by Lawrence Lessig, who eloquently explained the<br />
conceptual foundations of CC,<br />
and by Christiane Asschenfeldt, who reported on the state of the art of<br />
the iCommons project.</p>
<p>Marco Ricolfi then spoke about the process that produced<br />
the Italian CC licenses, highlighting among the other things that like<br />
elsewhere in Europe there is a need<br />
for some adjustments to the role of collecting societies to second the<br />
growing desire of authors to<br />
distribute their works more freely. Juan Carlos De Martin, a computer<br />
engineering researcher with IEIIT-CNR,<br />
provided an overview of the CC technical challenges and stressed the<br />
role of technology in<br />
enabling the 'Some Rights Reserved' vision in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Talks that followed the lively discussion session were a selection<br />
of the many proposals<br />
submitted in response to a call made by the organizers back in October<br />
2004.</p>
<p>The presentations touched a wide range of topics, including the<br />
relationship between free software<br />
and CC licenses (Alessandro Rubini), Radiodrome - a student web radio<br />
experiment at the Politecnico di Torino<br />
(Puria Nafisi and Jovi Berton), and a report on work in progress on CC<br />
in a country next door to Italy,<br />
Slovenia (Maja Bogataj Jan&ccedil;i&ccedil;). The conference ended with<br />
the words of an artist from another<br />
neighboring country, France: Dominique, lead singer of the free rock<br />
group <a href="http://godon.org/">Godon</a>, explained<br />
why Godon chose CC licenses to release their music on their web site.<br />
For a complete list of all the talks, see the <a href="http://creativecommons.ieiit.cnr.it/ccit2004/">site of the event</a>,<br />
where most presentations (in English) will be available shortly.</p>
<p>The event was webcast live by IEIIT-CNR, using its free streaming<br />
software,<br />
the <a href="http://streaming.polito.it">Open Media Streaming project</a>,<br />
which supports handling of CCPL licensing metadata.</p>
<p>After the conference, attendees were invited to move to the near-by<br />
Imbarco Perosino,<br />
an attractive venue right on the backs of the Po river, for a<br />
celebratory "aperitivo",<br />
followed by a "Creative Christmas" party that lasted into the night.</p>
