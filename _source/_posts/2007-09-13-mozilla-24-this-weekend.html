<p>No matter where you are in the world, you should check out the <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/">Mozilla 24 Conference</a> this weekend. This worldwide community event will begin at 8pm PDT. The conference will be physically held in <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/programs/tokyo/">Tokyo</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/programs/paris/">Paris</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/programs/thailand/">Thailand</a>, and the <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/programs/stanford/">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. However, you can tune in to watch via the broadband video WIDE network. Mozilla has also made it possible to pose questions to the speakers and interact with the other online participants via IRC. If you're interested in hearing about the future of the web from some of the top leaders in the field you should check out all the <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/online/">details</a>.</p>
