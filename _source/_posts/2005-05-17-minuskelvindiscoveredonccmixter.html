<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org/by/minuskelvin">Minus Kelvin</a>, a physics and calculus teacher by day and composer by night, has been making regular contributions to <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> since February.</p>
<p>
Friday we learned that <a href="http://www.runoffrecordsinc.com/home.htm">Runoff Records, Inc.</a> has signed MinusKelvin, after discovering his music through a podcast of ccMixter (enabled by the licenses). Together with another ccMixter contributor, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/by/beatgorilla">Pat Chilla</a>, they will now be doing music for the next three seasons of <a href="http://www.upn.com/shows/top_model2/">America's Next Top Model</a>. </p>
