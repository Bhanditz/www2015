<p style="padding-left: 30px">"Weâ€™re happy to announce that weâ€™re launching the public comment and discussion period for our new patent tools: the Research Non-Assertion Pledge and the Public Patent License. We invite you to join the discussion at our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Patent_Tools_Public_Discussion">public wiki</a>. There you can read about these tools, catch up on hot topics of interest to the community, or join our public discussion list to contribute your thoughts and suggestions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">These tools were conceived as part of our collaboration with <a href="http://greenxchange.force.com/">The GreenXchange (GX)</a>, a network of companies interested in making publicly available unpatented know-how and patented inventions that have the potential to promote innovation, sustainability, resource management, and other socially responsible uses of ideas and inventions. The Research Non-Assertion Pledge and Public Patent License are just pieces of the underlying infrastructure for how to share and transform that kind of knowledgeâ€”just like CC licenses have become part of the infrastructure for exchanging and transforming creative works. While these tools were initially conceived in collaboration with GX, we envision them as generic tools maintained by CC for anyone to use, and we hope they will prove to be useful in other projects in the future as well. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to us to get comprehensive comments and feedback from the community and the public. <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2010/04/02/launching-public-discussion-of-cc-patent-tools/">[...]</a>"</p>
