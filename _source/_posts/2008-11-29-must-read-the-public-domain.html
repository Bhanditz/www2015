<div style="float:right; width:200px; padding:10px"><a href="http://thepublicdomain.org"><img src="img/james-boyle-the-public-domain-smallcover.jpg" title="the public domain" /></a><br /><small><em>The Public Domain</em> cover, evolved from excellent <a href="http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2008/11/06/cover/">contest entries</a>. We blogged about the contest <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8189">in April</a>.</small></div>
<p><em>The Public Domain</em> covers the history, theory, and future of the public domain, taking a broad conception of the meaning and import of the public domain:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>When the subject is intellectual property, this gap in our knowledge turns out to be important because our intellectual property system depends on a balance between what is property and what is not. For a set of reasons that I will explain later, â€œthe opposite of propertyâ€ is a concept that is much more important when we come to the world of ideas, information, expression, and invention. We want a lot of material to be in the public domain, material that can be spread without property rights. â€œThe general rule of law is, that the noblest of human productionsâ€”knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions, and ideasâ€”become, after voluntary communication to others, free as the air to common use.â€ Our art, our culture, our science depend on this public domain every bit as much as they depend on intellectual property. The third goal of this book is to explore propertyâ€™s outside, propertyâ€™s various antonyms, and to show how we are undervaluing the public domain and the information commons at the very moment in history when we need them most. Academic articles and clever legal briefs cannot solve this problem alone.</p>
<p>Instead, I argue that precisely because we are in the information age, we need a movementâ€”akin to the environmental movementâ€”to preserve the public domain. The explosion of industrial technologies that threatened the environment also taught us to recognize its value. The explosion of information technologies has precipitated an intellectual land grab; it must also teach us about both the existence and the value of the public domain. This enlightenment does not happen by itself. The environmentalists helped us to see the world differently, to see that there was such a thing as â€œthe environmentâ€ rather than just my pond, your forest, his canal. We need to do the same thing in the information environment.</p>
<p>We have to â€œinventâ€ the public domain before we can save it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's from the <a href="http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/17">preface</a>. I encourage you to read on, to chapters about <a href="http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/169">Creative Commons</a> (of course), <a href="http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/182">evidence-based policy and the public domain</a> (my favorite), a <a href="http://yupnet.org/boyle/archives/189">movement for the public domain</a>, and much history, theory, and wit leading up to those.</p>
<p>You can also read and subscribe to <a href="http://www.thepublicdomain.org/blog/">Boyle's blog on <em>The Public Domain</em></a>, which includes an excellent post on <a href="http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2008/11/28/questions-from-authors/">authors, academic presses, online publishing and CC licensing</a>. Brief excerpt, emphasis added to the truth that will be so obvious to readers of this blog that one might wonder why it would need to be said:<br />
<blockquote>The one piece of advice I would offer is to make sure that you really talk it through with everyone at the press and <b>get them to understand the way the web works</b>.  While university presses might want to experiment only with a few titles, when it comes to those titles they need fully to embrace the idea â€” creating an excellent website for the book (or allowing the author to do so), allowing multiple formats of the book to be made available (pdf, html etc), being excited rather than horrified if the book gets mentioned on a blog and downloads spike.  The last thing you want is a publisher who has grudgingly agreed to a Creative Commons license but who then sabotages every attempt to harness the openness it allows.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately how the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7779">web</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7240">works</a> and what that means for copyright and publishing still needs to be explained. Repeatedly. Every day. That's one reason <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">Creative Commons needs your support to meet our $500,000 annual public campaign goal</a>. Every day we explain how the web works, how to work with the web, and how to keep the web open, for <a href="http://sciencecommons.org" title="Making the Web Work for Science">scientists</a>, <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org" title="dedicated to realizing the full potential of the internet to support open learning and open educational resources">educators and learners</a>, and everyone else. And we do our bit to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10095">improve the open web</a>.</p>
