<p>Just one week after the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8396">big release</a> of the <strong><a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/Casestudies">Case Studies</a></strong> project, things are doing great!Â  The project has garnered a lot of attention as can be seen from this <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/index.php?title=Special:Ask&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=20&amp;q=[[Category%3APress+Hit]]%0A[[Date%3A%3A%3E2008%2F06%2F24]]&amp;p=format%3Dbroadtable&amp;po=%3FPublication%0A%3FDate%0A&amp;order=ASC">example list</a>. Some of the things said about the project include these two excerpts.</p>
<p>Ruth Suehle from <a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2008/06/25/whos-using-creative-commons-now-you-can-find-out/">Red Hat Magazine</a> said:<a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2008/06/25/whos-using-creative-commons-now-you-can-find-out/"><br />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Despite having just launched, the site is already full of studies.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Marshall Kirkpatrick from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/does_creative_commons_work_database.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> echos the sentiment with:</p>
<blockquote><p>If your organization is interested in making your content easier to distribute, this database is a great place to learn from the experiences of others. ... The breadth of examples already available is very commendable and many of them are quite well developed.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of the support and positive reviews of the projects are great, but what is really showing us how much this project is appreciated is the fact that people are adding and editing Case Studies!Â  If you haven't found your favorite photographer, filmmaker, musician, or writer who uses CC licenses on <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:Ask/-5B-5BCategory:Casestudy-5D-5D/%3FAuthor/%3FFormat/%3FCountry/sort%3D/order%3DASC">the list</a></strong>, take a moment and add them.</p>
<p>We have also started to put together some Professions pages to be used to help people find examples of case studies and other information for their discipline more easily.Â  Right now the pages include a featured list of case studies per profession and even some links to notable works in those areas.Â  There is a page for <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Photographer">Photographers</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Musician">Musicians</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Writer">Writers</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Filmmaker">Filmmakers</a></strong>. Be sure to check them out.</p>
<p>And, like any other part of this project, if you find anything missing, incorrect, or out of date, feel free to change it.Â  If you have any suggestions as to what can be added feel free to mention that as well.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for making this project so successful!</p>
