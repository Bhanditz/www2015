This time around, the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/San_Francisco_Salon">SF Salon's</a> theme will focus on Creative Commons in the realm of film and media. We've got an all-star line-up of inspiring folks who will be talking about how CC and open and shared culture are all vital and exciting components of the media world. The night will start off with Jolene Pinder, an Associate Producer at <a href="http://www.artsengine.net/index.php"> Arts Engine, Inc.</a> in NYC. Jolene will be screening a short CC-licensed film and talking about the various ways in which Arts Engine uses CC licenses. Next, CC's very own Creative Director, Eric Steuer, will be talking about the soon to be launched film maker's toolkit.  And last but not least, Robin Sloan, Product Strategist from <a href="http://current.com/">Current TV</a> will wrap up the evening.</p>
<p> Mark your calendars for Wednesday, August 13, from 7-9pm.<br />
The event will be held at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=1337+Mission+St,+San+Francisco,+CA&amp;ll=37.77638,-122.415161&amp;spn=0.014789,0.042787">Shine Bar</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p> We hope you will join us for what is sure to be an entertaining and memorable CC Salon!</p>
