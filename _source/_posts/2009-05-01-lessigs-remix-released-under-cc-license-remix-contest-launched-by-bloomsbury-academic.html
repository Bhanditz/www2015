Starting today, the entire book is available for free download under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC license</a> from Bloomsbury Academic's <a href="http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/remix.htm">website</a>.</p>
<p>We are incredibly excited that a text devoted to the art and value of remixing is being released under a license that allows free and open sharing and reuse - it turns out we aren't the only ones. To celebrate the launch, Bloomsburry is holding a contest titled <em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/London-United-Kingdom/Bloomsbury-Academic/63101861581?ref=ts#/event.php?eid=71191382717&ref=mf">Remix the Remixer</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To celebrate the Creative Commons release of Lawrence Lessigâ€™s latest book, Remix, Bloomsbury Academic are hosting a competition you have the chance to win an original remixed item created by Cory Doctorow on the 1st of May (with a video of the event), Â£200 (about 300 USD) worth of Bloomsbury books and a copy of Remix signed by Lessig himself.</p>
<p>The competition is called Remix the Remixer. Just remix any of Lawrence Lessigâ€™s existing work and create something that is new, unique and creative.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s how it works: Find any video, interview, or written work of Lessigâ€™s, mash it up with another piece of Lessigâ€™s work and create something new. It can be a video (3 min max), photo (nothing offensive, please) or text.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Be sure to upload your remixes between now (May 1) and May 31 to be considered for the prize drawings.</p>
