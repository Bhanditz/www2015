<p>Creative Commons and Science Commons Announce Open Access Law Program</p>
<p>San Francisco & Boston, USA â€” June 6, 2005</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible<br />
 copyright licenses for authors and artists, and Science Commons, a<br />
 project of Creative Commons that works to encourage sharing of<br />
 scientific and academic knowledge, today unveiled their Open Access<br />
 Law Program. The Program is designed to make legal scholarship<br />
 â€œopen access,â€ that is freely available online to everyone,<br />
 without undue copyright and licensing restrictions. The Open Access<br />
 Law Program is an initiative of the Science Commons Publishing<br />
 Project, which seeks to reduce the legal and logistical effort<br />
 involved in managing copyrighted scholarly publications.</p>
<p>As part of their Open Access Law Program, Creative Commons and<br />
 Science Commons are working with a large number of law journals to<br />
 encourage the open access archiving of the articles that they<br />
 publish. Science Commons has created a set of resources to promote<br />
 open access in legal publishing, including its Open Access Law<br />
 Journal Principles and an Open Access Law Model Publication<br />
 Agreement. The Principles and the Agreement encourage open access<br />
 to legal scholarship, by encouraging law journals to post their<br />
 published articles to the Internet, or allowing authors to do so.<br />
 They protect the basic interests of both journal and author by<br />
 ensuring that the journal is given a license to use the work, and<br />
 is always attributed as the place of first publication. Law<br />
 journals can adopt the Open Access Principles or can develop their<br />
 own policies consistent with the Principles. Journals can also<br />
 adopt the Science Commons Open Access Law Model Publication<br />
 Agreement as their standard agreement with all authors. Both<br />
 documents are available at <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/oalaw/">the Science Commonsâ€™ Open Access Law<br />
 webpage</a></p>
<p>Staff at Science Commonsâ€™ offices in Boston worked with program<br />
 leads Professor Dan Hunter of the Wharton School, University of<br />
 Pennsylvania and Professor Mike Carroll of Villanova Law School,<br />
 who serves on the Board of Creative Commons, to produce the<br />
 Principles and the Agreement.</p>
<p>Professor Hunter said â€œOpen access to law articles is an idea<br />
 whose time has come. All of the players in US scholarly legal<br />
 journal publishing have an interest in the widest possible audience<br />
 for their material. The authors benefit, the journals benefit, and<br />
 law schools benefit. And more importantly, the public benefits.<br />
 Everyone walks away a winner.â€</p>
<p>Already 21 law reviews have adopted the Open Access Principles, or<br />
 have policies that are consistent with them. Leading journals such<br />
 as Animal Law, Harvard Journal of Law & Technology, Indiana Law<br />
 Journal, Lewis & Clark Law Review, Michigan Law Review, Michigan<br />
 State Law Review, New York Law School Law Review, Texas Law Review,<br />
 Vanderbilt Law Review, and Wayne Law Review have signed on, as have<br />
 all of the journals published by Duke Law School and Villanova Law<br />
 School.</p>
<p>Heidi Bond, the Executive Articles Editor of the Michigan Law<br />
 Review, one of the first journals to have policies consistent with<br />
 the Principles, said â€œLaw reviews do not need to demand ownership<br />
 of their author's manuscripts. We think our publication policies<br />
 should contribute to the free exchange of ideas among legal<br />
 academics. Open access policies make for happier authors and better<br />
 scholarship. After all, law review articles are like software:<br />
 they're best when they're free for others to learn from and build<br />
 on.â€</p>
<p>Creative Commons became involved in supporting open access to law<br />
 scholarship through Professor Lawrence Lessig, Stanford Law<br />
 professor and Chair of Creative Commons. In March this year he<br />
 signed away his copyright in an article to a law review and vowed<br />
 never to do it again. He has since thrown his weight behind efforts<br />
 to make legal scholarship open to all. Professor Lessig said â€œWhen<br />
 I drew my line in the sand, I knew of only one journal that was<br />
 open access. Today there are at least 21. Iâ€™m not sure that more<br />
 law review articles by me is a benefit to society, but at least<br />
 there are journals where I can publish and know that everyone can<br />
 read my work online, for free.â€</p>
<p>Professor Lessig is the first signatory on the Open Access Law<br />
 Author Pledge, where law professors can agree to support open<br />
 access principles. This support includes encouraging journals to<br />
 become open access and promising to publish only in journals that<br />
 are open access.</p>
<p>Through its Open Access Law Program, Science Commons will work with<br />
 law schools, authors, libraries and journals to encourage open<br />
 access to legal journals and articles, and plans to expand the<br />
 Program into other areas of law publishing. Although the programâ€™s<br />
 initial focus is on legal publishing in the United States, Science<br />
 Commons is also supporting international efforts to make legal<br />
 material freely available to all.</p>
