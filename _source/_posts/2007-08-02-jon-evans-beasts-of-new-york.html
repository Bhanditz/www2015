<p><a href="http://www.rezendi.com/">Jon Evans</a>, author of the <a href="http://www.crimewriterscanada.com/">Arthur Ellis Award</a> winning novel <em>Dark Places</em> (<em>Trail Of The Dead </em>in the UK), is serializing his latest novel, <em><a href="http://www.beastsofnewyork.com/">Beasts of New York</a></em>, online under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND licence</a>.</p>
<p>Described by Evans as a "children's book for adults", <em>Beasts of New York</em> represents a shift for Evans, who is known for international thrillers, in terms of content and style:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's an urban fantasy about the wildlife of New York City, starring a squirrel protagonist who has to find his way from exile in Staten Island back to his home in Central Park</p></blockquote>
<p>Evans will be posting a chapter a day - he is currently on the 17th - ultimately publishing 60 chapters, or 2 months worth of content. In his <a href="http://www.beastsofnewyork.com/faq.html">FAQ</a> (which is a must read), Evans gives ample insight into why he chose to use a CC-license for <em>Beasts of New York</em>, citing the success of authors such as <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> and others who have successfully implemented CC-licensing for their online publishing while maintaining commercial viability in print-form.</p>
<p>Essentially, Evans wanted to write and release a novel his publishers found unmarketable. As he puts it, "try to imagine telling people with a financial interest in your writing success that you want to write a whole book about a squirrel". Evans saw CC-licences and online publishing as a means to allow his work be read freely, while at the same time retaining potential commercial avenues for the book (Evans "cautiously expect[s] [<em>Beasts of New York</em>] to eventually find a publisher").  This is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7571">yet</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7564">another</a> phenomenal example of the power of CC-licences in a <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2006/09/on_the_economies_of_culture.html">hybrid economy</a>.</p>
