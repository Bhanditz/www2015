<p><a href="http://www.miraverse.com/">The Miraverse</a> is going to double the next $5000 given to Creative Commons! Starting right now, if you donate anything between $5 and $500 to CC, the Miraverse will match every dollar you give. The Miraverse believes no amount is too small and that <em>everyone</em> should give back to Creative Commons, so whatever amount you give to CC right now, your impact will be automatically doubled. <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">Donate quick</a> to make sure your gift gets doubled!</p>
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/" class="aligncenter"><img src="img/donate-8.png" alt="" title="donate-8" width="172" height="43" class="size-full wp-image-24163" /></a></p>
<p>Here's why the Miraverse supports CC:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Miraverse is an environment for developing new media productions and reaching new audiences through increased participation at every level and at every step of the creative process.  Without the past work--and success--of Creative Commons, there would be no legal basis from which we could presume to proceed.  But because of their great work we can begin our venture with the confidence that millions upon millions now understand that copyright need not be the end of creativity, but a potential beginning of an infinite number of wonderful futures.  We are delighted to support an organization that has laid the foundation for us, and we accept that the best way to ensure a better future for everything we do is to support those who are doing the best work today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Join the Miraverse in <a href="https://www.creativecommons.net/donate">supporting CC</a> and have your donation automatically doubled. Can you <a href="https://www.creativecommons.net/donate">give $25, $75, or $100</a> to support the future of creativity and the work of Creative Commons? </p>
