<p>When it comes to copyright, our youth are too often bombarded with extremes. The entertainment industry giants propagate a skewed perspective by launching anti-copying educational programs, leaving out much of the balanced information necessary to cultivating user's awareness about her real rights to a resource. This results in students thinking that they can react in only one of two ways: by breaking the law in the face of overbearing restrictions, or by doing absolutely nothing at all with copyrighted works, effectively stifling the learning that comes of creatively engaging with them.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation recognized this problem and went to work on a <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/">copyright curriculum</a> that would not only be fair and balanced in perspective, but comprehensive in its scope by encouraging discussion and self-education. From the <a href="http://www.eff.org/press/archives/2009/05/27">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Kids are bombarded with messages that using new technology is illegal... Instead of approaching the issues from a position of fear, Teaching Copyright encourages inquiry and greater understanding. This is a balanced curriculum, asking students to think about their role in the online world and to make informed choices about their behavior."</p></blockquote>
<p>ccLearn has taken a look at <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/">Teaching Copyright</a> and we commend it. The curriculum is created and vetted by lawyers and promotes a balanced teaching perspective, clearing up much of the misinformation that is current industry propaganda. Like EFF Staff Attorney Corynne McSherry says, "Today's tech-savvy teens will grow into the artists and innovators of tomorrow." We need to help them "understand their digital rights and responsibilities in order to create, critique, and comment on their culture. This curriculum fills an educational void, introducing critical questions of digital citizenship into the classroom without misinformation that scares kids from expressing themselves in the modern world."</p>
<p>The entire curriculum and accompanying resources on the <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/">Teaching Copyright website</a> are licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">CC BY</a>, which appropriately encourages students, teachers, and anyone else to adapt it to various educational needs and contexts.</p>
