<p>We were quite happy to hear that today the <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/">Webby Award</a> nominations came out, and Creative Commons is up for "<a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php#best_home_page">Best Home/Welcome Page</a>."</p>
<p>We couldn't have done it without the crew at <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a> leading the user research, prototyping, and testing, while <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Doug Bowman</a> helped with the illustrations, and <a href="http://www.junell.net/">Ryan Junell</a> with the logos. I completed the design and build out and we've gotten a lot of good feedback as a result. I look forward to seeing the results in June, but my money's on one of the wiz-bang flash sites winning the webby. :)</p>
