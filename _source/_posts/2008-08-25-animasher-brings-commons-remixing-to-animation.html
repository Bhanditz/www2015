<p><a href="http://www.animasher.com/">Animasher</a> is a site with a simple premise based on a powerful tool that helps anyone remix the commons. The core of the site is a flash tool that enables easy key frame based creation of animations complete with music and narration. In order to seed the site with remixable content, Animasher pulls <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/by-2.0/">Attribution licensed photographs</a> from <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and Attribution and Public Domain music from other sources such as <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/albums?license_class=cc_standard&license_maxrights=sa&license_minrights=by+c+d">Jamendo</a> and <a href="http://opsound.org/index.php">Opsound</a>. Proper attribution is then automatically generated for each animation which is also licensed under CC-BY. All animations can be cloned and edited instantly by anyone visiting the site.</p>
<p>To get started, <a href="http://www.animasher.com/hot">watch some of the animations</a> created by other users, or <a href="http://www.animasher.com/create">create your own</a>.</p>
