<p><a href="http://www.feedster.com/">Feedster</a>, the RSS search engine, <a href="http://www.feedster.com/blog/2003/07/18.html#a1904">now understands Creative Commons licenses</a> found in feeds. This marks one of the first search engines of any sort to recognize our metadata and display information about it. They'll start implementing them on search results and cache pages soon but are open to other suggestions for use.</p>
