<p>This Sunday, October <s>12th</s> <strong>14th</strong>, I will be joining Jack Learner, Visiting Clinical Assistant Professor of Law and Acting Director at the <a href="http://law.usc.edu/academics/clinical/ip.cfm">USC Intellectual Property and Technology Law Clinic</a>, for a discussion of fair use and the arts as part of <a href="http://www.foundla.com/artcrawl/">Art Crawl X</a>. </p>
<p>It will be taking place at the <a href="http://www.foundla.com/">FoundLA Gallery</a> in Silverlake (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=1903+Hyperion+Ave.,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90027&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;ll=34.097591,-118.275719&amp;spn=0.021642,0.041542&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=addr">1903 Hyperion Ave., 90027</a>) at 4PM. The ArtWalk in general promises to be quite the cultural explosion (look at the <a href="http://www.foundla.com/artcrawl/events.shtml">events page </a>to find out more) and if you are in the area and interested in CC or Fair Use and the arts, you should definitely swing by. </p>
