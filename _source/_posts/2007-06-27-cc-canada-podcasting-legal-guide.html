<p>Creative Commons Canada has <a href="http://www.creativecommons.ca/blog/archives/2007/06/26/podcasting-legal-guide-for-canada/">just released their version</a> of the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Podcasting_Legal_Guide">Creative Commons Podcasting Legal Guide</a>, ported specifically for Canadian laws and practices. The guide was handed out this weekend in printed form at the Podcasters Across Borders conference in Kingston, Ontario and is available in PDF format on the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.ca/">CC Canada website</a>. The guide is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/">CC Canada Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> licence.</p>
<p>When it was first created, the Podcasting Legal Guide pertained specifically to the U.S., with the hope that other jurisdictions would translate and adapt the guide for their own jurisdiction in order to assist podcasters around the world. CC Canada has done just that, and you can read what one of the original PLG authors has to say about it <a href="http://www.rulesfortherevolution.com/2007/06/26/podcasting-legal-guide-for-canada/">here</a>. We hope this is the first of many adaptations to come and that other jurisdictions will be able to follow in CC Canada's footsteps.</p>
