<p>While we're talking translations:</p>
<p>As our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">iCommons</a> project begins to port the lawyer-readable licenses to various countries' laws and languages, we'd like to start translating the human-readable portion of our licenses as well. (Here's an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">example</a> of one in English.)</p>
<p>Just as humans are less formal than lawyers, so will this process be less formal than iCommons, so <a href="mailto:info@creativecommons.org">send us</a> what you've got when you've got it . . . </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
