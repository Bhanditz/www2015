<p>A class of services that complements and builds upon the CC infrastructure includes assurance, provenance, registration, and warranty.  <a href="http://numly.com">Numly</a> and <a href="http://registeredcommons.org">RegisteredCommons</a> are two currently pioneering organizations in this space.</p>
<p>Chris Matthieu of Numly started a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Registrars">descrption and comparison table for the space on the CC wiki</a>.  People from RegisteredCommons have added. Other experts or those merely interested are encouraged to contribute as well.</p>
<p>See a <a href="http://numly.com/numly/verify.asp?id=84110-061014-12440-790">Numly record</a> for Chris' original description of Numly on the CC Wiki and a <a href="http://www.registeredcommons.org/view/167/0/7880">record on RegisteredCommons</a>.</p>
<p>Both projects have or are working on search, Firefox integration, WordPress integration ... the whole Web 2.0 bag of tricks.  "Copyright 2.0" is what Chris Matthieu calls it.</p>
<p>iCommons did a <a href="http://icommons.org/2006/09/25/copy-it-right/">Q&A with RegisteredCommons</a> last month.</p>
