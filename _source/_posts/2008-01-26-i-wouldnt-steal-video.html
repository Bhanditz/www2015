<p><em><a href="http://iwouldntsteal.net">I wouldn't steal</a></em> is a new and cute one minute video making the case that sharing is fair and people who would never steal a handbag, car, or television nevertheless download film and music. Whatever you think of that, there's no ambiguity around downloading and remixing <em>I wouldn't steal</em> -- it is licensed under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a still of the video bumper. Is the car in a circle-slash an inside joke for CC fans (in the style of CC license icons, which are also used in the bumper), Greens (skeptical of the automobile), merely a literal iconic representation of the video's content, or some combination thereof?</p>

<p>If you're really cutting edge (running an experimental build of Firefox 3 or Opera), you can watch an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora" rel="tag">Ogg Theora</a> encoding of the video inline below via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" rel="tag">HTML5</a> &lt;video&gt; tag:</p>
<p><video controls src="http://www.archive.org/download/IWouldntSteal/iwouldntsteal.net.ogg" id="myVideo"><code>You're not really cutting edge.</code></video></p>
