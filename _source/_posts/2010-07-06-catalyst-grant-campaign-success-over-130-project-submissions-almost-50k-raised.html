<p>Last week our month-long Catalyst Grant campaign drew to a close with <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants#Grant_applications_in_progress_or_submitted">over 130 project applications</a> and <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">nearly $50,000</a> raised to make those ideas a reality.</p>
<p>The Catalyst Grant program wouldn't be possible without the support of the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">254 individual  donors</a> who helped us raise that amount, 100% of which goes to our grant  program. If you'd like to contribute, you can still do so via our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">Donate</a> page and designate "Catalyst Grant program" in the comment box for your contribution to go to this initiative.</p>
<p>The range of topics covered by the projects is quite impressive, and as we spend the next month reviewing the applications, we welcome you, the community, to join us in having a look as well. On each <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants#Grant_applications_in_progress_or_submitted">grant application page</a>, there is a large "Discuss" button which allows you to share your input and read other comments. If you have suggestions for how to improve and develop these proposals, please feel welcome to add your thoughts.</p>
<p>In addition to the community's input, Creative Commons will lead a review process together with a regional committee comprised of CC representatives from Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Latin and North America. The Catalyst Grant campaign was inspired by the fantastic grant programs run by the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Index">Wikimedia Foundation</a> and <a href="http://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/about/#grants">Rising Voices</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the grant applicants and donors for a successful campaign! We look forward to the results of the review, which will be announced in August.</p>
