<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#13">Ben Adida</a> will represent Creative Commons at the <a href="http://w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> Advisory Committee meeting next week, held concurrently with <a href="http://www2004.org/">WWW2004</a> in New York City.</p>
<p>This year has seen a number of new proposals on W3C lists for RDF-in-XHTML.  Ben has been <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2004Mar/0018.html">encouraging</a> the development of a solution that will meet Creative Commons' requirements.  We hope to hear of progress on this front and other <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> issues of interest.  Of course these things take time...</p>
<p>Pity Adida doesn't start with the letter C.</p>
