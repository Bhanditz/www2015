<p><a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> is an interesting weblog data mining tool that tracks links among and between sites. During its recent overhaul, creator <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000226.html">Dave Sifry added a Creative Commons license to the resulting indexes and feeds</a>. This allows others to reprint and produce modified versions of the indexes, as long as  they are not used for commercial purposes (and properly attributed).</p>
<p>It's a refreshing approach by a toolmaker aimed at sharing his community-oriented tools.</p>
