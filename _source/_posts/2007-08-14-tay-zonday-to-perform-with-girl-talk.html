<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/tayzonday">Tay Zonday</a>, the singer/keyboardist behind the insanely popular Creative Commons-licensed hit <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA">"Chocolate Rain"</a> (the video for which has now been viewed on YouTube more than 5.5 million times) is set to make his <a href="http://thedailyswarm.com/swarm/tay-zonday-make-concert-debut-girl-talk-and-dan-deacon-minneapolis/">concert debut</a> in Minneapolis on October 5 at a show featuring none other than remix king <a href="http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic">Girl Talk</a> (who you might recall performed at last September's <a href="http://flavorpill.net/video/2006/10/creative_commons_concert.html">CC benefit show</a> in New York) and eccentric electronic musician <a href="http://www.myspace.com/dandeacon">Dan Deacon</a>. Hooray for Tay!</p>
