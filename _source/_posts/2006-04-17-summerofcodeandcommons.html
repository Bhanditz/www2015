<p>Creative Commons is <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/cc/about.html">participating</a> in Google's 2006 <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> as a mentoring organization. If you're a student please read the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/studentfaq.html">Summer of Code Student FAQ</a>, check out CC's <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Tech_Challenges">Tech Challenges</a> and start thinking about your application. Student proposals will be accepted May 1 through May 8.</p>
<p>We'll have a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summer_of_Code_2006">page dedicated to SoC 2006</a> fleshed out over the next week. You could build infrastructure for the commons and earn $4500. :) Thanks to Google for making this possible!</p>
