<p> The eleventh annual <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/">Media That Matters Film Festival</a> is taking place once again in New York City! More than a film festival, Media That Matters inspires and impacts audiences across the globe. Covering a vast array of topics from LGBT youth, autism awareness, biased-based bullying, immigration and much more, the eleventh annual collection will feature thirteen new shorts. </p>
<p>Arts Engine invites you to their World Premiere, Thursday October 27, 7:00 p.m. at the <a href="http://www.svatheatre.com/">SVA Theatre</a> in New York.

And on Saturday, October 29, Arts Engine will present <a href="http://womenandgirlsmatter.eventbrite.com">Women and Girls Matter</a>, a look at the obstacles and opportunities for women and girls in film making and new media.</p>
