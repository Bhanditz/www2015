<p>In case you missed this week's <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/San_Francisco_Salon">Creative Commons Salon</a> in San Francisco, you can now <a href="http://vidsf.com/2010/may/3/creative-commons-salon-open-education/">view it online</a> thanks to our media sponsor, <a href="http://vidsf.com">VidSF</a>, who filmed and broadcast the event. </p>
<p>We heard from four stellar individuals involved in transforming the education landscape through the power of the internet and digital tools, such as open educational resources (OER). The presenters talked about their and other innovative projects rethinking what a textbook is, what a classroom can be, and how a person should learn. Especially enriching was the panel portion of the evening, when all four presenters came together for a thought-provoking discussion about the roadblocks to implementing a more open approach to education, from a policy perspective as well as in terms of practice, including the important issue of how to get teachers, already over-burdened, more involved in helping to build this pool of shared educational knowledge. </p>
