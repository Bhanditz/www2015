<p><a href="http://pmog.com/" title="pmog.com">PMOG</a> is the <strong>P</strong>assively <strong>M</strong>ultiplayer <strong>O</strong>nline <strong>G</strong>ame, an interesting online gaming experience where players interact with each other with their clicks through the world wide web. PMOG.com explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>PMOG is an infinite game built on individual network histories, transforming our web surfing into ongoing social play. With a game heads-up display in Firefox, players can bomb each other, wage war over web sites, and lead other users on web missions.</p>
<p>This unconventional massively multiplayer online game merges your web life with an alternate, hidden reality. Player behavior generates characters and alliances, triggers interactions in the environment and earns the player points to spend online beefing up their inventory. Suddenly the Internet is not a series of untouchable exhibits, but rather a hackable, rewarding environment!</p></blockquote>
