<p>The Mori Art Museum in Tokyo wanted a new way to engage with their visitors and decided they should encourage them to come take photos at some of their exhibitions, so they picked their current exhibition of Ai Wewei's work titled "According to what?" The exhibit features many large objects and installations and runs through November 8th, so if you're in Tokyo definitely stop by. </p>
<p>What's great </p>
<p> Ai Weiwei is one the most </p>
<p>Exhibition Information</p>
<p>- The latest exhibition at Mori Art Museum, in which CC license is applied,<br />
 is Ai Wewei's solo exhibition, titled "According to what?"<br />
 from 25 July to 8 November 2009.</p>
<p>- Ai Weiwei is one of the most famous artists in China<br />
 as well as an artistic resistant to Chinese government showing<br />
 his opinions through his artworks. Now his blog is shut down<br />
 by Chinese government as he wrote too much claims in it.</p>
<p> FYI) Exhibition website<br />
 http://www.mori.art.museum/english/contents/aiweiwei/index.html</p>
<p>- MAM judged this exhibition was the best chance to let visitors take<br />
 photos, as Ai Weiwei was likely to say OK to adopt Creative Commons,<br />
 and solo exhibition is much easier to clear the copyright issue</p>
<p>- His artworks are mainly huge objects and installations,<br />
 so we need not worry about "illegal duplication" of his artworks<br />
 due to allowing people to take photos</p>
<p>How to apply CC to the exhibition</p>
<p>- CCJP prepared the draft CC license agreement between the museum<br />
 and the artist. Most conservative license CC BY-NC-ND 2.1 Japan<br />
 was chosen to reduce risks.</p>
<p>- Every artwork is allowed to be taken picture<br />
 (Operation might be much harder if the museum had excluded several artworks)</p>
<p>- Put the notice at the entrance and the flyers to give away to visitors,<br />
 showing the instructions people have to follow when take pictures and<br />
 use them later, including CC introduction.</p>
<p>- MAM prohibited these actions;<br />
  No movie shooting<br />
  No tripod<br />
  No flash</p>
<p> Attached please find the files of agreement and instructions.</p>
<p>Some Troubles we face now</p>
<p>- Bad manner; as it's almost the first time Japanese people can<br />
 take picture in a museum, people tend to be too noisy<br />
 taking memorial pictures in the museum, not artwork pictures.</p>
<p>- Noise when people take picture using mobile phone cameras</p>
<p>Next Challenges I'd like to do with CC</p>
<p>- Bring this scheme to other museums in the world<br />
 How about planning a conference gathering art directors/curators<br />
 and CC people together? It seems cultures and attitude of<br />
 museums are now changing to be more open and to be interested<br />
 in using Internet power.</p>
<p> In the US, the conference called "Museum and the web" is held<br />
 and is getting more people worldwide. This conference would be<br />
 a good option to collaborate.</p>
<p> Or promote "Wikipedia Loves Art" scheme to other cities/countries.<br />
 I'd like to think of the event "Creative Commons takes Tokyo",<br />
 imitating "Wikipedia takes Manhattan."</p>
<p> FYI) Museum and the web website<br />
 http://www.archimuse.com/mw2009/index.html</p>
<p>- Provide MAM case information on the CC website<br />
 as other people can use.<br />
 I'll check MAM people if we can provide the documents<br />
 CCJP prepared for this agreement under CC license.</p>
<p>Well, this is the outline of what CCJP done with MA.<br />
If you have any questions, please let me know.</p>
