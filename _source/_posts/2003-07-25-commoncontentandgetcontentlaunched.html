<p>The <a href="http://commoncontent.org/">Common Content Registry of Creative Commons licensed works</a> is now open and is filled with lots of great <a href="http://www.commoncontent.org/catalog/audio/music">music</a>, <a href="http://www.commoncontent.org/catalog/images/photos">photos</a>, <a href="http://www.commoncontent.org/catalog/web/educational/">educational materials</a>, which are available for copying or re-use.  If you've chosen a Creative Commons license for your work, you can <a href="http://www.commoncontent.org/register/">register your work</a> at Common Content so that others may easily find it. </p>
<p>In light of Common Content, and other projects working to facilitate re-use, Creative Commons has discontinued its Content Registry.  All the records hosted here can now be found at <a href="http://commoncontent.org/">Common Content</a>. </p>
<p>To further facilitate re-use, Creative Commons also launched <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/getcontent">the new Get Content page</a>, which lists various large <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/getcontent#portals">portals that host Creative Commons licensed content</a>, archived <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/getcontent#fcontent">Featured Content of the Week</a> records, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/getcontent#fcommoners">archived Featured Commoner interviews</a>.  Check it out, and start getting content for copying and re-use! </p>
