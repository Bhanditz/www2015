There's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/27/science/space/27WATC.html?pagewanted=all&position=">a nice piece in the NYTimes</a> about the increased levels of public participation in recent Mars landings. A big part of the reason is that given a large, interested population with broadband connections, NASA officials have done their best to <a href="http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/">share every bit of data, image, and video they can online</a>, and as a result thousands of websites have cropped up including those by <a href="http://q.queso.com/archives/001346">laymen colorizing images</a> and even <a href="http://www.markcarey.com/mars/">weblogs</a> written from the rover's point of view.</p>
<p>
Thanks to NASA sharing every bit of information they can online, the experience of watching the Mars landing and exploration for students and observers today is a far cry from the days of the moon landing. Instead of a one-way communication delivered by grainy video on television, we have an interactive, two-way process where the viewer can help scientists on the other side of the globe and take in information along with millions of others, sharing their own interpretations online.</p>
