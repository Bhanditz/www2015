<p>Two recent posts on Lessig's blog show that both of the major party US presidential candidates support the idea of debate footage being available to the public for free and legal use.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Lessig posted a <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/great_news_from_the_mccain_cam_1.html">letter of reply</a> he'd received from Trevor Potter, the general counsel of the McCain-Palin campaign. The letter says that the campaign "supports [the] suggestion that those who may own rights in the debate video dedicate those rights to the public domain." Potter continues: "Barring that, copyright holders should at the very least give utmost respect to principles of fair use by allowing non-commercial use of debate excerpts, thus ensuring that spurious copyright claims do not chill vigorous public discourse."</p>
<p>Then, on Saturday, Lessig blogged that Barack Obama had <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/10/obama_on_open_debates_1.html">reaffirmed</a> his support for open debates, which he'd earlier established during the primaries via a letter to DNC Chairman Howard Dean. Obama's letter asks that debate footage "be available freely after the debate, by either placing the video in the public domain, or licensing it under a Creative Commons (Attribution) license."</p>
<p>We couldn't have said it better ourselves.</p>
