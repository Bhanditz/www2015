You keep notes on paper (hopefully, a notebook, and not just loose pages), in word-processing documents unhelpfully named "notes" followed by "notes1," "notes2" or worse, "notes_old," "notes_old1." You manage your bibliography on your desktop or on the web, you have a directory folder full of images, charts, photos and other media, and you collaborate with your co-authors by emailing attachments back and forth. </p>
<p>Sooner or later you start doubting your sanity but you soldier on. Finally you publish your paper, heave a sigh of relief, and move on, thereby ensuring your data can't be reused and your work can't be reproduced easily.</p>
<p>Several <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki/people-attending">coders, designers, scientists, and publishers</a> met at PLOS to brainstorm toward a better, more modern way. The <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki">Markdown for Science workshop</a> was organized by <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/13/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/">Martin Fenner</a> and <a href="http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start">Stian HÃ¥klev</a> and supported by a <a href="http://www.force11.org/node/4358">1K Challenge Grant from FORCE11</a>.</p>

<p>While a lot of good ideas were generated, we have a long way to go. <a href="https://github.com/scholmd/markdown_science/wiki">Keep an eye on this project</a>, and better yet, pitch in with your ideas and code. Together we can tame this beast.</p>
