<p>Just a quick reminder that the CC Salon NYC is happening tomorrow night!</p>
<p><a href="http://topp.openplans.org/project-home">The Open Planning Project</a> has once again generously allowed us to use their loft space in the West Village for the salon and a reception afterward. </p>
<p>September's Salon will feature presentations from <a href="http://www.groundreport.com">Rachel Sterne from GroundReport.com</a>, and a special screening / premier of two new shorts from the <a href="http://www.meerkatmedia.org/">Meerkat Arts Media Collective</a>, and other special surprises.</p>
<p>Here are the details:<br />
<strong><br />
Tuesday, September 30th, from 7-10pm<br />
The Open Planing Project<br />
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=349+W.+12th+St.++&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=addr">349 W. 12th St.</a>, 1st Floor<br />
</strong></p>
<p>We'll also have free (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_beer">as in beer</a>) beer for the reception afterward.  If you didn't make it to July's salon, don't miss this one, and if you did, <strong>you'll know to come early as space is limited</strong>. </p>
<p>Follow the event via <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1025469/?ps=7">Upcoming.org</a> and RSVP via the <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/event.php?eid=31779429809&ref=share">Facebook event</a> or e-mailing me - fred [at] creativecommons.org</p>
