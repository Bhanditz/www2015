<p>On Wednesday, July 11th, from 7-9 PM, Creative Commons will be returning to <a href="http://shinesf.com/">Shinesf.com</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1337+Mission+St.+San+Francisco&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">1337 Mission St. in San Francisco</a>) for another <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">Creative Commons Salon</a>! There is a lot of wonderful things in store and it is a great opportunity to meet-up with others interested in Creative Commons' flexible licensing, technology and standards and informally discuss how we can all work together.</p>
<p>Confirmed to present is <a href="http://jumpcut.com/">Yahoo's Jumpcut Online Video Editing Community</a>, who will be discussing how their new online video service  allows for both uploading of videos as well as online remxing/editing . Also presenting will be <a href="http://www.owlmusicsearch.com/">OWL Music Search</a>, whose audio similarity search engine allows you to find CC-licensed music through an online comparison with your own mp3s (we've talked about OWL before <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6143">here</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7220">here</a>). Lastly, but certainly not least, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">slideshare.net</a> (discussed earlier <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7452">here</a>) will be presenting <em>Powerpoint Karaoke</em>, MC-ed by EFF's <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/#danny_obrien">Danny O'Brien</a>! We can only imagine the hilarity that will ensue...</p>
