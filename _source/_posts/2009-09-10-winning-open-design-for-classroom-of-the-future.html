<p>On Monday, the <a href="http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/competitions/challenge/2009">2009 Open Architecture Challenge</a> announced the winning design for a sustainable classroom of the future, concluding a competition with over 1,000 registrants from 65 countries around the world. Of the 400 designs entered, the winning design was developed by <a href="http://www.tetonvalleycommunityschool.com/newsEvents_announcementsDetail.php?pkAnnouncements=7">Teton Valley Community School</a> and <a href="http://www.sectioneightdesign.com/">Section Eight Design</a>. They were awarded $50,000 to translate their design into action, with a $5,000 grant for Section Eight to help them.</p>
<p>The winning design is not the only outcome of this challenge, however, as all other designs are <a href="http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org/competitions/challenge/2009/entries">openly available online</a> via various Creative Commons Licenses (the winning design is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>) for others to improve, adapt, and implement themselves, which calls for additional support in much-needed areas. The massive response by schools and design companies around the world also signifies how learning has evolved, and how the old brick and mortar classroom is no longer considered sustainable. By redesigning our learning spaces, we are making concrete the new technologies and pedagogies of the 21st century.</p>
