<a href="http://gnomoradio.org/">Gnomoradio</a> is a new project to create a free software package that will allow people to share Creative Commons licensed audio.  While there are no downloadable clients currently, the project is proceeding rapidly and they have put <a href="http://gnomoradio.org/announcement.php">a call out for musicians</a> wanting to release their licensed music to the network.</p>
