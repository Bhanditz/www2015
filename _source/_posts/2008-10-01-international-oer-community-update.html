<p>The Open Educational Resources (OER) movement is a globalÂ movement. Education is an issue that crosses borders and spans continents; open educationâ€”the creation and distribution of OERâ€”empowers people in a global dialogue. However, the mere promotion of OER is not sufficient for the success of this international effort, as many issues and barriers to open education are country- and culture-specific. In this sense, the international OER community has some significant differences to bridge, and we must somehow synthesize the diverse range of projects and perspectives into clear and tangibleÂ objectives.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=OER_Community">UNESCO OER Community</a> exemplifies progress made on this front, with currently 700+ members from 105 countries. Although North America and Western Europe account for about half of the participants, the community is still represented by 72 developing countries. One of the most compelling components of the community is its <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=OER_stories">case studies</a> project, "stories - of howÂ institutions and individuals have developed or used OER," based in various countries. These case studiesâ€”including those from Canada, Rwanda, Italy, South Africa, New Zealand, the Netherlands and moreâ€”explore OER against the background of their heterogeneous contexts. What works? What doesn't work? What did the organization or persons involved do or must they now do in order to overcome obstaclesâ€”either due to institutional bureaucracy, lack of resources, or otherwise? These stories are windows of insight into different ways of progressingÂ globally.</p>
<p>In addition to case studies, the international community is developing an <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit">OER toolkit</a>, <a href="http://wiki.oercommons.org/mediawiki/index.php/OER_Storytelling_Project">templates</a> for ease of sharing more stories (from community members, academics creating and using OER, and learners using OER), and discussion surrounding such issues as access to technology, copyright, best practices, learning psychology of OER, and more. The OER toolkit will prove especially useful in addressing the issues raised by case studies, as it targets any persons interested in becoming involved with OER, either as creators or users, and those wishing to integrate OER into their institutions or organizations.</p>
<p>eLearning Papers, a journal that "promotes the use of ICT for lifelong learning in Europe," recently examined similar issues surrounding OER and the international community in its September installment, "<a href="http://www.elearningpapers.eu/index.php?page=home&amp;vol=10">Open Educational Resources</a>." From the <a href="http://www.elearningpapers.eu/index.php?page=volume">editorial</a>,</p>
<p>"<em>This issue of eLearning Papers is dedicated to the thriving work around Open Educational Resources (OER) by committed individuals, institutions and user communities. Five selected papers by the guest editors investigate the organisational, social, cultural, pedagogical and technical aspects of implementing OER...</em></p>
<p><em>We have two papers that investigate how higher education institutions work OER into their policies and practices. "Open Educational Resources for Management Education: Lessons from experience" elaborates on a French faculty which created a digital distribution place to share and disseminate university courses. The initial resistance of the faculty members evaporated as they started receiving positive feedback on their courses, as well as international interest in their French content. On the other hand, "Reflections on sustaining Open Educational Resources: an institutional case study" shows how first gaining high level policy support within the institution for the initiative of OER was turned into a sustainable institutional practice.</em>"</p>
