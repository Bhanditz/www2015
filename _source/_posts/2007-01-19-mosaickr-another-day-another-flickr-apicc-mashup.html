<p><a href="http://www.mosaickr.com/">Mosaickr</a> helps you build mosaics from Flickr photos published under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Attribution</a> license (and your own photos). The process is simple: 1) choose a master image, which will serve as a template for the mosaic, 2) choose images that will be used to fill in the mosaic and 3) download your mosaic.</p>
<p>Any art form takes skill and patience. My first attempt using an image of (cc) stickers as the master and images tagged 'cloud' as fillers is not good enough to publish.</p>
