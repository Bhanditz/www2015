<a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7220">Linux Journal has a great interview with John Buckman from Magnatune</a>, the non-evil record label that sells Creative Commons licensed music on a sliding scale. It's turning out to be lucrative for the artists involved, with the average musician taking in $1,500 in royaltes last year and the top artists making over $6,000 in royalties (which are 50% of sales).</p>
<p>
While six thousand dollars won't buy you a Bentley or a mansion for MTV Cribs, most artists listed at Magnatune are independent musicians that record at home. Considering that for most Magnatune artists, it means sending a few high quality recordings to a server and later getting thousands of dollars in royalties, it's a pretty good system for the struggling musician. Combined with the services of something like <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3970">Pump Audio</a>, today's independent artist has a lot of avenues to make money off their music while still letting others share it freely online.</p>
