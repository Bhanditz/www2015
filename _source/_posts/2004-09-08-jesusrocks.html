<p>Three Taiwan Golden Melody Award winners, including a famous singer and composer, Yue-hsin Chu, and a group of enthusiastic young Christian musicians have come up with what they call their first native gospel album -- <a href="http://youth.pct.org.tw/music/">JESUS ROCKS</a>.</p>
<p>JESUS ROCKS is the first Asian album using a Creative Commons license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/tw/">Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike Taiwan</a>).</p>
<p>The cover text reads: "JESUS ROCKS represents the sprit of reciprocal sharing. It also conveys the charity of Jesus Christ in English, Mandarin and dialects of Mandarin. JESUS ROCKS covers diverse styles, such as rock'n'roll, folk, blues and funk. So it is suitable for different generations to listen."</p>
