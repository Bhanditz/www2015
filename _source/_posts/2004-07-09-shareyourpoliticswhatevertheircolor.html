<p><a href="http://www.actblue.com">ActBlue</a> is a web site that bills itself as an "online clearinghouse for grassroots action."  As the name suggests, it's a site designed to help Democratic partisans find candidates to support, both with money and with time.  But it also supplies tools to help users band together with like-minded souls -- <a href="http://actblue.com/lists">creating customized lists</a> of important races and spreading them around.</p>
<p>
What makes the site so cool is that it -- and all of the lists and other content users upload -- is available under the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 license</a>.  That means that other organizations can pick up and work off the grassroots energy of ActBlue, whether those other groups are the Democrats for a Democratic Midwest or the Red State Republicans.  ActBlue may be Democrat-themed, but as online grassroots organizing and Internet-sparked individual involvement in politics spreads across the political spectrum -- from ActGreen to ActRed -- everyone wins, and so does democracy itself.  Kudos to ActBlue for sharing the love.</p>
