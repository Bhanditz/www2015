<p><strong>Creative Commons Launches Third Annual Fundraising Campaign</strong></p>
<p><strong>San Francisco, CA USA â€” October 1, 2007</strong></p>
<p>Today, Creative Commons officially launched its third annual fundraising campaign. The past two fundraising campaigns generated vital financial support for Creative Commons. This year, the organization is asking its community for help in raising funds before January 1, 2008.</p>
<p>â€œOur annual campaign measures our success in building a movement and community,â€ said Lawrence Lessig, CEO of Creative Commons. â€œIt is critical that we meet our goal, and I am confident that we will.â€</p>
<p>The goals of the 2007 campaign are to raise at least $500,000 and to highlight the CC community â€” the people dedicated to expanding the depth, breadth, and impact of free digital culture. â€œBuilding and supporting the Creative Commons community is equally as important as fundraising, when it comes to ensuring CCâ€™s future,â€ said Melissa Reeder, CCâ€™s development coordinator.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the campaign, CC will unveil a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">redesigned website</a>, which will include a dynamic global map that shows precisely where in the world CCâ€™s support is coming from. Creative Commons will also offer a limited edition t-shirt as a premium for all donations above $75.</p>
<p>Other features of the campaign include the second annual CC Swag Photo Contest, the â€œCommonerâ€ letter series, and the Corporate Commoner Giving Program. More information about each of these projects is below.</p>
<p><strong>CC Swag Photo Contest:</strong><br />
Last year, Creative Commons instituted the CC Swag Photo Contest, to offer people another way to promote and support Creative Commons during the campaign. For more information on the 2006 contest and to see the entries, please visit <a href="http://www.support.creativecommons.org/contest/">http://support.creativecommons.org/contest/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>â€œCommoner Lettersâ€ Series:</strong><br />
Creative Commons will launch its â€œCommoner Lettersâ€ Series. This new series will consist of letters from five prominent CC community members about why they support Creative Commons. The series will be bookended with letters from Creative Commons CEO Lawrence Lessig. If you would like to receive these letters, please subscribe here: <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/letters">http://support.creativecommons.org/letters</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Commoner Giving Program:</strong><br />
Creative Commons has now launched a giving program specifically for companies. For more information, visit <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/donate/corporate">http://support.creativecommons.org/donate/corporate</a>.</p>
<p>As a way to kick off the campaign, Six Apart will deliver a presentation at the CC SF Salon on Oct. 10th. The company will also give a large donation to Creative Commons, which was raised entirely by the LiveJournal community.</p>
