<a href="http://www.nature.com">Nature</a>, the international weekly journal of science just released an advanced version of a paper entitled  '<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/abs/nature08182.html">Origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza A epidemic</a>' under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike license</a>. </p>
<p>While this is indeed great news in and of itself, you might have noticed that the license notification didn't quite make it to the early PDF version of the paper. We're willing to chalk it up to the fact that the paper isn't in its final version, but we'll be looking for the CC license badge when that one comes out. </p>
