<p>In August <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33832">we wrote</a> about the European Commission's request for information on the topic <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/consult/open_en.htm"><em>Opening Up Education</em></a>. The point of the consultation is to gauge the need for EU action to promote the adoption and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in education. Several Creative Commons affiliates in Europe have <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/EC_Consultation_Opening_Up_Education">submitted a joint response</a> to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/forms/dispatch?form=OpeningUpEducation">survey</a>. The jurisdictions signing onto the response include <strong>Luxembourg, Denmark, Greece, Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom, Sweden, Czech Republic,  France, Portugal, Serbia, Poland, Netherlands, Finland, Bulgaria, and Ireland</strong>. </p>
<p>The joint response urges the Commission to support the recommendations in the <a href="/weblog/entry/33089">2012 Paris OER Declaration</a>, which was unanimously supported by UNESCO member nations at the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33089">World Open Educational Resources Congress</a> on 20-22 June 2012. As described in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/documents/consult/open_en.pdf">consultation document</a> (PDF), â€œthe EU will use the tools at its disposal (policy guidance, EU regulation whenever relevant, funding mechanisms, exchange of good practices and innovative pilots).â€ By leveraging these various tools in alignment with the suggestions laid out in the Paris Declaration, the Commission can be very effective in promoting the development and use of OER. Those recommendations urge UNESCO member nations to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Foster awareness and use of OER.</li>
<li>Facilitate enabling environments for use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT).</li>
<li>Reinforce the development of strategies and policies on OER.</li>
<li>Promote the understanding and use of open licensing frameworks.</li>
<li>Support capacity building for the sustainable development of quality learning materials.</li>
<li>Foster strategic alliances for OER.</li>
<li>Encourage the development and adaptation of OER in a variety of languages and cultural contexts.</li>
<li>Encourage research on OER.</li>
<li>Facilitate finding, retrieving and sharing of OER.</li>
<li>Encourage the open licensing of educational materials produced with public funds.</li>
</ol>
<p>The European Commission is in a position to help coordinate, promote, and support most&#160;&#8212; if not all&#160;&#8212; of these recommendations. In addition, these recommendations align with the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm">Europe 2020 priorities</a>, especially in increasing effective investments in education by encouraging free open access to publicly funded educational content. </p>
<p>The Paris Declaration reaffirms OER as â€œteaching, learning and research materials in any medium, digital or otherwise, that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.â€ The EC should support this definition of OER so that users of OER know the rights available to them and so that producers of OER get the credit they deserve. Since a clear legal framework is crucial to the success of OER, we strongly suggest that the  EC consider promoting the use of Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">licenses</a> and public domain tools like the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a> Public Domain Dedication. CC licenses are globally applicable and are seen as the gold standard for open content licensing. It would be beneficial for the EC to adopt CC licenses because they are already <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/IGO">established</a> and understood, instead of creating customized licenses that may not interoperate with existing solutions.</p>
