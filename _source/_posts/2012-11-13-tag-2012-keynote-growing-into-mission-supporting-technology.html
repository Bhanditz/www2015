<p>Today, I'm honored to be a keynote speaker at the Technology Affinity Group conference in Monterey, CA. I'll be talking about my career and my experiences in the open space, and sharing three suggestions for the foundation community:</p>
<p><strong>Technology deserves a bigger place at the table.</strong> Technology is what drives the big innovations in the philanthropic world, but all too often, the technology people don't have enough of a voice in a foundation's leadership. That's a problem that I think foundations need to address before they can work at full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Share by default.</strong> When foundations share their data, it's often the exception rather than the rule. What if foundations made sharing <em>the default</em>? Yesterday, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35165">we blogged about</a> a group of foundations making a commitment to share their grant data regularly, openly, and in a usable format. I'll be applauding the Reporting Commitment and urging other foundations to get onboard.</p>
<p><strong>Bake open into philanthropy.</strong> Every foundation wants to get the most good for its money. There's a strong argument that grant dollars go further if they go toward openly-licensed work and resources.</p>
