<p>ccLearn presented on CC and Open Educational Resources at the <a href="http://www.whipplehill.com/events/uc/2009/">WhippleHill User Conference</a> yesterday in Boston. <a href="http://www.whipplehill.com/">WhippleHill Communications</a> is a company that started off more or less building websites for schools. As the Internet evolved, so did WhippleHill's business model into a service one meeting schools' online communication needs. WhippleHill targets independent high schools and is a for-profit. However, like a lot of companies who offer services around next generation web technologies, they promote open content and tools for their clients. They also host an annual user conference where they invite cutting edge initiatives to lead sessions on new media and technologies pertinent to the changing world. ccLearn had the opportunity to lead one of these sessions entitled, "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/janeatcc/cc-and-oer-presentation-at-whipple-hill-user-conference-09">Creative Commons and Open Educational Resources: How the world is changing and what you need to know to keep up</a>" targeted mainly at education around CC and copyright for high school students.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/janeatcc/cc-and-oer-presentation-at-whipple-hill-user-conference-09">slide show</a> is up under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> (except otherwise noted). We would like to acknowledge Jessica Coates' slide show "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Jessicacoates/creative-commons-in-the-classroom-presentation">Creative Commons in the Classroom</a>" from which we co-opted some great slides! </p>
<p>Thanks again to WhippleHill and its President, Travis Warren, for the strong support!</p>
