<p><a href="http://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/backstage/index.whtml"><img src="img/rdlogo.png" alt="R&#038;DTV Logo" title="R&#038;DTV Logo" width="180" height="110" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13951" /></a><a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=13915&preview=true">Turning the tables</a>, the BBC recently interviewed Digg's Kevin Rose for their <a href="http://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/backstage/index.whtml">R&DTV</a> series. R&DTV is a monthly program consisting of interviews with BBC developers and technology leaders. In conjunction to licensing the shows under our Attribution-NonCommercial license, the BBC is also releasing all of the content that got left on the cutting room floor in their "<a href="http://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/backstage/rdtv/episode1/">Asset Bundles</a>." This is a fantastic effort for the commons, so hats off to the BBC!</p>
