<p><a href="http://www.team9.net/">team9</a>, an Australian based electro act fronted by producer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team9">Neil Mason</a>, just released their latest album <em>We Don't Disco</em> for <a href="http://www.team9.net/">free download</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA license</a>. From <a href="http://www.team9.net/">team9</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I've spent the last few months neck deep on an original album - the first since 2003. 'We Dont Disco' is an electronic soundtrack to the days of my life. A little bit ambient, a little bit pop, a little bit dance......its a little bit kind of thing. If you like it then great, its free to download and completely copyright free - yep, a first on this web site - and is licensed under a Creative Commons 'Attribution License'. Please feel free to use any song in any which way you choose.</p></blockquote>
<p>An avid remix artist, team9 has chosen to release song stems for four of their tracks (<em>Lines</em>, <em>We Don't Disco Like We Used To</em>, <em>Five Times</em>, and <em>As We Travel</em>), allowing potential remixers a simple way to re-imagine team9's original tracks. </p>
<p>team9 also recently finished work on <a href="http://stereogum.com/archives/mp3/stereogum-team9-present-mysplice-iii_041871.html"><em>MySplice III</em></a>, a collaboration between team9 and music blog <a href="http://stereogum.com/">Stereogum</a> that mashes together some of this year's most popular tracks. </p>
