<strong>From last weekâ€™s episode:</strong><br />
Next week, I'll turn to some of the critics of Creative Commons. But  this week, indeed, right now, we still need your <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">support</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>The story continuedâ€¦</strong><br />
Creative Commons is a young organization. And while weâ€™ve been more  successful than I ever imagined weâ€™d be, weâ€™ve also made mistakes.  Some of these mistakes weâ€™ve corrected. Some I hope to persuade us to  correct. But throughout the three years since our launch, we have  worked hard to build a solid and sustainable infrastructure of  freedoms for creators.</p>
<p>
Along the way, we have picked up some critics. I donâ€™t have the space  here to address every criticism. In this email, Iâ€™ll talk about just  two &mdash; one directed at our NonCommercial license option, and the other  at two of CCâ€™s non-core licenses. But Iâ€™ll continue this discussion  next year in a new forum that weâ€™ll launch just for this purpose.  Mark Shuttleworth is my model here, and I will be a part of that  discussion whenever I can.</p>
<p>
In the meantime, a bit from our critics.</p>
<p>
(1) Criticism of the use of Noncommercial licenses<br />
In an article in <a href="http://intelligentdesigns.net">http://intelligentdesigns.net</a>, Erik MÃ¶ller argues  against the use of a Creative Commons NonCommercial (NC) license. His  argument has five parts, but the core is a concern about  incompatibility. As he puts it, â€œ[f]ree content is no longer a fringe  movement.â€ He cites Wikipedia as an obvious example, and correctly  points out that content licensed under a NC license canâ€™t be included  within Wikipedia. This is a problem, he argues, especially for  â€œcollaborative projects.â€ As he says, â€œmarking up regions of content  as non-commercial and consistently following these boundaries is  almost impossible in a collaborative environment.â€</p>
<p>
MÃ¶ller is absolutely right. The NC license does interfere with this  sort of collaboration. It does create potential incompatibility. Of  course, as MÃ¶ller also acknowledges, there is incompatibility even  without the NC restriction: As I described <a href="http:// creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5709">last week</a>, itâ€™s not possible to mix  content licensed under the FDL with even an equivalent CC license.  Thatâ€™s because both licenses, as they are presently designed, block  interoperability. This is a real problem for the ecology of free  culture. And again, as I argued last week, this is a problem that  Creative Commons intends to fix by launching a project to federate  free licenses to encourage interoperability between licenses of the  same type.</p>
<p>
Yet even if we succeed with federation, the problem that MÃ¶ller  describes will remain. Some license types are incompatible with  others. And among the kinds of incompatibility most likely to cause  trouble is exactly the sort MÃ¶ller has identified: The NC restriction  will block content from being included within ShareAlike projects  such as Wikipedia.</p>
<p>
So whatâ€™s the solution? My recommendation is much like MÃ¶llerâ€™s &mdash; use  the least restrictive license that you can. But I say â€œmuch like  MÃ¶llerâ€™sâ€ because my sense is that heâ€™d really like to see the NC  license never used at all, and I believe, given the wide range of  creators using CC licenses, there are important cases where a NC  license makes sense.</p>
<p>
For example, imagine youâ€™re in a band and youâ€™ve recorded a new song.  Youâ€™re happy to have it spread around the Internet. But youâ€™re not  keen that Sony include it on a CD &mdash; at least without asking you  first. If you release the song under a simple Attribution license  thereâ€™s no reason Sony (or anyone else) couldnâ€™t take your song and  sell it. And I personally see nothing wrong with you wanting to  reserve your commercial rights so that Sony has to ask you permission  (and pay you) before they can profit from your music.</p>
<p>
MÃ¶ller suggests you can avoid this problem by copylefting the song,  using, for example, a CC-ShareAlike term. As he argues, â€œ[a]ny  company trying to exploit your work will have to make their â€˜added  valueâ€™ available for free to everyone. Seen like this, the â€˜riskâ€™ of  exploitation turns into a potentially powerful benefit.â€</p>
<p>
But this is not quite right. The ShareAlike requirement kicks in only  if the adopter makes a â€œderivative workâ€ out of the song. Merely  adding it to a CD isnâ€™t a derivative work. So thatâ€™s not a sufficient  protection against this particular form of exploitation. And it is  thus for this sort of case that the NC term is designed.</p>
<p>
It is certainly true, however, that for a great deal of the  creativity being added to the net &mdash; especially in the context of  collaboration &mdash; thereâ€™s not much need to protect commercial rights.  My blog, for example, is licensed under a simple Attribution license.  CNET Japan translates the blog and sells advertising around its  content. For my purposes, thatâ€™s just fine. I write to spread ideas;  I try to avoid tariffs where I can. From my perspective, MÃ¶ller is  certainly correct: the least restrictive license is enough for me.  And I would generalize the point: We all should use the least  restrictive licenses that we can, consistent with our goals.</p>
<p>
Weâ€™ve not done a good enough job helping users understand this.  MÃ¶ller is right to call upon Creative Commons to do better. We will  do just that. But the lesson MÃ¶ller is absolutely right to teach is  that we all should consider the consequences of our choices. Some  will want nothing more than that their content be available  noncommercially. For them, the NC license is a useful option. But  others really simply want their work used and incorporated into the  remix of the net. For them, the NC option may do more harm than good.</p>
<p>
(2) Criticism of the Sampling and Developing Nations License<br />
Creative Commons offers six core licenses. Each of these six gives  people the freedom â€œto copy, distribute, display, and performâ€ the  work. But in addition to these core licenses, Creative Commons offers  two licenses that donâ€™t give these freedoms. These are the "Sampling"  License, and the "Developing Nations" License.</p>
<p>
The Sampling license was inspired by the band Negativland and one of  Brazilâ€™s most famous musicians and current Culture Minister, Gilberto  Gil. Basically, it say this: you can remix, or â€œsampleâ€ this content.  The default Sampling license says you can even remix for commercial  purpose. But the default Sampling license also says you donâ€™t have  permission to copy, distribute, display or perform the underlying  work. Those rights are reserved. The only right given away is  essentially the right to make a certain kind of derivative.</p>
<p>
The Developing Nations license is different. It was inspired by  activists in the Access2Knowledge movement &mdash;most prominently, Jamie  Love. They wanted a license that would free content (completely)  within developing nations even if it wouldnâ€™t alter the rules for  that content outside of developing nations. So the Developing Nations  license basically says that this content is free even for commercial  use within a developing nation. But outside of the developing  nations, ordinary rules apply. That means for content licensed under  the DevNat license, outside of developing nations, there is no right  to copy, distribute, display or perform the underlying work.</p>
<p>
Richard Stallman criticizes the one element that these two licenses  have in common &mdash; that while they both secure important freedoms, they  also both forbid (for some groups at least) the right to â€œcopyâ€ the  underlying work. For him, that right is fundamental. And thus for  him, any license that denies this fundamental freedom does not  deserve the support of Creative Commons. Heâ€™s thus asked us to either  drop, or disassociate ourselves from, these two licenses.</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s extremely important first to clarify what this disagreement is  not. Some of you will remember the battles between the â€œfree  softwareâ€ and â€œopen source softwareâ€ movements. To some, those were  battles between a movement that believed in values and a movement  that believed in pragmatism. The disagreement between CC and Richard  Stallman is not of that sort. It isnâ€™t pragmatism that drives us to  adopt the Sampling and DevNat license. It is instead a different  conception of value. CC will never offer licenses that secure just  any freedom; we believe CC licenses should only secure important  freedoms. But thatâ€™s precisely what we believe these two licenses do  &mdash; they secure important freedoms, even if they donâ€™t include the  freedom to copy. Thatâ€™s not because the freedom to copy is not an  important freedom in some contexts, or for some creators. But the  freedom to copy is not an important freedom in all contexts &mdash; at least if it interferes with other important values.</p>
<p>
For example, imagine youâ€™re a teacher in Nigeria. You want textbooks  to teach Algebra to your Fulani speaking students. That you would  have the right to copy a particular English textbook isnâ€™t really of  much use to you. What you need is the right to translate that book.  In that context, the derivative right is the critical one; the right  to copy is unimportant.</p>
<p>
The same point could be made more generally. Our view is that the  necessary freedoms in different domains of creativity are not  necessarily the same. That music could be different from software,  software different from film. And as we have done throughout this  project, we have asked leaders in different fields who share the  values of freedom to help us understand what values are important  within those specific fields. Gil and Negativland know something  about music. So when they say that the freedom to remix is critical  even if the freedom to copy is not, it would take a great deal to  persuade us they are wrong.</p>
<p>
The same is true of the DevNat license. The target here is creativity  that depends upon a domestic market but never expects to exploit a  developing nations market. So, for example, one of the coolest  adopters of these licenses are architects designing low-cost housing.  Theyâ€™ve marked their designs with the DevNat license, meaning people  in the developing world are free to do with them what they want. But  in their view, at least, they canâ€™t also give these designs freely to  their direct competitors.</p>
<p>
These creators may be wrong. Gil, Negativland, and Jamie Love might  be mistaken about what rights the relevant creators need to keep. But  whatâ€™s needed is an informed debate among creators about what  freedoms they need. We hope to encourage this debate. But in the  meantime, weâ€™ll continue to guide ourselves based upon the values  that the relevant communities have identified.</p>
<p>
As Iâ€™ve said, there is much more I should say about other thoughtful  criticism. This email, however, is already too long. Weâ€™ll announce  the discussion space sometime early in the next year. And stay tuned  next week when Iâ€™ll turn to some of the particular projects weâ€™re  working on right now &mdash; as well as ask again for your <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">support</a>.</p>
