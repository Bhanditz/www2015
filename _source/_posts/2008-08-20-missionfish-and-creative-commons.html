<p>MissionFish has partnered with Ebay to help nonprofits receive funds through the online auction community. Now that Creative Commons has established ourselves with MissionFish, our supporters can </p>
<p>in three different ways:<br />
* Ebay sellers can designate that a portion or all of their profit will go to Creative Commons; 2) CC can sell items directly on Ebay (such as in-kind donations we can't use), and our seller profile will specify that we are a non-profit and that the revenue goes toward our org; 3) Ebayers can donate to CC through Paypal.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about any of these three modes of fundraising, go to http://www.missionfish.org/fundraise/us_fundraise.html. It's all laid out in a concise and easy to understand manner.</p>
