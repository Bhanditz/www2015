<p>Last week I gave a talk on the licences and their relationship to the public domain at the ATRIP Conference in Utrecht, Holland. ATRIP is the  <a href="http://www.atrip.org">International Association for the Advancement of Teaching and Research in Intellectual Property</a>. Abraham Drassinower of the University of Toronto Law School gave a fascinating paper dealing with <a href="http://www.canlii.org/ca/cas/scc/2004/2004scc13.html">CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada</a>, a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada involving a fresh look at the nature of authorship. I hope we can blog the paper later on. Many thanks to Professor Grosheide and the organizers for this spendid opportunity to situate our project in a wider context and to spread the word.</p>
