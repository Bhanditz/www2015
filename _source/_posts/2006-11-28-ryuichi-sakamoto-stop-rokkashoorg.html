<p>Esteemed composer and musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryuichi_Sakamoto">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> has launched <a href="http://stop-rokkasho.org/">stop-rokkasho.org</a> in response to the opening of a nuclear reprocessing plant in the Japanese village of Rokkasho. To lead off an international awareness campaign, Sakamoto wrote and recorded a track called <a href="http://stop-rokkasho.org/hear/">"Rokkasho"</a> â€” featuring rapper <a href="http://www.e22.com/shing02/">Shing02</a> and guitarist/producer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennesz">Christian Fennesz</a> â€” under the group name Team 6.
