<p>Recent link offerings in celebration of Public Domain Day, which is January 1...</p>
<p>Creative Commons Switzerland informs us of <a href="http://www.creativecommons.ch/weblog/entry/68">a Public Domain Day jam session/brunch in Zurich</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Short English Summary: We will celebrate the public domain day on January 1 in Zurich. We will read, perform, transform works from authors whose work are in the public domain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tuesday CC board member Michael Carroll blogged about the <a href="http://carrollogos.blogspot.com/2008/12/digital-public-domain.html">meaning and potential of the Digital Public Domain</a> and last month about <a href="http://carrollogos.blogspot.com/2008/11/jillian-raye-and-bard-vitality-of.html">things made possible by the public domain</a>.</p>
