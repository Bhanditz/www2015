<p>Creative Commons, a globally-focused nonprofit that provides legal and technological tools for sharing and collaboration, welcomed eight new members to its board of directors today. It also announced a new advisory council to complement the board and provide input and feedback to CC leadership. Several alumni of the CC board will be transitioning to the advisory council. CC co-founder Lawrence Lessig will lead the advisory council and transition to emeritus status on the board.</p>
<p>The announcement comes on the anniversary of the first Creative Commons licenses, which were launched in 2002. Since then, thousands of creators around the world have used Creative Commons licenses, amassing a selection of over half a billion CC-licensed works, spanning the worlds of education, art, academia, data, science, and much more.</p>
<p>"With the continuity of current board members and a fresh outlook brought by the new members, Creative Commons is well prepared to engage with a very different environment from the time of its founding," board chair Paul Brest said. "The board includes some of the worldâ€™s foremost experts in technology, intellectual property  law, the internet, and business and social entrepreneurship. Itâ€™s appropriate that weâ€™re announcing the new board on December 16, the date when it all began eleven years ago."</p>
<p>The new board members reflect the broad diversity of the global Creative Commons community. Four of the new board members&#160;&#8212; Renata Avila (Guatemala), Dorothy Gordon (Ghana), Paul Keller (Netherlands), and Jongsoo Yoon (South Korea)&#160;&#8212; are Creative Commons affiliates, experts who represent Creative Commons around the world and localize CC licenses and other materials for their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Creative Commons also gained board members with substantial experience in technology and product development, like Ben Adida, a director of engineering at Square who previously served as CC's first technology lead; and Christopher Thorne, a veteran technology entrepreneur and private equity investor. The new members also bring additional legal acumen to the organization, including Microsoft intellectual property counsel Thomas C. Rubin and New York University Law School professor Chris Sprigman. Together, these individuals will augment Creative Commons' existing capacity in technology and intellectual property law.</p>
<p>Creative Commons CEO Cathy Casserly will be leaving her role as CEO in early 2014, but will continue to serve on the newly formed advisory council. "While my role in the organization will be changing, I'm proud to continue to serve the CC community alongside this diverse and talented group of leaders," Casserly said. "Through our collective efforts, we will continue to work toward our vision of a truly collaborative, free internet."</p>
