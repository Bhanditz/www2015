<p>Matt's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4043">post earlier today</a> about <a href="http://www.hitsongscience.com/">Hit Song Science</a>, a piece of software that uses algorithms to analyze songs to predict their likelihood of success in the market, reminded me of a favorite imaginative bit in Jonathan Franzen's novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0312421273/ref=sib_vae_pg_345/102-8942045-9540912?%5Fencoding=UTF8&keywords=music%20software&p=S09U&twc=1&checkSum=7IOGoURCKz%2FWWLDYJ6Uz2Lv8nF0H%2BYh%2ByHrwUldWHmk%3D#reader-link">The Corrections</a></em>, which was a big hit a couple years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . Brian spent his executive afternoons noodling around with computer code . . . and writing a piece of software that in the fullness of time he quietly patented, quietly found a VC backer for, and one day, on the advice of this backer, quietly sold to the W Corporation for $19,500,000.</p>
<p>Brian's product, called Eigenmelody, processed any piece of recorded music into an eigenvector that distilled the song's tonal and melodic essence into discrete, manipulable coordinates. An Eigenmelody user could select a favorite Moby song, and Eigenmelody would spectroanalyze her choice, search a recorded-music database for songs with similar eigenvectors, and produce a list of kindred sounds that the user might otherwise have never found . . . . Eigenmelody was a parlor game, musicological tool, and record-sales-enhancer rolled into one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Franzen's fictional concept sounds more feasible and useful than Hit Song Science's, but the parallels are interesting.</p>
<p>Separate point: I remember reading Franzen's passage and thinking what an interesting dilemma for a novelist to have: If you come up with a great, compelling idea for an invention, do you pursue it in your art, or in real life?</p>
