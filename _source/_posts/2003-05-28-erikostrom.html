Today we're starting a new feature on the Creative Commons weblog: the Featured Content of the Week. Each week, we'll link to some interesting licensed content that we've found on the web. These can be single photographs, songs, movies, e-books, or even new weblogs. If you've got some interesting material you'd like to be considered for Featured Content, feel free to send the URL to your work to <a href="mailto:webmaster@creativecommons.org">this address</a>.</p>
<p>This week we're enjoying <a href="http://www.drowning.org/tracks.shtml">the folk music</a> (complete with mandolin!) of <a href="http://jfb.livejournal.com/">Erik Ostrom</a>. </p>
