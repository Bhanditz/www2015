<p>The <a href="http://www.president.bg/main.php">official website</a> of the Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov is now available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.5/bg/">Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 2.5 Bulgarian license</a>. Bulgaria's <a href="http://www.mfa.bg">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> has been releasing its material under the same license since 2006, but ordinarily, these websites would be under full copyright, explains <a href="http://cc.isoc.bg/">CC Bulgaria</a> Project Lead <span class="storyAuthor">Veni Markovski.</span></p>
<p><span class="storyAuthor">"</span>Bulgaria has taken a step in the right direction to complete its image as a country where the politicians are aware of the most advanced technologies and use them for the good of the society," Veni <span class="storyAuthor"><a href="http://blog.veni.com/?p=916">adds</a>.</span></p>
<p>Government leaders in other countries are also choosing similar paths. The Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan licenses his <a href="http://www.president.am/">official website</a> under a <a rel="license" href="../licenses/by-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license</a>, and governments in <a href="http://www.innovation.gov.au/innovationreview/Pages/home.aspx">Australia</a> and <a href="http://www.sip.gob.mx/guiafinal.pdf">Mexico</a> (pdf) use and recommend CC. Another licensing decision <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11170">already bearing fruit</a> is <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/change.gov');" href="http://change.gov/">Change.gov</a>, the website of US president-elect Barack Obamaâ€™s transition team, which is published under the most permissive of Creative Commons copyright licenses - <a href="../licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution 3.0 Unported</a>.</p>
