<p>This Thursday, August 30th, between 7PM and 9PM, we will be hosting <strong>our very first <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Los_Angeles_Salon#Presenters">CC Salon in Los Angeles</a></strong> at LAND in Little Tokyo (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=366+E+2nd+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">366 E. 2nd St</a>). The Salons are a great opportunity to meet-up with others interested in Creative Commons, technology, new media and discuss how we can all work together.</p>
<p>To say we are excited for this Salon would be an understatement - joining us will be <a href="http://jetsetshow.com/">JetSet Show</a>/<a href="http://pixelodeonfest.com/">Pixelodeon</a>, the popular vlog/Vloger Awards Conference (discussed previously <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7533">here</a>), and <a href="http://www.vosotrosmusic.com/">Vosotros Music</a>, an amazing LA-based, CC-oriented, record label. Eric Steuer, CC's Creative Director, will be rounding out the Salon with a discussion of what is happening in the world of CC in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>The fun doesn't end there though as Vosotros' monthly concert series, <a href="http://www.vosotrosmusic.com/live/">Live@Land</a>, will be taking place afterwards with some musical performances that are bound to be amazing. We've heard rumors of a beat-boxing tuba player - what more can you ask for?</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/257289/?ps=6">upcoming</a> page here - the drinks are right and the food delicious. Its going to be a great time and we can't wait to see you there.</p>
