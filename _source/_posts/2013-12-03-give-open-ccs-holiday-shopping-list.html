<p>If you're scurrying for gifts this year, consider giving open. We've put together this list of a few of our favorite openly licensed gifts. What did we miss? Add your favorites to the comments.</p>
<p><a href="http://questioncopyright.com/sita.html"><img src="img/peacock-250.jpg" width="250" height="251" align="right" border="0" style="margin-left: 10px; " /></p>
<h3><a href="http://questioncopyright.com/sita.html">Sita Sings the Blues merchandise</a></h3>
<p>Not only is <em>Sita</em> a great film, but it has some of the most unique and beautiful merchandise ever. I've actually always thought this was the success of her business model - having things people actually want to buy. I've always been particularly fond of the peacock phonograph pendant. <em>Review by Jessica Coates</em></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0615314465/creatcommo09-20/ref=nosim/">xkcd volume 0</a></h3>
<p>The first collection of the best geek comic out there. There's something for everyone in this volume, whether they're a lover, a gamer or a mathematician. There's even something for us copyright geeks, with the complete adventures of Doctorow, Lessig, et al in their complete superhero garb. <em>Review by Jessica Coates</em></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9063692595/creatcommo09-20/ref=nosim/<br />
">Open Design Now</a></h3>
<p><em><a href="http://opendesignnow.org/">Open Design Now</a></em> is been one of the most thought-provoking books I've read this year on openness. It's available for free online under a Creative Commons license or available for purchase as a hard copy. Highly recommended read for anyone interested in the intersection of open design and physical objects. <em>Review by Paul Stacey</em></p>
<p></a><a href="http://www.fabsie.com/products/this-stool-rocks"><img src="img/thisstool-250.jpg" width="250" height="350" align="left" border="0" style="margin-right: 10px; " /></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://www.fabsie.com/products/this-stool-rocks">This Stool Rocks</a></h3>
<p>Yup, it's a rocking stool. It's such an elegant innovation in design that once you see it, you wonder why it took so long for someone to think of it. If you have access to a CNC machine, you can download the CC-licensed design and build your own. <a href="http://www.fabsie.com/products/this-stool-rocks">Assmbly will make one for you</a>, and even carve your logo on the seat, but order now: there's a waiting list. <em>Review by Elliot Harmon</em></p>
<h3><a href="http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/">Cards Against Humanity</a></h3>
<p>One of the best card games out there, perfect for long nights with good friends and a bottle of whisky. Like Apples for Apples, but far more surreal and less suitable for children. Download the whole thing from their website and spend hours turning it into a neat game; or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004S8F7QM/creatcommo09-20/ref=nosim/<br />
">just shell out $25</a> and get the pretty one to begin with. Also available in Spanish, Dutch, pirate and many other languages thanks to its CC license and fan translations. <em>Review by Jessica Coates</em></p>
<h3><a href="http://phylogame.org/">Phylo</a></h3>
<p>The Phylo trading card game is a CC licensed online initiative aimed at creating a Pokemon-like resource but using photos of <em>real</em> animals and plants as a means of helping children learn about biodiversity. <em>Review by Paul Stacey</em></p>
<h3><a href="http://groupworksdeck.org/">Group Works</a></h3>
<p>Sticking with cards, I also really like the Group Works pattern cards. These are really useful for anyone who plans meetings, conferences, retreats, and other group sessions. If you are a facilitator, these cards help you plan and create meaningful events. You can download the free, CC-licensed deck or purchase one. <em>Review by Paul Stacey</em></p>

<h3><a href="http://deadunicorn.bandcamp.com/">Dead Unicorn: Pandemic</a></h3>
<p>Dead Unicorn makes melodic pop-punk music that's surprisingly fun, given their fixation on writing songs about disease. They're also the guys behind <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IywguCdoHQ">my favorite "about CC" video ever</a>. Earlier this year, the band Kickstarted <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zacshaw/dead-unicorn-pandemic-lp"><em>Pandemic</em></a> and printed a limited run on colored vinyl (they identify the color as "piss yellow.") Give it to your weird nephew who thinks you aren't cool. <em>Review by Elliot Harmon</em></p>
<h3><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/store/posters-and-prints/">Public Domain Review prints</a></h3>
<p>If you're not already following The Public Domain Review (a project of our friends at <a href="http://okfn.org/">The Open Knowledge Foundation</a>), you should be. Every day, they post a new find from the endless supply of public domain treasures and oddities. This year, the PDR launched a <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/store/">store full of public domain goodies</a> to help raise money. My favorite is the print of an 1887  woodcut designed to teach Japanese children English words. <em>Review by Elliot Harmon</em></p>
<h3><a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog3&utm_medium=blog">Team Open trading cards</a></h3>
<p>Of course we had to sneak ourselves onto this list. We worked with the webcartoonist <a href="http://www.lukesurl.com/">Luke Surl</a> on the drawings for our <a href="http://teamopen.cc/">Team Open interview project</a>. We think he perfectly captured the spirit of the subjects we interviewed. <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog3&utm_medium=blog">Everyone who donates $25 (USD) or more</a> to CC gets their own complete set of trading cards.</p>
