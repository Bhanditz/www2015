<p>Please join us for the third <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/salon">CC Salon</a> in San Francisco on Wednesday, May 10 from 6-9 PM at <a href="http://www.shinesf.com/">Shine</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1337+Mission,+sf,+ca">1337 Mission Street</a> between 8th and 9th Streets). CC Salon is a casual get-together focused on conversation, networking, and 2-3 brief presentations from individuals or groups who are developing projects with relationships to <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons.</a>  Please invite your friends, colleagues, and anyone you know who might be interested in drinks and discussion.</p>
<p>The dynamic line-up for May 10 features <a href="http://egofood.blogspot.com/">Chris DiBona</a>, the <a href="http://code.google.com/">Open Source Programs Manager for Google</a>, who will discuss Google, Creative Commons, and the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of Code</a>, of which Creative Commons is a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summer_of_Code_2006">mentoring organization</a> (applications due May 8).</p>
<p><a href="http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/">Ken Goldberg</a> (Artist and <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> Professor) and <a href="http://www.tiffanyshlain.com/">Tiffany Shlain</a> (founder of the <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/">Webby Awards</a>) are presenting their film, <a href="http://tribethefilm.com/">The Tribe</a>, an award-winning film screened at the 2006 <a href="http://festival.sundance.org/2006/">Sundance</a> and <a href="http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/">Tribeca Film Festivals.</a>  The Tribe is described as "the unorthodox, unauthorized history of the Jewish people and the Barbie doll...in about 15 minutes." Ken will also show a short video that commemorates the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake-"Ballet Mori: a ballet conducted by the Earth". In this improvisational performance, "SF Ballet Principal Dancer Muriel Maffre responded to a musical composition modulated live by the unpredictable fluctuations of the Earth's movement as measured in real-time by a UC Berkeley seismometer at the Hayward Fault."</p>
<p>Also, Abram Stern and Michael Dale from <a href="http://ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz</a> will present <a href="http://metavid.ucsc.edu">Metavid</a>, a system for the collective remediation of public government proceedings. Metavid uses Free and Open Source Software to capture public domain footage along with closed captioning to make the archive searchable.</p>
<p>Filling in the gaps throughout the CC Salon is Quarterbar, who will be spinning a CC-licensed electronic mix.</p>
