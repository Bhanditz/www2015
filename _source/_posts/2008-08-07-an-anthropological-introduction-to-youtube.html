<p>Michael Wesch, creator of the strikingly insightful videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCJ46vyR9o">"A Vision of Students Today"</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLlGopyXT_g">"The Machine is Us/ing Us"</a>, gave a <a href="http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2008/08-104.html">presentation</a> at the Library of Congress back in May on the anthropology of YouTube. The presentation was the third in a series called "Digital Natives," natives being basically my and probably your generation if you're reading this. It's about the net and the people who grew up with a computer humming by their bed stands. Wesch delves into this phenomenon that is us---how we think and how we perceive and connect with the world differently due to the internet and new media like YouTube.Â </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPAO-lZ4_hU&amp;eurl=http://educationaltechnology.ca/couros/880">"An anthropological introduction to YouTube"</a> is where "traditional" academic research and the new media landscape intersect. It is the anthropological perspective and study of our generation's fascination with YouTube, and is itself viewable on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mwesch">Wesch's YouTube page</a>.Â Check it out; I started watching it and couldn't stop. The fifty-five minutes flew by like a lunch break. The video itself is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>.</p>
