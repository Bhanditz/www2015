<p>Friends of Creative Commons,</p>
<p>As 2004 draws to a close, Creative Commons is strong. In the past two<br />
years since Creative Commons licenses have been available, we've taken<br />
our first large first steps with you--building some of the essential<br />
tools, adding critical pieces of infrastructure and assembling a vibrant<br />
community.</p>
<p>In 2004, Glenn, Larry, and the legal team made huge improvements and<br />
released version 2.0 of the main Creative Commons licenses. These new<br />
versions added many needed features while at the same time they reduced<br />
the complexity of the licenses for our users. Christine, Roland and all<br />
of the iCommons volunteers worldwide took that work, and have ported<br />
Creative Commons licenses to 12 countries. We expect to add another<br />
dozen countries early next year, and we're in conversation with more<br />
than 70.</p>
<p>We've found more than 5,000,000 pages with content and links back to our<br />
licenses. But the commons is about more than simply putting the work out<br />
there. So, Mike, Neeru, Matt, and Nutch.org have collaborated to develop<br />
and debut a metadata search engine that makes it easy to find content<br />
marked with Creative Commons licenses. As if that were not enough, that<br />
search functionality now ships with the amazing Firefox browser from<br />
mozilla.org.</p>
<p>Neeru and the tech team have also worked with other software developers<br />
to make it easy to integrate Creative Commons licenses. The list is<br />
long, and includes Flickr, Moveable Type, Squarespace, Manila,<br />
Archive.org, WinkSite, plus DMusic, Soundclick, Garageband.com, and<br />
others I'm sure I've forgotten.</p>
<p>We're nearer to making worry-free sampling and re-creativity mainstream.<br />
What better place to start than the cover of WIRED magazine? The WIRED<br />
CD contains sixteen sampling-friendly tunes -- and includes the Beastie<br />
Boys, David Byrne, Gilberto Gil, Chuck D and more.</p>
<p>In 2005 we will continue to build our worldwide community of<br />
contributors to free culture. We will continue to enable more images,<br />
music, films and text, and we'll start to work on the Science Commons.<br />
We'll have much more to tell you about it at the start of the year.</p>
<p>ou can help make Creative Commons and "some rights reserved" household<br />
phrases. Visit <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">http://creativecommons.org/support/</a> and you'll find out<br />
how you can make your contribution via PayPal, Amazon's Honor<br />
