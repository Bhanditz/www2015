<p>After finishing at USC music department and working with electronic superstar BT, Brian Trifon joined his brother Laurence to enter <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>'s first remix contest with a one-off band they called <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/trifonic/profile">Trifonic</a>. Their entry <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/trifonic/445">Bored on Your Backside</a> went on to be the top vote getter in the contest and album opener for the WIRED remix CD. As Trifonic they entered two more contests at ccMixter - and won <i>both</i> of those placing <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/trifonic/2181">Stranger from Below</a> on Magnatune's <i><a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/debenedictis-mixterone/hifi_play">Lisa Debendictis: Mixter One</a></i> album and <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/trifonic/4163">The Next Step</a> in the <i><a href="http://www.copyrightcriminals.com/">Copyright Criminals</a></i> movie.</p>
<p>Then Hollywood started calling and their music was getting licensed all over including for TV shows such as CSI. </p>
<p>Spurred by their success on ccMixter they decided to make it official and collaborated with songwriters and singers to create their aptly named debut album <i><a href="http://www.trifonic.com/music">Emergence</a></i> and in a very generous gesture back to the Commons have released the solo tracks, including the a cappellas into the Commons under a BY-NC license for sharing and remixing. You can download the tracks <a href="http://ccmixter.org/trifonic">from ccMixter</a>.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the community at ccMixter for all the inspiring remixes and support!" says Brian. "We wouldnâ€™t be here without ccMixterâ€¦ seriously, that was our first real step as Trifonic."
