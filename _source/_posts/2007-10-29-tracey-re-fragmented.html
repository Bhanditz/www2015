<p><a href="http://www.thetraceyfragments.com/"><em>The Tracey Fragments</em></a>, the latest film from Canadian director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_McDonald">Bruce McDonald</a>, follows the story of a 15-year-old girl (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983/">Ellen Page</a>) who has "lost her little brother and sets out on a desperate journey to find him". While the film itself <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0jEN2_REy4">looks absolutely phenomenal</a>, <em>Tracey: Re-Fragmented</em>, the film's online counterpart, is where the project really begins to take shape for those in the CC-community. From The Tracey Fragments: </p>
<blockquote><p>Tracey: Re-Fragmented makes available at www.traceyfragments.com all the footage from the shoot of the film for users to download and re-edit their own related projects including music videos, new trailers or to re-edit the entire movie themselves. The <strong>Creative Commons licensed initiative</strong> also makes available the score of the movie by Indie Collective Broken Social Scene. </p>
<p>Director Bruce McDonald explains the inspiration behind the project: â€œThe Tracey Fragments is a film that fully embraces experimentation and teamwork.  I wanted to find out if that experience exists on the Internet and give others the chance to experiment and play with some beautifully shot footage of a world class actress in a free form environment. I hope people make their own feature films, short films, rock videos, trailers, experimental films and personal manifestos out of The Tracey Fragments.â€ </p></blockquote>
<p>McDonald's decision to embrace CC-licensing for <em>The Tracey Fragments</em> is remarkable in both practice and scope. Fans can choose to do what they will with the massive amount of assets provided ( under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">BY-NC-SA licence</a>), interpreting and re-envisioning the the film and its subject material in what is bound to be a variety of ways. By putting the film's assets in the hands of would-be-editors and film-makers under CC-licences, <em>Tracey: Re-Fragmented</em> recognizes and embraces the concept of a hybrid economy, allowing people to experiment freely with the content around them while retaining the film's commercial interests.</p>
<p><em>The Tracey Fragments</em> already represents a fascinating foray into unique narrative and filmic techniques (specifically multi-frame editing) and <em>Tracey: Re-Fragmented</em> continues that experimental nature into the realm of content licensing. It should be noted that <em>Re-Fragmented</em> also functions as a contest in which the winner will receive a Tracey/Final Cut prize package, the details of which can be found at the "Re-Fragmented" section at the <a href="http://www.thetraceyfragments.com/">"Tracey website</a>. <em>The Tracey Fragments</em> has its US premier at the AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles on Nov. 6th at 6:45. You can find other select screening times at the <a href="http://thetraceyfragments.blogspot.com/"><em>Tracey Fragments</em> blog</a>.</p>
