<p>Prominent Free Culture activist, <a href="http://roflcon.org/">ROFLCon-ite</a>, and close CC friend Dean Jansen <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/blog/2008/07/uploading-to-archiveorg-just-got-easy/">blogged recently</a> about Archive.org's new absolutely amazingly easy-to-use <a href="http://www.archive.org/create/">new interface</a> for uploading media. As he writes,</p>
<p><em>This is great news, as Archive.org has historically been notoriously difficult to publish to. Iâ€™m encouraging them to go one step further and add easily accessible RSS links (with media enclosures) for users, categories, searches and so forth. This will turn Archive.org into an amazing free 1-stop (non-profit) publishing platform for independent podcasters and video bloggers alike.</em></p>
<p>Very cool. It currently only works for things less than 100 MB, and for anything larger, there's the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher">Creative Commons Publisher Tool</a>. Check it out!</p>
