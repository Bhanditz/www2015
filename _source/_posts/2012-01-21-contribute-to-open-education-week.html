<p>Join your colleagues around the world to increase understanding about open education! <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org"><strong>Open Education Week</strong></a> will take place from <strong>5-10 March 2012</strong> online and in locally hosted events around the world. The objective is to raise awareness of the open education movement and open educational resources. There are several ways you and your organization can be involved:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Provide a pre-recorded informational virtual tour of your project, work, or organization. This should be focused on the work youâ€™re doing in open education, designed for a general audience. These can be done in any language.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Offer a webinar. Webinars are well suited for topics of general interest, such as whatâ€™s happening in open education in a particular area or country, or topics that offer discussion possibilities. Webinars can be scheduled in any language, 24 hours a day. Organizers would also like to feature question and answer sessions in a variety of languages and time zones.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Pre-record a presentation on open education concepts. Do you have an inspiring presentation about open education? Can you discuss the issues that open education seeks to address in your country, region or globally? Organizers plan to feature short, introductory overviews of open education and OER for different audiences, such as those new to the idea, policy makers, faculty, etc. Presentations in any language are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Create or share text-based, downloadable information. This should be information on the open education movement, in any language, appropriate to introduce the movement and its important concepts to a variety of audiences. Specific information on your project can be linked to from the <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org">open education week</a> website.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Sponsor or host a local event during the week of 5-10 March. This could be a community discussions, a forum on open education, a challenge and/or a celebration.
