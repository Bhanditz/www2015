<p>As we all know, Creative Commons offers free license and tech tools to the creators for them to use to clearly signal to the public that some uses are permitted.  But CC is also about more than just the actual licenses and tools â€” CC and the issues it raises and touches on engenders debate.  We have tried to collate some of the more significant comments by, about and against CC at this <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcDebate">ccDebate</a> page on our wiki.  As you can see, there was certainly no dearth of criticisms from a variety of different sectors in 2005 & in 2006, the discussion continues. If you think something should be included here that we've omitted, please <a href="mailto:info@creativecommons.org">email</a> us & let us know. Many thanks to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#59">Amy</a> who put this together!</p>
