<p><a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2009/05/28/legacy-rb-prodigys-self-titled-album-free-on-frostwire-under-creative-commons/"><img src="img/legacy_screengrab-300x214.png" alt="legacy_screengrab" title="legacy_screengrab" width="300" height="214" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-14834" /></a><a href="http://www.frostwire.com">FrostWire</a> has been quietly promoting Creative Commons licensed musicians and content on the front page of their Bit Torrent and Gnutella client for quite a while now. Previous featured CC artists include <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2009/02/10/the-newest-collection-of-house-music-from-espsix-free-via-frostwire/">ESPSIX</a>, <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2008/12/28/mike-falzones-album-fun-with-honesty-free-via-frostwire/">Mike Falzone</a>, and CC veteran <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2009/03/17/brad-sucks-newest-album-out-of-it-on-p2p-via-frostwire/">Brad Sucks</a>.</p>
<p>Today the team announced that another up and coming artist,  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/legacymusicpage">Danny "Legacy" Mcbride</a>, is releasing his new album under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NoDerivatives</a> license so he can be featured on FrostWire. This was a smart choice for Legacy (and all of the highlighted musicians) as FrostWire boasts millions of active users which helps them garner substantial exposure they might not otherwise would have received.</p>
<p>Kudos to FrostWire for taking the proactive step of encouraging legal filesharing with CC in an otherwise murky climate. Check out the <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/">FrostClick blog</a> for more featured artists and downloads.</p>
