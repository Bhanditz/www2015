<p>The <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/resources/publications/fair_use_in_online_video/">Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Online Video</a> is a stellar resource for online video creators looking to better understand their fair use rights. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8460">Previously released</a> as a PDF-download by American University's <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/">Center for Social Media</a>, the document now has a fitting video counterpart titled <em><a href="http://blip.tv/file/2081224">Remix Culture: Fair Use Is Your Friend</a></em>.

<blockquote><p>"This video lets people know about the code, an essential creative tool, in the natural language of online video. The code protects this emerging zone from censorship and self-censorship," said Aufderheide, director of the Center for Social Media and a professor in AU's School of Communication. "Creators, online video providers, and copyright holders will be able to know when copying is stealing and when it's legal."</p></blockquote>
