<p>Super cool video conversation site <a href="http://seesmic.com">Seesmic</a> just rolled out its most requested feature today, <a href="http://blog.seesmic.com/2008/07/seesmic-update.html">Creative Commons licensing of course</a>! Seesmic <a href="http://blog.seesmic.com/2008/07/seesmic-update.html">added all 6 primary licenses</a> as option and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC Attribution 3.0</a> as default license for videos uploaded. "This means you determine how other people can use your content.  Your choices are now between six combinations of Creative Commons licenses, and "All Rights Reserved," says <a href="http://blog.seesmic.com/2008/07/seesmic-update.html">Jeremy Vaught from Seesmic</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/07/16/seesmic-and-cre.html">Joi already beat me to the punch in blogging</a> about this and posted up a video. If you <a href="http://rejon.org/2008/07/16/seesmic-adds-cc-licensing/">head over to my site</a> or Joi's and you can see also the video that Loic shot with me at the CC office in San Francisco yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>And, if you head over to <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/#/video/Vr5N4m4bZU/watch">Seesmic's main page right now</a>, they have a community video discussion with a fair use and copyright expert (~3:30 PM PST).</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabulousbitches.org/">Tim "ROFLcon" Hwang</a> and I have been working with Seesmic to add this over the last few weeks and they rocked it out pretty quick! Joanne and Loic followed up with me noting where they added CC support, which is cool for others in similar position to note as well because Seesmic relies heavily at present on Flash video (like Youtube and others) and Flash-based interface elements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Either logged in or out you see a link where it says's Some Rights Reserved at <a href="http://www.seesmic.com">www.seesmic.com</a></li>
<li>When a community member goes to post a video there is a small icon that defaults to the Attribution license, but one may click, scroll down to see the other license options and learn more.</li>
<li>Community members also access CC on their profile page and in the embeddable player, where the license option links out to the selected CC license deed page.</li>
<li>You can read more about our announcement at <a href="http://blog.seesmic.com/">http://blog.seesmic.com/</a>.
</li>
<li>Also added to CC our Terms of Service (ToS) with links to CC's site where appropriate: <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/docs/TOS.html">http://www.seesmic.com/docs/TOS.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p><small>As such, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL">IANAL</a>, and CC doesn't provide legal support. These are just notes on how Seesmic has integrated CC licensing. </small>
</p></blockquote>
<p>CC integration should be rewarded with traffic, right! Head on over there and start posting videos. Oh, and if you want to know the verb form of Seesmic, its to Seesmic.</p>
