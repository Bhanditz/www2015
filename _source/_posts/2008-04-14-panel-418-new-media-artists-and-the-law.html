<p>This Friday, April 18, at 7PM CC's Creative Director <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#50">Eric Steuer</a> will be speaking on a panel titled <a href="http://cla04182008-emailinvite.eventbrite.com/">New Media Artists and the Law</a> at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=60%20South%20Market%20Street,+San%20Jose,+CA++United%20States&amp;hl=en">The Kirsch Conference Center</a> in San Jose, CA. Hosted by <a href="http://www.calawyersforthearts.org/">California Lawyers for the Arts</a>, Eric will be joined by <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/emily">Emily A. Berger</a>, Intellectual Property Fellow with <a href="eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, and <a href="http://cadre.sjsu.edu/people/joel/">Joel Slayton</a>, Director of the CADRE Laboratory for New Media, for a discussion of "the ways copyright laws are implicated in new media art and the challenges artists face in this evolving area of the law."</p>
<p>The panel promises to be quite fascinating, with topics including "derivative works, best practices, defensible positions, reproduction and public display rights and the Internet, peer-to-peer file sharing, streaming, [and] fair use". With three diverse backgrounds on hand, these issues will diverge and converge in unexpected ways that are bound to prove enlightening. All relative information below:</p>
