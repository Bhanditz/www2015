<p>So we at CC love to watch Flickr. We love to watch <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons">the number of CC-licensed images</a> grow and grow...We love to check out recent images that are posted to Flickr from people in different places about the things that they are witnessing on a day to day level - whether it's the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wilbanks/71857448/">snowstorms on the East Coast of the US</a>, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/burningman/">latest Burning Man</a> or more serious events such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/hurricanekatrina/">the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina</a> or the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/londonbombings/">London bombings</a>. The photos uploaded to Flickr in many ways reflect the different daily zeitgeists in different parts of the globe. So we're thrilled to learn that our Creative Commons' t-shirts are Flickr worthy and becoming part of the daily Flickr zeitgeist. And, of course, these photos are CC-licensed.</p>
