<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7310">recently promised</a> we've added an exciting new CC-enabled search service to <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://spinxpress.com/getmedia">SpinXpress Get Media</a> searches the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>'s massive audio and video collections as well as media at several other sites, including Magnatune, Flickr, and blip.tv and allows filtering searches by desired source, media type, and license.</p>
<p>We're extremely pleased that the Internet Archive's collections are now easily searchable via <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">search.creativecommons.org</a>, as archive.org has been an important supporter of Creative Commons works from the beginning (check out <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher">ccPublisher</a> for a cross plaform desktop application that helps you license and take advantage of archive.org hosting for your media).</p>
<p>Jay Dedman of SpinXpress will be at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7388">Wednesday's CC Salon San Francisco</a> to present about CC integration with Get Media and other SpinXpress applications.</p>
