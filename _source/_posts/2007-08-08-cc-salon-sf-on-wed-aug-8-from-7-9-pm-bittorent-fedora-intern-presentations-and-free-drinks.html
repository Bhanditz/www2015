<p>Tonight we are back at <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/199764">Shine</a> with what has become an absolutely awesome <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC Salon</a>. Think of it not only as a way to see some fantastic presentations (<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">Bittorent</a> Pres. Ashwin Navin, Jack Aboutboul, community engineer for <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> at Red Hat, + Interns) but also as a way to celebrate the release of our brand new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/project/livecontent">LiveContent</a> project.</p>
<p>There will be <strong><em>free drinks</em></strong> (courtesy of Fedora) and some great music delivered by Quibitsu (SECRET: he is an <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>-er). Be sure to check out the awesome flier below, hand crafted by our very own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#78">Rebecca Rojer</a>.</p>
<p>Did we mention <em><strong>free drinks</strong></em>? Its going to be a party. We'll see you there!</p>
