<p>The Open Source engine that powers<br />
<a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter.org</a> and the upcoming<br />
<a href="http://openclipart.org/cchost">Open Clip Art Library infrastructure</a><br />
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost_Press_Release_3.0">received a<br />
major feature release today</a>. Part of the 3.0 release are native forums,<br />
multi-language support, e-mail notifications, support for XSPF 1.0, amongst<br />
several other wonderful features and bug fixes.</p>
<p>ccHost is a great Open Source project for new and old developers. Please visit<br />
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/cchost">ccHost's wiki</a> in order<br />
to learn more about the software, and see how to get involved.</p>
<p>The ccHost community's development plans are ramping up now as there are<br />
several new projects adopting and planning to use this software. Now is the<br />
time to plug into this community in order to help shape its direction so that<br />
you can help your community to legally share the media of your choice through<br />
ccHost and the Creative Commons' licenses.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b>: We found a bug and so patched this release. Please visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&package_id=156675&release_id=446012">this page to get the updated ccHost 3.0.1</a>.</p>
