<p>To complement the long term collaboration embodied in a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/5761">wiki</a> and the measured conversation (at times) on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss">mailing lists</a> we've set up a real time Internet Relay Chat channel, <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/cc">#cc on freenode</a> (link will only work if you have an IRC client like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatZilla">ChatZilla</a> installed).</p>
<p>Like our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org">wiki</a>, the IRC channel is primarily indended as a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer">software developer</a> resource, but feel free to stop by and say hi or ask and answer questions regardless.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#53">Jon Phillips</a> for setting up a 'bot' which helpfully logs wiki changes and software commits to the channel and especially to <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a> for providing such a valuable service to the community.</p>
