<p>What better gift for your dad on Father&#39;s Day but a remix of his favorite videos?</p>
<p><strong>YouTube launches support for CC BY and a CC library featuring 10,000 videos</strong></p>
<p>You <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/06/01/youtube-introduces-c.html">heard</a> the great news last week&mdash;YouTube added the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1106&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> (CC BY) as a licensing option for users! Now when users upload video, they can choose to license it under CC BY or to remain with the default &ldquo;Standard YouTube License.&rdquo; Users may also change the license on existing videos by editing each video individually.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the implementation, YouTube also launched a Creative Commons video library containing 10,000 initial videos under CC BY from organizations such as C-SPAN, PublicResource.org, Voice of America, and Al Jazeera. The library serves as a base catalog of videos for users to access, edit, and incorporate into their own video projects. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/editor">YouTube Video Editor</a> now contains a CC tab that allows users to search the Creative Commons video library and select videos to edit and remix. Users may remix videos directly on the editor platform, and any video that is created using CC BY-licensed content will automatically display the linked titles of the source videos underneath the player. Since CC BY is enabled as a licensing option, the library will grow as more users choose to license their work under CC BY. Already, in less than a week, the number of CC BY-licensed videos on YouTube has grown to more than 60,000.
