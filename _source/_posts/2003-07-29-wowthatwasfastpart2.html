<p>On Saturday, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3774">we posted about</a> the Creative Commons licensing used by Scott Andrew and Shannon Campbell on their collaborative music project. They ended up creating <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/blogathon/#785">two songs</a> by Sunday morning and released them under a license.</p>
<p>Late Sunday night, <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/main/2003_07#a000787">Scott posted a link</a> to the first derivative work made from it, <a href="http://www.drowning.org/petrockstars.shtml">a re-recording</a> by previously featured content of the week singer/songwriter <a href="http://www.drowning.org">Erik Ostrom</a> (using <em>none</em> of the same instruments that Scott and Shannon used, no less).</p>
