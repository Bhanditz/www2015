<p><a href="http://www.insecuritymovie.com/index.php"><em>Insecurity</em></a> is "an Australian-made independently-funded feature film" with a 'hacker' plot line at its core.  As "everyone involved in [<em>Insecurity</em>'s] creation are, to one degree or another, involved in the IT industry or some other nerd subculture", the film aims to be as technically accurate as possible. Released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND licence</a>, you can <a href="http://www.insecuritymovie.com/stream.php">stream the film live</a> or download it for free <a href="http://www.insecuritymovie.com/download.php">here</a>. From <em>Insecurity</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When offered four thousand dollars to break into a computer network, Leon (Peter Love) and Greg (Kurtis Wakefield) aren't concerned with something as petty as morality.</p>
<p>The only real questions are what complications can arise from hacking into a small home business, what's wrong with the twenty year old daughter Madison (Zoe Tarling)...</p>
<p>... and what should Greg do when his friend can't stop watching the girl on her own webcam - and without her knowledge.</p></blockquote>
