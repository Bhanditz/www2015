<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPA">CCPA</a> is a small group that meets semi-regularly in San Francisco to discuss questions about CC licensing and to establish best practices for publishers and others using Creative Commons' legal tools. <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/">TechSoup</a>'s Amit Asaravala was kind enough to put together a set of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPA">notes</a> that outline the most recent CCPA meeting's questions and answers. Since many of these questions are ones that we here at CC are asked frequently, we're posting the notes to our wiki, so that others may benefit from the discussion, as well as add their own thoughts and questions.</p>
