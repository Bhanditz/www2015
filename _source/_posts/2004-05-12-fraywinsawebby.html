A hearty congratulations goes out to <a href="http://www.fray.com/">The Fray</a> for <a href="http://fray.com/storyblog/2004/05/12/000544.shtml">winning a webby</a> this year. The Fray is an online storytelling site where contributors share tales and allow for comment by readers afterwards. There are also live events held several times a year where folks gather to tell stories on stage, <a href="http://www.fray.com/events/audio/">all the audio</a> of which is available under a Creative Commons license.</p>
