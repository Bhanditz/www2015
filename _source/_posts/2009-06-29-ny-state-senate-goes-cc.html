<p>If you're reading the Creative Commons blog, chances are you're aware of the fact that the United States federal government is not entitled to copyright protection for their works. If you didn't know this, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government">the Wikipedia article on the subject</a>, or some of our past <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14237">blog</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12267">posts</a> on the subject. This means that federal works are essentially in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>.</p>
<p>What you may not know is that works of American states, in contrast to works of the federal government, <a href="http://www.cendi.gov/publications/04-8copyright.html#313">are actually entitled to copyright protection under U.S. law</a>. This creates the very awkward consequence of states automatically holding copyright in <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/about/about_news_09-03-08.htm">the very state laws, rules and court decisions that bind their citizens, not to mention other types of content created by its employees who are paid from public coffers filled in part by their taxpayers</a>.  CC is not alone (check out legendary archivist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud">Carl Malamud</a> and his <a href="http://public.resource.org">public.resource.org</a> project for more info) in believing that all such works should belong to the public and reside in the public domain. </p>
<p>Needless to say, we think this is an enormous opportunity for proper application of our legal tools to free up state works.</p>
<p><img src="img/New_York_State_Senate_Logo.png" class="alignleft" />This is why its exciting to see the <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/">New York State Senate</a> adopt <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/copyright-policy">a Creative Commons License for the content on their website</a>. The photos and text of NYSenate.gov are now available under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives</a> license, and 3rd party content, such as comments and user submitted photos are available under our Attribution license. Furthermore, the Senate has used our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+ protocol</a> to allow all other uses (even commercial ones and non-attribution ones) <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/copyright-policy">of the content so long as it is not for political fund raising purposes</a>.  In other words, if you're not doing political fund raising you're allowed to do whatever you want with the content.</p>
<p>While this is a somewhat novel approach to using our licenses, and indeed grants citizens rights to works they don't currently have, it is only the first step. In the future, CC would love to see more states pushing their work into the public domain (and their policies into synchronicity with those of the federal government), for example by using our public domain waiver, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a>.</p>
<p>If you know of a state using CC licenses, add it to our wiki page on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Government_use_of_CC_licenses">government uses of CC</a>, or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contact">just let us know</a>.</p>
