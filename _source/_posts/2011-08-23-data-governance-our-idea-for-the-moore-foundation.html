<p>The Moore Foundation has <a href="http://dis.ideascale.com/">called for community feedback</a> on where to invest in the area of data-intensive science. We've submitted our own idea -- <a href="http://dis.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Data-Governance/40583-14743">data governance</a> -- and would love your feedback and support for the idea. We have been exploring data governance issues, including data licensing, since 2004 in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/science">science</a> work, and we're planning to make data governance a priority across the Creative Commons organization going forward.</p>
<p><a href="http://dis.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Data-Governance/40583-14743">Data governance</a> is more than just licensing. It's the system of decision rights and accountabilities for data-related processes that describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances and using what methods. Our work on the <a href="http://neurocommons.org/">Neurocommons</a> project -- using web standards to mark up copyright licenses and developing technological infrastructure to make the commons searchable and usable -- all inform our ideas on data governance.</p>
<p>We are actively planning for a major project in data in 2012, and look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas. Please register and vote, and not just on <a href="http://dis.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Data-Governance/40583-14743">our idea</a> -- participation in processes like this is a great way to increase their usage by foundations in making funding choices that can benefit the commons. </p>
