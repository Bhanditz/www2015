<p>Last Friday was the last day of Creative Commons' fourth summer internship program. The staff had the pleasure of working with six accomplished students from various backgrounds and locations. As seen in their active blogging and outreach, they proved to be an asset during our busy summer months. We'd like to thank them each for their diligence at the office and exuberance for free culture.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freedomforip.org/">Brian Rowe</a>, a 3L from the University of Seattle School of Law, was our Legal intern.  </li>
<li><a href="http://www.franktobia.com/">Frank Tobia</a>, from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Technology, was a Tech intern. </li>
<li>Grace Armstrong, who is attending Yale University in the fall, assisted our ccLearn team.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.grossmeier.net/">Greg Grossmeier</a>, a graduate student from the University Michigan School of Information, was our Community Development intern. </li>
<li>Steren Giannini, from Ecole Centrale de Lyon in France, was our other Technology intern.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fabulousbitches.org/">Tim Hwang</a>, from Harvard University, was the Business Development intern. </li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian for helping to distill the much needed list of "<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ">Frequently Frequently Asked Questions</a>;" </li>
<li>Frank for improving the <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit?p=currybot.git;a=summary">curry bot</a> and working on code that will reduce the duplicated code in our licensing interfaces;</li>
<li>Grace for bringing an inquisitive eye to the international issues in the realm of ccLearn and open education;</li>
<li>Greg for driving <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Casestudies">Case Studies</a>, PDregistry.ca and ccHost 5 forward with his mad bug reporting and triaging skills;</li>
<li>Steren for improving our internal task tracking system and making the deeds and license chooser validate as XHTML+RDFa;</li>
<li>and thanks to Tim for all his hard work on the Case Studies and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics">Metrics</a> projects and for helping plan the next wave of CC business development.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were truly impressed by all your <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/greg.g/final-presentation-creative-commons-internship-presentation/">great work</a>, and look forward to seeing each of you again in the near future!</p>
