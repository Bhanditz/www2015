<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire"><img alt="" src="img/200px-Lancashire_flag.png" class="alignleft" width="200" height="121" /></a>The digital arts organization <a href="http://www.folly.co.uk">folly</a> has joined forces <a href="http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/">Lancashire County Council</a> to commission art for the cities, towns, and villages of the Northwest England county. From the call for proposals:</p>
<blockquote><p>This â€œDigital Engagement Commissionâ€ will question the role of digital arts and its meaning and benefits for audiences in Lancashire â€“ people who live or work in the county, visitors and those who have an interest in engaging with it virtually.</p>
<p>... The artist will make the consultation process publicly visible in an engaging and creative online platform. The participatory consultation activities should take the form of both unique and engaging physical sessions and virtual engagement via the publicly accessible online platform. This platform could be developed especially by the artist or could make use of existing social networks. Any software developed for the project would be licensed <strong>under the latest general public license and any other works developed as part of the project would be licensed under creative commons attributions share alike</strong>. (emphasis added) </p></blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of more details to the commission, so be sure to read <a href="http://www.folly.co.uk/node/1343">the whole call for proposals</a>. <em>(via <a href="http://rhizome.org/announce/view/52610">Rhizome.org</a>)</em></p>
