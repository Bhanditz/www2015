<p>Superblogger Rober Scoble recently took a ton of photos of famous people at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland and <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/31/putting-photos-into-public-domain/">released the photos into the public domain</a>, along with all of his other photos posted on Flickr. (Note that Flickr's most liberal license option is CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Attribution</a>, so that's what he's chosen there.)</p>
<p>Of course the photos immediately started being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_L._Stephenson">used in Wikipedia articles</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a recent Scoble photo, not from Davos, but <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8011">another recent event</a> (coverage in the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/01/MNNBUP4BB.DTL">San Francisco Chronicle</a>):</p>
