<p>Creative Commons is extremely pleased to welcome Virginia Rutledge as Vice President and General Counsel. This is an extraordinary hire. One press release quote, from William Patry, Senior Copyright Counsel at Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>I applaud Creative Commons for its inspired choice of Virginia Rutledge as Vice President and General Counsel. Virginiaâ€™s background in academia, the art world, and the white-shoe corporate law firm environment is unique. Her ability to forge consensus, her love of learning and commitment to the public interest will serve Creative Commons and the rest of us exceedingly well.</p></blockquote>
