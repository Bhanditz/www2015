<p>Thank you to all the internship applicants. It's past the March 13 deadline, and we have more than enough submissions to review. We will not be able to interview all applicants. We will announce our final decisions by the end of this month or early April. Applicants may email inquiries to me, Jennifer Yip. (No phone calls, please.)</p>
