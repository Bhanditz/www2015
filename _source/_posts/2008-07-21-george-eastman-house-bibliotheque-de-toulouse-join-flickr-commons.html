<p>Two more amazing photo collections have been added to the continuously growing <a href="http://flickr.com/commons">Flickr Commons</a>, one coming from the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/george_eastman_house/">George Eastman House</a> and the other from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bibliothequedetoulouse/">Le BibliothÃ¨que de Toulouse</a>. Both groups' photostreams are absolutely amazing to pour over, offering stunning images from the turn of the century that are all released in the public domain. Again, in case you have missed any of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8190">our</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8381">other</a> posts on the Flickr Commons, some info below:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The key goals of The Commons are to firstly give you a taste of the hidden treasures in the worldâ€™s public photography archives, and secondly to show how your input and knowledge can help make these collections even richer. Youâ€™re invited to help describe the photographs you discover in The Commons on Flickr, either by adding tags or leaving comments</p></blockquote>
