<p>Last week was a little like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087755/">The Muppets Take Manhattan</a>, only with cameos by Gilberto Gil and David Byrne instead of Liza Manelli and Ed Koch. Converging from as far as Berlin, Portland, San Francisco, and Tokyo, the Creative Commons team ran wild in the streets of New York, leaving us little time to explain our exploits on our site. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but in any case we'd like to share some of our experiences with you here soon. Stay tuned . . . </p>
