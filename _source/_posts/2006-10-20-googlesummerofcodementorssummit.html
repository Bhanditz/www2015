<p>I participated in <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/ospowiki/MentorSummit-2006">Google's excellent Summer of Code Mentor Summit</a> last weekend and must send yet another big thank you across the blogosphere to Google for their support of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6071">our three successful Summer of Code sponsorships</a>. Overall, last Saturday helped to forge the future of the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> project and to <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-summer-of-code-mentor-summit.html">give everyone time to meet</a> and informally form the future of Open Source.</p>
<p>Also, to all developers out there, the <a href="http://developer.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons Developer Community</a> still has many <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges">Developer Challenges</a> still. It is never too late to jump into helping out because it is pretty much proven now that dedicated Open Source developers get rewarded in multiple ways.</p>
