<p>At the beginning of this year weÂ <a href="../weblog/entry/20329">announced a revised approach</a> to our education plans, focusing our activities to support of the Open  Educational Resources (OER) movement. In order to do so we have worked  hard to increase the amount of information available on our own site â€“  in addition to a newÂ <a href="../education">Education landing page</a> and ourÂ <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_and_Open_Educational_Resources">OER portal</a> explaining Creative Commonsâ€™ role as legal and technical infrastructure  supporting OER, we have been conducting a series of interviews to help  clarify some of the challenges and opportunities of OER in todayâ€™s  education landscape.</p>
<p>One major venue for the advancement of OER is through policy change  at the local, state, federal, and international levels. We recently had  the chance to talk to Christine Mytko, who is advancing OER at the local levels through her work as a K-12 educator and the lead science reviewer at <a href="http://curriki.org/">Curriki</a>. As a teacher, Christine brings a unique perspective to the conversation around open education and policy, and gives us important insight into how teachers on the ground are thinking about copyright and using Creative Commons and OER.</p>
<p><strong>You are a teacher and the lead science reviewer at Curriki, which is known as the â€œnext generation wikiâ€ for K-12 education. Can you briefly describe who you are, your current roles, and what led to them? What would you say is Curriki's mission, and how is it helping teachers like yourself?</strong></p>
<p>For most of my teaching career, I have been a middle school science teacher in public schools. When I moved to the Bay Area three years ago, I was fortunate to find a job that combines both of my passions â€“Â  science and technology. I currently serve as the K â€“ 5 science specialist and middle school technology teacher at a small independent school in Berkeley, CA.</p>
<p>In 2007, I interviewed for part-time work at Curriki. Like many teachers, I was looking to supplement my income. What I found was a community of educators committed to creating, collaborating on, and sharing open-source materials. As part of the Curriki Review Team, I am responsible for reviewing submitted science materials and providing a public score and feedback for the contributor. I also help out with other projects as needed. Currently, I am working with another Bay Area Chemistry teacher to revise and submit an open source Chemistry digital textbook as part of the California Learning Resource Networkâ€™s <a href="http://www.clrn.org/fdti/">Free Digital Textbook Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>As stated on its main page, Curriki's mission is to â€œprovide free, high-quality curricula and education resources to teachers, students and parents around the world.â€Â  Its name, somewhat recognizably, is a play on the words â€œcurriculumâ€ and â€œwiki.â€ The Curriki repository does have many curriculum options, from lesson plans to full courses, available in various subject areas, educational levels, and languages. Curriki offers other resources, too, including textbooks, multimedia, and opportunities for community and collaborative groups.</p>
<p><strong>All Curriki content is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY), planting it firmly in the OER space. Do you know why Curriki chose CC BY for all of its materials? If not, what do you see CC BY enabling that other licenses or "all-rights-reserved" content might not?</strong></p>
<p>Contributors of Curriki content do have the option to select either public domain or a variety of CC licensing, but the default License Deed is CC-BY. I honestly donâ€™t know specifically why Curriki chose this, but I must say it as an excellent decision. CC-BY gives educators the power to remix, share and distribute materials as needed to be timely and maximally relevant to their own curriculum.</p>
<p>The flexibility afforded by a CC-BY license allows for materials to be adapted quickly. I hear that a typical textbook revision works on a 7-year cycle. Curriki materials can be updated and â€œpublishedâ€ in a matter of seconds and the community can correct any content errors just as quickly. Many topics, especially in science and technology, are changing so quickly that education can no longer afford to wait for proprietary materials to go through their lengthy cycles of publication.</p>
<p>Currently, California and Texas are the biggest purchasers of traditional â€œall-rights reservedâ€ textbooks, and publishers strive to meet these statesâ€™ requirements. Educators in other states (and countries) are forced to work within these proprietary constraints. However, OER [initiatives] such as Curriki allow teachers to freely adapt materials to best fit their pedagogical and cultural needs. Furthermore, by creating or uploading such materials onto a public repository, teachers will no longer need to work in isolation, continuously â€œre-inventing the wheel.â€Â  As relevant materials are freely shared among communities of educators, individual time spent on adapting proprietary materials will decrease, allowing educators to spend more of their precious time on other important areas of teaching.</p>
<p><strong>Describe a class- or school-wide project where you have integrated CC licensing and/or OER. What challenges have you or your students come across while searching for or using resources on the web? How would you translate this experience for teachers looking to mark up their own resources correctly for OER search and discovery? What do teachers need to know?</strong></p>
<p>In my technology classes, I now require all incorporated media to be Creative Commons, Public Domain or No Copyright. At first, after having free rein in Google Images for years, my students felt very limited in their choices. But after discussing the reasons behind copyright and copyright alternatives, many students understood the importance of respecting rights reserved.</p>
<p>There are so many excellent resources to help teachers and students use Creative Commons in their classrooms. The Creative Commons search page, Wikimedia Commons, Flickr CC group, and Google Advanced Search all are wonderful tools for finding alternatively copyrighted images. Websites such as Jamendo are great for finding CC music.</p>
<p>The language was a challenge at first for my middle school students. Although there are only six main CC licenses, my students got bogged down with terms such as â€œAttributionâ€ and â€œNo Derivatives.â€Â  It didnâ€™t help that Google uses slightly different terminology (â€œreuseâ€ and â€œreuse with modificationâ€) in their license search filter. But the kids quickly became comfortable with the terms and procedures and, within a few class periods, they easily accessed and properly used â€œsome rights reservedâ€ media. Of course, I have the kids assign rights to their own work, which reinforces the licenses, and gives students the opportunity to think carefully about which rights are important to them.</p>
<p>As far as marking up my own resources for OER search and discovery, I am still learning about the process myself. In fact, prior to my work with Curriki, I was hesitant to â€œreleaseâ€ my work as open source. I had put so much time and effort into certain materials, I didnâ€™t see the point of just giving them away on the Internet. However, the last few years, I have come to recognize the benefits of open source materials and have begun to post some of my formally guarded resources on Curriki as CC-BY; and I now freely share my new material. Now that I am more comfortable using and creating open source materials on my own and with my students, I hope to move on to work with other teachers.</p>
<p><strong>What are the most common confusions or concerns of teachers when it comes to sharing their teaching materials? Do you think the average K-12 teacher is aware of open licensing alternatives, like Creative Commons? What are the various school or institutional policies for teachers sharing their materials?</strong></p>
<p>I am certain that the average teacher is NOT aware of open licensing alternatives. In fact, many teachers I know still operate on the guiding principle of CASE â€“ Copy And Steal Everything. Â I donâ€™t believe teachers are lazy or purposely deceitful for using materials in this way; anyone who has taught in a classroom knows how much there is to do in an incredibly short amount of time. Sometimes, copying an (often copyrighted) activity and tossing it in your colleagueâ€™s box is merely survival. Even those teachers who are aware of copyright will often claim â€œfair use.â€Â  The problem is that teachers often overestimate their protections and privileges under fair use. And there is little training in copyright and fair use, let alone Creative Commons and OER. Not only is an average K â€“ 12 teacher unaware of his or her responsibilities, he or she often does not know the rights and options available to him or her in sharing his or her own work.</p>
<p>There are a variety of roadblocks preventing teachers from sharing their own work. First of all, since creating curriculum takes so much time, many teachers are unwilling to share lessons because they feel the product belongs to them. Other teachers may feel that their work isnâ€™t good enough to share. And even if teachers overcome these psychological blocks, there are still the technical issues revolving around how will they share their work as open source. None of the schools I have worked with had any sort of policies on, or time set aside for, sharing materials. In talking with my colleagues, they found a similar lack of school policy. Even in the rare case in which there was some sort of policy, teachers often selectively ignored it. Currently, most teachers do not have the access, training, and support necessary to confidently participate in the OER movement.</p>
<p><strong>Curriki has been doing some work to tie their resources to state education standards (<a href="http://www.curriki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/BrowseStandards">http://www.curriki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/BrowseStandards</a>). Can you describe a little of that process to us? What are some of the benefits and challenges to including this information? How useful is it?</strong></p>
<p>This work is not part of my professional duties at Curriki, however, I can speak to the process on a personal note as a teacher and Curriki member. Right now, when you visit a resource, you will see four tabs â€“ Content, Information, Standards, and Comments. Choosing the Standards tab allows a user to view currently aligned standards, as well as gives the option to â€œAlign to [additional] Standards.â€Â  The process itself is very intuitive; the user clicks through a series of menus and applies standards as he or she deems appropriate.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit will certainly be the convenience of browsing for resources by standard through the aforementioned jump page. The biggest challenge is to align all of the existing and future resources in the repository. Curriki is depending largely on the community to gather momentum for this process. Right now, in its infancy, only about half of the states have standards-aligned resources to browse, and even those collections are far from complete across subject areas and educational levels. Of course, members of Curriki are always welcome to browse unaligned resources by subject, educational level, or other criteria by using Currikiâ€™s Advanced Search.</p>
<p><strong>There has been a lot of OER talk at the state and federal policy levels, especially surrounding open textbooks. What do you think is the future of the textbook for the K-12 classroom? How would you like to see this reflected in policy?</strong></p>
<p>I, like many educators, feel that the reign of the textbook is coming to an end. As a science teacher, I have rarely depended on a textbook for curriculum, and rely more heavily on both online materials and self-created materials. OER allow me to take better advantage of creating and sharing work within a collaborative community. While science and technology lend themselves to early adoption of the open source philosophy, I believe other subjects will soon follow.</p>
<p>Textbooks will not be able to maintain their current stronghold in Kâ€“12 schools. A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/technology/01ping.html?src=me&amp;ref=technology">New York Times article</a> points out that â€œ[e]ven the traditional textbook publishers agree that the days of tweaking a few pages in a book just to sell a new edition are coming to an end.â€Â  Textbooks are expensive and quickly become outdated. Printed errors are not correctable until the next edition comes out. In contrast, OER are inexpensive or free, constantly updated, and easily correctable. I would love to see the money saved by choosing inexpensive OER over pricey textbooks used for supplementary materials and teacher training. Or even better, districts can use that money to set aside release time and pay teachers to meet, collaborate and create OER content.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, what does a successful teaching and learning environment implementing the power of OER "look like"? Do you have any lingering thoughts---worries, hopes, predictions?</strong></p>
<p>A successful learning environment is relevant, engaging, challenging, and flexible. OER material is current, as well as easily, and legally, adaptable to meet the needs of various learners. An OER community can provide a teacher with materials and support in meeting the needs of his or her particular student population. Resources that are freely shared end up saving others countless hours of redundant individual work and frees teachers from stagnating in a proprietary curriculum.</p>
<p>Schools are beginning to recognize the cost savings of abandoning the current textbook model, and I predict that publishers will adapt as the market demands of them. I hope that schools begin to recognize that teachers are a valuable resource and skilled professionals, and deserve to be compensated for their time spent developing curriculum. I hope districts begin to create policies and provide support to encourage teachers to share the materials they create.</p>
<p>Ideally, the classroom should be a place where students are not merely passive consumers of resources and media, but rather active collaborators, synthesizers and publishers of their own work. I hope that, from a young age, students will be held accountable for using othersâ€™ work in an appropriate way, and encouraged to share their own work as open source with some rights reserved, rather than falling back on the default of full copyright, or worse, not sharing at all. I want my students and colleagues to understand that, by sharing materials, they are contributing to a collection of materials that will benefit learners far beyond the walls of their own classroom. This is a significant shift in current educational philosophy, but sites like Curriki are a great step in facilitating a move in the right direction.</p>
