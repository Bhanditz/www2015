<p><a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>, an easy to use website and blog creation and hosting service, recently made it easy for users to license their content via our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/developerdocs">remote licesning application</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/cc-squarespace-2.png" alt="CC-Squarespace screenshot" /></p>
<p>Here's what Squarespace says within their site management application about Creative Commons:</p>
<blockquote><p>We've integrated a utility that lets you generate Creative Commons licenses for your site. A Creative Commons License is an excellent alternative to default copyright, and lets you retain very specific rights over the works you place on your website. The process for generating a license is one step, and free. Takes about 30 seconds. We recommend giving them a look!</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said! We recommend giving Squarespace and other <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/ccapps">CC-enabled applications</a> a look.</p>
