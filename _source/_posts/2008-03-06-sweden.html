<h2>More about G&ouml;teborg University</h2>
<p>G&ouml;teborg University College was established in 1891 with the help of private donations. The first classes were held by seven professors teaching seven subjects to twenty-one students, four of whom were women. In 1907 it became an independent university college with the same status as the two national universities of Uppsala and Lund. G&ouml;teborg University was formally founded in 1954 through the amalgamation of this college with the Medical College, which had been established in 1949. During the years a number of previously independent colleges have been incorporated into the University. Today G&ouml;teborg University can offer the most comprehensive range of courses and degree programmes in Sweden. G&ouml;teborg University has about 40 000 students, a staff of well over four thousand, and almost as many part-time teachers spread over approx. 70 departments.</p>
