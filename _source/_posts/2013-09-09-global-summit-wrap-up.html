<p>And so we have it - we just came back from the Global Summit, CC's bi-annual meeting of our global community, for another two years.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ccsum&src=hash">resounding opinion</a> seems to be that this year's Summit was a huge success. With over 300 attendees from over 50 countries and 5 days worth of events, it was our biggest meet up yet, and our first to have simultaneous language translation for most of the sessions. It had side events, keynotes, unconferencing, casual meet ups, and a rocking CC Salon. </p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li> the opening night CC Salon, featuring CC-licensing Argentinian musicians <a href="http://pilaresdelacreacion.com.ar/">Shaman y Los Pilares de la CreaciÃ³n</a>, <a href="http://villadiamante.bandcamp.com/">Villa Diamante</a>, and <a href="http://sarahebe.bandcamp.com/ ">Sara Hebe and Ramiro Jota</a>. Visuals were provided by vijay <a href="http://valentinotettamanti.com.ar/">Valentino Tettamanti</a>;</li>
<li>the plenary panel on CC in the Real World, with inspirational projects such as Daniel Reetz's <a href="http://www.diybookscanner.org/">DIY Scanner</a> project and ValentÃ­n Basel's educational robotics project, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Valentinbasel">Fedora</a>;</li>
<li>fruitful discussions about CC's stance on copyright reform, both at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/creativecommons.org/document/d/1AyPs4RNgjG3yk1AnNKnKrVEExgjcKe8N6euStWpbZMs/edit">pre-event miniconference</a> and throughout the Summit. Watch the CC blog for more news on the resulting statement soon.</li>
<li>the keynote by Lawrence Lessig at the <a href="http://www.derecho.uba.ar/">University of Buenos Aires' School of Law</a>, during which he announced that he was teaming up with <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> to launch a <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/lawrence-lessig-strikes-back-against-bogus-copyright-takedown">landmark lawsuit</a> against Liberation Music, who alleged copyright infringement when Lessig used part of one of its songs in a lecture he posted to Youtube. The suit could be an important precedent in defending fair use and setting limits on the overzealous copyright threats that to often occur on the internet.</li>
</ul>
