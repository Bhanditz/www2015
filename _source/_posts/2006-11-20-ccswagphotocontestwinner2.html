<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/franzlife/298169221/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="img/298169221_885ae03521_m.jpg" width="240" align="left" style="margin: 5px;" /></a> This weeks'  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ccswagcontest06/pool/">CC Swag Photo Contest</a> winner was difficult to determine and we thank you all for your very creative submissions - but inevitably we felt compelled to support  photography.</p>
<p> This weeks' winning photograph was taking by Franz Patzig who resides in Germany and is an avid supporter of CC and <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> (he boasts over 1000 photos!). We responded to his unique use of the CC, his composition, use of focus, and the decision to use black and white.</p>
<p>However, I would not be doing my job justice if I did not comment on these three stellar uses of remix shown <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denverjeffrey/301014978/in/pool-ccswagcontest06/">here</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cambodia4kidsorg/300492293/in/pool-ccswagcontest06/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/denverjeffrey/300338550/in/pool-ccswagcontest06/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Again thank you all for participating and remember there are only 4 more weeks remaining so tell your friends, and start shooting!</p>
