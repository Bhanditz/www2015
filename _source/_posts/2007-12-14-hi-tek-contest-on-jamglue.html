<p>Jamglue is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7874">once</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7683">again</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7603">up</a> to their old tricks, this time <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/contests/hitek?src=bnr">giving users the opportunity</a> to add a verse to hip-hop producer Hi-Tek's "My Piano", which features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostface_Killah">Ghostface</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raekwon">Raekwon</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion">Dion</a>. To say it is an all-star cast users will be interacting with is an understatement.</p>
<p>Per usual, everything is released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">BY-NC-SA</a> license. What this allows for is the commercial rights of the artists involved to remain intact, while offering people to experiment and interact with the work in a positive way. In the past, these contests have been incredibly successful in showcasing the power of user-generated content and interaction - you can check out all of Jamglue's <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/contests">past contests here</a>.</p>
