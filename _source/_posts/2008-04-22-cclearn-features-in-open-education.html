<p>Lately, a virtual whirlwind of projects and people and organizations have blown our way, and we don't expect the dust to settle any time soon. To keep track of some of the progress and collaboration within open education, we've started to host bi-monthly features ranging from individual interviews to project spotlights. We hope to open your eyes and ears to what these voices in the movement have to say.</p>
<p>This month's feature is on <strong>"Attribution Only" as Default Policy---Otago Polytechnic on the How and Why of CC BY</strong>; this and all subsequent features will be on our <a title="http://learn.creativecommons.org/" href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">home page</a>. You can join our <a title="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-learn" href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-learn" target="_blank">listserv</a> for automatic updates on these and other ccLearn issues. And for those who like to compartmentalize, you can even sign up for a separate <a title="feed://creativecommons.org/cclearn/feed/rss" href="http://creativecommons.org/category/cclearn/feed/" target="_blank">feed</a> of our news blog.</p>
