<p>Here's a good <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,63332,00.html">piece</a> from <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/">Wired News</a> on the always excellent <a href="http://futureofmusic.org">Future of Music Conference</a>, held this weekend in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>(Sadly no one from Creative Commons HQ was able to make it this year, but plenty of our friends did. Check out Siva Vaidhyanathan's <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001878.shtml">guest spot on our chairman's blog</a> for his take on the event.)</p>
