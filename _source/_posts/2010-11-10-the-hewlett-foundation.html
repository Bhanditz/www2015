<p><strong>Can you give our readers some background on The Hewlett Foundation? What is your role there?</strong></p>
<p>Since 1967, the Hewlett Foundation has been dedicated to making grants to help tackle some of the toughest environmental and social problems facing our world.  Our grantmaking spans six core program areas:  education, environment, global development, performing arts, philanthropy, and population. In addition, the Foundation makes grants to support disadvantaged communities in the Bay Area.  </p>
<p>Within the education program, we focus on three areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting Open Educational Resources(OER), which we define as high-quality, openly licensed educational materials that allow people everywhere to share, use, and reuse knowledge;
</li>
<li>Instilling â€œdeeper learningâ€, e.g. the combination of the fundamental knowledge and practical basic skills students will need to succeed in a fiercely competitive global economy, and;
</li>
<li>Supporting organizations dedicated to improving student achievement in California through state based education reform initiatives.  </li>
</ul>
<p>As the Program Director I oversee a talented staff of four program officers, a part-time associate program officer and three program associates.  Together we build partnerships and collaborate with other funders and through a portfolio of more than 300 active local, national, and international grants, support the important work of our partners in the field.  </p>

<p><strong>What is the link between The Hewlett Foundation and CC? Do you all use our tools in your work?</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons (CC) plays a critical role in the OER â€œeco-systemâ€ by establishing the licensing framework that allows educational materials to be shared, modified and reused.  It is central to our OER grantmaking, and embedded in our proposal process.  The concept of OER is playing an increasingly important role in all of our education activities and beyond, as it makes possible the creation of high-quality, relevant materials at radically reduced costs.  </p>
<p><strong>The Hewlett Foundation is a significant sponsor of Creative Commons - what was the motivation behind this generous giving? What is it about CC that you find important?</strong></p>
<p>We at Hewlett are proud of our support and longtime association with Creative Commons.  OER would not be able to grow and scale as much as it has without the coherence and simplicity provided by Creative Commons licenses. Its rapid growth across sectors and geographies is a testament to CCâ€™s nimble and innovative, solution-oriented practices and the intrinsic human desire to learn and to share knowledge.  </p>
<p><strong>What do you see as CC's role in the broader digital ecosystem? How does CC enable The Hewlett Foundation to better innovate in that space?</strong></p>
<p>I believe that CC will play an increasingly important role in the broader digital and educational ecosystem.  In the U.S., the provision of a legal architecture that explicitly allows materials to be adapted to suit local and individual student needs will be a key enabler of the national drive toward personalized learning; it will play an important role in undergirding curricular materials as the state-based Common Core Standards movement shifts to implementation.   Internationally, the take-up of high quality OERs, particularly in developing nations, will be even more significant as access to the internet continues its exponential growth.<br />
From the standpoint of a foundation, CC licenses on grant-funded resources, products and research enables them to be useful for a much broader audience.  The feedback loops that are created as a result of open licensing enable iterative knowledge-sharing, research, and continuous growth and progress in the work we support. More broadly, as we move to operating in a time of scarce resources and almost infinite demand for learning and education, it is critical that we build on each otherâ€™s work and share resources as efficiently as possible.  CC makes this possible.</p>
