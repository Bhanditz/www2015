<p>The Creative Commons' sponsored music community, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a>, has had a busy week.</p>
<p><b>Imaginashun Remixes</b></p>
<p>DJ Vadim, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14586">featured and interviewed last week</a>, put out a <a href="http://ccmixter.org/imaginashun">Call for Remixes</a> for his new album <i>U Can't Lurn Imaginashun</i> and the remixes are the community has responded in kind and some amazing remixes are <a href="http://ccmixter.org/api/query?tags=imaginashun&amp;title=Imaginashun%20Remixes&amp;sort=rank&amp;ord=desc">starting to come in</a>.</p>
<p><b>CC0 Enabled</b></p>
<p>ccMixter is now offering the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 (CC Zero)</a> waiver for sample uploads. (<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0">CC0 FAQ</a>) With this waiver, musicians who upload samples of their work in the form of solo instruments (often looped for easy re-use) are indicating their willingness to participate in the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing#Material_in_the_public_domain">vast public domain</a> (like the <a href="http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/">World Wide Web itself</a>). The CC0 license carries with it the most freedoms possible, or put another way, the least "<a href="http://gonze.com/blog/2009/06/03/advocacy-for-cc-0-over-by-sa/#comment-3440">friction around your work</a>," meaning, it's the most accessible form of sharing available. James Boyle's <a href="http://thepublicdomain.org"><i>The Public Domain</i></a> (mentioned here many times <a>before</a>) remains the best resource around for getting to understand the importance of a public commons, especially in terms of our culture and creativity itself.</p>
<p>It only took a few minutes for the waiver to be enabled on ccMixter for veteran member <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/spinmeister/profile">spinmeister</a> to upload <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/spinmeister/21067">all the samples</a> to an original composition under the CC0 waiver. "I personally like the idea of a world," he explained, "where a portion (not all) of good stuff is gifted. I also think itâ€™s pretty cool when people who have received gifts are making gifts to someone else as their 'response'." Read the rest of spin's explanation <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/1925#64845">in the forum thread</a>  announcing the arrival of CC0 at ccMixter.</p>
<p><b>ccHost 5.1 Release Candidate</b></p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/cchost">ccHost</a> is the open source project that powers ccMixter and is currently going through a release candidate phase for the it's 5.1 version. The previous major version, 4.0, was the winner of the Linux Journal's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6026">LinuxWorld Expo Product Excellence Award</a> for Best Open Source Solution and has been very popular as a remix-aware, web management system for liberally licensed content. Last year saw the release of a major upgrade (5.0) while this 5.1 update marks a full year of real-world usage, making it one of the most stable releases of ccHost ever, with 100s of bug fixes on top of the 60+ feature enhancements leading up to this RC release. Those enhancements include many that ccHost sites have long been asking for, including support for OpenID log in and registration. This release boasts extensive admin control of licensing options, built-in special handling for CC0 waivers and support for Creative Commons' latest license tools like RDFa scraping. For the more visually oriented, 5.1 comes with a new skin that mirrors the 2009 clean, simplified look and feel of the mother ship CC site. (See the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=80503&amp;release_id=687837">release notes and changelog</a> for the gory details.)</p>
<p>To all the ccHost-enabled site administrators and developers holding off upgrading from 4.x to 5.x, this is the stability release you've been waiting for. Please <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&amp;package_id=156675">download the RC</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Cchost#Contacting">send us feedback</a> on what you find.</p>
<p><b>ccMixter Music Podcasts</b></p>
<p>In a forum posting from <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/1547#43230">June 17, 2008</a>, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/mcjackinthbox/profile">MC Jack in the Box</a>, our resident double-agent from the very cool <a href="http://remixfight.org">RemixFight</a> (a forerunner and model for ccMixter) mentioned nonchalantly that he might have come up with "a cool way to build buzz for the playlists if people can record their own radio shows featuring ccMixter uploads. ... Iâ€™d create a themed show, with me adding a few 'hidden' voiceovers to the show. Hell, I might even do a weekly 'best of ccMixter' kind of show if that could happen."</p>
<p>Thus began the "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/view/media/playlists/featured">Cool Music Show</a>", a weekly feature that quickly became the most popular way to discover new music on ccMixter. Every Friday, like clockwork, he curates upwards of 45 minutes of the best uploads from the previous seven days on the site. Last week, MC Jack posted <a href="http://ccmixter.org/playlist/browse/4845">episode #50</a> (!) to raves, kudos and <a href="http://ccmixterblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/cool-music-show-50.html">much hazaa</a> from a grateful ccMixter nation.</p>
<p>We decided to use the occasion of the 50th show to <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/1929">launch</a> the new <a href="http://ccmixter.org/view/media/playlists/podcast">ccMixter Music Podcast</a>. Using the ccMixter playlist as a basis, <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/viewsvn/cchost/trunk/mixter-files/podcast.zip?view=log">we developed the tools</a> to create a single, seamless MP3 and post it to the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Cool_Music_May_28_June_4__2009_06_04">archive.org</a>.</p>
<p>To subscribe to the show, just drag <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ccMixter_music"><b>this link</b></a> to your podcast-aware music player (e.g. iTunes, Amarok, etc.).</p>
<p>We seeded the podcast with the last 7 Cool Music shows, but as explained in the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/1929">announcement thread</a>, we want other community members to contribute their own shows. So, if you have curating and MC skills you'd like to share, we invite you to submit a ccMixter music show of your very own! Instructions for how to do make and submit a show is <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/1929">here</a>.</p>
