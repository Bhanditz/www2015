<p>I recently ran across <a href="http://doctorparadox.net/hear/">Doctor Paradox</a> (a.k.a. <a href="http://dykesdodigital.org/barbwiki/index.php?WhoAmI">Barb</a>). She creates very funky, fun, and creative sample-loop-based music using Ableton Live and other tools for the Mac. </p>
<p>I recently spoke with her about CC licensing, <i>found art</i> in remixes, and music in general. Apparently I caught her in the middle of reading Larry Lessig's <a href="http://www.the-future-of-ideas.com/">The Future of Ideas</a>, so she had a lot of good things say on the matter, not the least of which is the idea that: "all art is <i>found art</i> to some degree. Ideas have origins and everything is fundamentally connected." </p>
<p>She sees CC licensing as a part of the re-connecting of art to what it is meant to be, an organic part of everyday lifestyle: "Even as recently as a few decades ago, music was still something people did in their homes to entertain themselves, their families, and friends. Now in the midst of a radical technological revolution, we are starting to have access to the tools we need to craft music in our own vision, according to our own philosophies."</p>
<p>"For me, the dream and vision of Creative Commons is that by making an enormous amount of high-quality art available to society, our culture's demand for, and appreciation of art itself is bound to increase."</p>
<p>Well, we appreciate her artistic contribution -- that's for sure. Her entire album "<a href="http://doctorparadox.net/hear/">Frame Independent</a>" is licensed under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike</a> license. Give it a spin.</p>
