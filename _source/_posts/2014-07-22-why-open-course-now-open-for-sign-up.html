<p>Another run of <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a> courses is starting up in August, September and October! The first course to kick things off is a second iteration of "<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/">Why Open?</a>" "Why Open?" was collaboratively developed and facilitated one year ago in August 2013; now the facilitators are back to run it a second time from <strong>10 August to 5 September 2014</strong>. What is "Why Open?" From its <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2314/why-open/">About page</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Why Open? What does open mean? Does it mean free? Does it mean without restriction? What is the role of the producer? What is the role of the consumer? Why is open important? How does open relate to you and your area of expertise?<br />
<br />
In this course, we will discuss and answer these questions. With your help, we will explore the different meanings of open in various contexts as well as its benefits and issues. Participants will use open practices to complete a series of open activities that builds into a final project.</p></blockquote>
<p>Facilitators include <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/clhendricksbc/">Christina Hendricks</a> (Philosophy lecturer at the University of British Columbia), Simeon Oriko (<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/mtotowajirani/">School of Open Kenya Initiative</a>), <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/Jeannette/">Jeanette Lee</a> (English lit and writing teacher), and <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/Janepark/">myself</a>.</p>
