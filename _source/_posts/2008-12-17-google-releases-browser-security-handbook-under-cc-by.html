<p>Last week Google <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/announcing-browser-security-handbook.html">published</a> a 60 page equivalent <a href="http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Main">Browser Security Handbook</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution license</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In hopes of helping to make the Web a safer place, we decided to release our Browser Security Handbook to the general public. This 60-page document provides a comprehensive comparison of a broad set of security features and characteristics in commonly used browsers, along with (hopefully) useful commentary and implementation tips for application developers who need to rely on these mechanisms, as well as engineering teams working on future browser-side security enhancements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although this may sound dry, the handbook is effectively a highly readable and fascinating explanation of many of the reasons the web and web browsers work as they do. Highly recommended for deep reading by anyone remotely involved in web development, and for skimming by everyone else.</p>
<p>Hopefully publication under the most liberal CC license, allowing republication, modification, and commercial use, so long as credit is given, will help this important content find its way into developer, educational, and training resources around the world.</p>
