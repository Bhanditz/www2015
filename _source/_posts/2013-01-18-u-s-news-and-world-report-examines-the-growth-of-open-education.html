<p>This week, U.S. News and World Report ran an <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/17/the-growing-adoption-of-creative-commons-textbooks">excellent story</a> about the rise of openly-licensed educational materials. Simon Owens' article touches on many of the open education landmarks we've been celebrating over the past year, including the Department of Labor's <a href="/weblog/entry/34328">TAA-CCCT grant program</a> and open textbook legislation in <a href="/weblog/entry/34566">British Columbia</a> and <a href="/weblog/entry/34288">California</a>. Owens interviewed CC director of global learning Cable Green as well as <a href="http://davidwiley.org/">David Wiley</a>, the <a href="http://www.20mm.org/">Twenty Million Minds Foundation</a>'s Dean Florez, and several other experts in the space.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/17/the-growing-adoption-of-creative-commons-textbooks">From the article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon its launch a decade ago, Creative Commons was embraced by the artist and literary community, and its iconic logo began appearing on the sidebars of thousands of blogs, web pages, and Flickr photos. By 2005, the nonprofit estimated there were 20 million works that utilized the license, and by 2009 that number had climbed to 350 million. But while the organization has always embraced its grassroots enthusiasm, it continually sought recognition and adoption from larger, more traditional institutions.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The philosophy behind this goal is simple. "The public should have access to what it paid for," says [Cable Green]. "Free access and legal access to what it bought. The tagline is 'buy one get one.' If you buy something, you should get access to it." And it shouldn't come as a surprise that Creative Commons activists have identified education materials as a prime target for their view. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that student loan debt had surpassed auto loans and credit debt, coming in at an estimated $1 trillion. And a not-insignificant contribution to this burden has been the rising cost of textbooks.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>[&#8230;]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>David Wiley, an associate professor of instructional psychology and technology at Brigham University in Utah, has been immersed in the OER community predating the creation of the Creative Commons license. He was inspired by a group of technologists who met in 1998 to rebrand the free software movement as "open source," and he later worked to develop an "open content" license that would allow content creators to share and distribute their content easily. "The only difference was that all of us who were initially involved weren't lawyers," he recalls. "We were just making stuff up. It was scary, because there were hundreds of thousands of people who were using these licenses, and if any of them actually went to court, who knows what would have happened?" Imagine his relief then when the Creative Commons license was formed. "I put a big notice on our website saying, 'please everyone, run away from our licenses as fast as you can. Here are real lawyers that have done something similar but way better.'"</p></blockquote>
