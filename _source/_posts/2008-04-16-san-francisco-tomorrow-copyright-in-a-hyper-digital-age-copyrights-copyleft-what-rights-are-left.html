<p>Many events featuring CC in California over the next and past few days.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8206">CC Salon Los Angeles</a> starts in an hour.</p>
<p>On Sunday I spoke at Lugradio Live USA (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mlinksva/lugradio-live-usa-2008-creative-commons">slides</a>), as did CC-enabled record label Magnatune's founder, John Buckman (<a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2008/04/lugradio-live-p.html">his slides</a>). Given that Lugradio Live is primarily a Linux conference, we each did a take on open source and open content.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Thursday) I'll be on a panel titled <a href="http://asmpnorcal.org/drupal/?q=node/441">Copyright in a Hyper Digital Age: Copyrights? Copyleft? What rights are left?</a> sponsored by the American Society of Media Photographers Northern California. Full details at the link. Free for society members, $10 for the public, or $5 with email RSVP. There's an <a href="http://asmpnorcal.org/drupal/?q=forum/74">event forum</a> in which to post questions in advance.</p>
<p>Friday <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8204">CC will be on a panel</a> in San Jose on <a href="http://cla04182008-emailinvite.eventbrite.com/">New Media Artists and the Law</a> put on by California Lawyers for the Arts.</p>
<p>Of course there's always lots happening around the world in CC land -- check <a href="http://planet.creativecommons.org/jurisdictions/">Planet Creative Commons</a> for updates and our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8193">latest newsletter highlighting international projects</a> for evidence.</p>
