<p><a href="http://www.prathambooks.org/">Pratham Books</a> is a nonprofit publisher started by the <a href="http://www.pratham.org/">Pratham</a> Education Initiative, which, since 1994, has been working to secure primary education for every child in India. "Pratham Books is a not-for-profit trust that seeks to publish high-quality books for children at a affordable cost in multiple Indian languages. Pratham Books is trying to create a shift in the paradigm for publishing childrenâ€™s books in India."</p>
<p>While working with One Laptop Per Child and the Open Learning Exchange in Nepal, Pratham Books decided to contribute educational books and other content for use in low cost laptops and an open <a href="http://www.pustakalaya.org/">eBook library</a>. They released six books under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/in/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>, and they are available for download at <a href="http://www.scribd.com/people/documents/128645/folder/49703?secret_password=3i31nhz6kibxvg582pe">Scribd</a>. The children's books include titles like <em>The Moon and the Cap</em>, <em>Annual Haircut Day</em>, and books that make mathematics fun---translated into Neplai for local use. Pratham Books also has an imprint, <a href="http://www.prathambooks.org/">Read India</a>, that publishes more children's books in many different Indian languages and at low cost to make them more universally accessible.</p>
<p>Currently, the format of the books are in PDF, but Gautum John of Pratham <a href="http://bokaap.net/bits-and-pieces/pratham-books-goes-cc-by-nc-sa/">writes</a> that this will soon change, as they are working on a platform to remix books and they will also be available in HTML. Check out their official blog post about it <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/2008/11/on-joining-commons.html">here</a>.</p>
