<p><a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/index.shtml">Strange Horizons</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction">speculative-fiction</a> webzine that publishes short fiction, poetry, reviews and articles on a weekly basis, have recently added an option allowing authors to publish their works under a CC license. Many authors have taken them up on the offer, including Ben Rosenbaum, whose desire to release his Hugo-nominated "<a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2006/20060904/house-f.shtml">The House Beyond Your Sky</a>" under a CC-licence spearheaded the entire process.</p>
<p>Strange Horizon's adoption of CC-licenses allows, very simply, for greater flexibility in terms of how an author's work is distributed online. Jed Hartmen, co-editor of SH, puts it well:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Some authors would be happy to allow anyone who wants to do so to translate their work into another language or another medium. (â€œWant to make a music video out of my story? Go ahead!â€) Some authors would be fine with letting other people make copies of their work as long as nobody is making any money from the copying. And so on; there are a variety of license options."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is great to see this sort of adoption taking place, especially from a publication that <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> calls "one of the best short fiction publishers in the world".

Oh, and they're running a <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/fund_drives/200707/main.shtml">fundraising drive</a> as well.</p>
