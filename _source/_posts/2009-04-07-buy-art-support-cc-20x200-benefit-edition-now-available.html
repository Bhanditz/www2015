Love art and CC? Head over to the <a href="http://www.20x200.com">20x200</a> homepage and check out this special benefit edition by designer <a href="http://magicalnihilism.wordpress.com/">Matt Jones</a>, just released. Proceeds from the sale of these exhibition-quality art prints will go to benefit Creative Commons; so for as little as $20 you'll have the opportunity to acquire this special edition work, all the while supporting CC. The prints are going fast, so hurry and secure yours before they run out!</p>
<p>Thank you to Matt Jones for his generosity in selecting CC as the beneficiary for his special 20x200 edition, and thanks to everyone taking advantage of this unique opportunity to support CC.</p>
