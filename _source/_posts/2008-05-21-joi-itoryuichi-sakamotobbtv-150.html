<p>For the <a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/05/20/cooking-young-bamboo.html#more">150th episode of the fantastic Boing Boing tv</a>, Xeni et al. have digi-traveled to Japan, visiting <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#93">CC CEO</a> <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a> to learn how to hunt for and prepare bamboo shoots. Accompanied by a wonderful score from <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2007/07/30/ryuichi-sakamot-1.html">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, the video is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a> licensed and a soothing way to begin your day. You can read about how the whole project came to fruition on <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/05/20/video-of-cookin.html">Joi's blog</a>, including a pretty amusing anecdote about finding CC-licensed music (I, for one, think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_(musician)">Cornelius</a> would make wonderful musical accompaniment to bamboo hunting).</p>
