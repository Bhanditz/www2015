<p>We are thrilled to announce our involvement in the 7th annual WikiSym,  International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration. WikiSym explores the impact of wikis, open resources, and open technologies across all sectors of society, including education, law, journalism, art, science, publishing, business, and entertainment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikisym.org/ws2011/">WikiSym 2011</a> will be held in Mountain View, California on October 3-5. You donâ€™t want to miss this conference. WikiSym draws an international group of leading thinkers from industry, non-profits and academia. Last yearâ€™s  WikiSym 2010 in Poland was packed with exciting people and ideas. WikiSym 2011 is gearing up to be the best gathering on open collaboration ever held.</p>
<p>Creative Commons <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/2011/02/16/creative-commons-sponsors-wikisym-2011/">is an official sponsor</a> of the event, and we will be presenting some of our ideas on Open Educational Resources (<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER">OER</a>) and open content in general.</p>
<p>Want to present your ideas at WikiSym 2011? The program will include: research papers, workshops, panel discussions, poster sessions, demos, and a doctoral symposium. See the <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/ws2011/submitting:start">call for participation page</a> for details and deadlines. Be sure to follow theirÂ <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/">blog</a> and Twitter account for updates leading up to the event.</p>
