<p>This week we're featuring physics textbooks that are <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1book1.html#download">available for free download under Creative Commons licenses</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1.html">Light and Matter series</a> of introductory physics textbooks, as implied by its title, has a <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1.html#storyline">story line</a> built around light and matter. The outlines of <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1dp.html">Discover Physics</a> and <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1sn.html">Simple Nature</a> are based on conservation laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>The author states reasons <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1sales.html#why">why the books are available</a> for free, encourages reporting of errors and sharing of problem sets, and keeps track of <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/area1.html#reviews">schools adopting the titles</a> as textbooks.</p>
