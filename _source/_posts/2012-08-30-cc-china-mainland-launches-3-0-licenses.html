<p>After more than two years of hard work, the CC China Mainland 3.0 licenses are ready for use. Congratulations to Chunyan Wang and the entire CC China Mainland team. Thank you to everyone who helped create these licenses, including the community members who participated in the public discussion.</p>

<p>The China Mainland licenses are now available on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/?lang=zh_CN&jurisdiction=cn">CC license chooser</a>. You can learn more about the CC China Mainland team and their work on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/China_Mainland">CC wiki</a> and at <a href="http://creativecommons.net.cn/">http://creativecommons.net.cn/</a>. The CC China Mainland 3.0 licenses are one of the last 3.0 ports to conclude, with the few other remaining suites expected to be launched prior to publication of the version 4.0 licenses. As announced to affiliates at the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29639">CC Global Summit in Warsaw</a> almost a year ago, and reiterated last <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29472">October</a> and this past <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31648">February</a>, other than a very few ports then well underway, Creative Commons put the porting process on hold. This has allowed staff and our affiliates to focus more fully on the important work of versioning the license suite. We encourage all affiliates, CC community members and others interested in CC licenses to contribute to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">4.0 discussions</a> currently in progress.</p>
