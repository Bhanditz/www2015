<p>Today, <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.nike.com">Nike</a> and <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com">Best Buy</a>, announces a new project - <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/greenxchange">GreenXchange</a> - exploring how the digital commons can help holders of patents collaborate for sustainability. GreenXchange will be hosted inside the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> wing of CC.</p>
<p>GreenXchange draws on the experience of Creative Commons in creating<a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/"> "some rights reserved"</a> regimes for artists, musicians, scientists, and educators, but also on the hard-won successes of patent "commons" projects like the <a href="http://linuxfoundation.org/en/About">Linux Patent Commons</a>, the <a href="http://www.bios.net/daisy/bios/home.html">BIOS project</a>, <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/">FreePatentsOnline</a> and the <a href="http://www.wbcsd.org/templates/TemplateWBCSD5/layout.asp?type=p&amp;MenuId=MTQ3NQ&amp;doOpen=1&amp;ClickMenu=LeftMenu">Eco-Patent Commons</a>. We will examine how best to reconstruct the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_exemption">academic research exemption</a> eliminated in the United States in the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/2002Madeyedit.html">Madey v. Duke case</a>, how to extend that exemption to corporate research, how private contract systems can be used to <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?66+Law+&amp;+Contemp.+Probs.+315+(WinterSpring+2003)">construct a commons for use in sustainability</a>. There is also a technical component - we are very interested in how tools like <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">semantic web</a> will allow for new methods of tracking use and re-use of patents and integration of shared patents into climate and sustainability model.</p>
<p>GreenXchange is very much an exploratory project. Our goal is to stimulate innovation in the operational space by increasing research use and rights through the some rights reserved model, and to extend the model itself all the way into standard commercial patent licensing for sustainability purposes. Our model is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation">open innovation</a>, our methods are those of the digital commons, and we are very excited to be working with our new partners to help them overcome <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos/a-shared-culture">"failed sharing"</a> to help us all work towards a sustainable world.</p>
