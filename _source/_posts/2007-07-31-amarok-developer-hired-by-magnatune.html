<p>While software and services companies for years have hired many free software developers to continue to work on their free software projects and employees of open content companies have contributed to free software projects, this may be the first time an open content company has hired a free software developer to work on the developer's free software project.</p>
<p>I suspect this will be the first of many such hires. Open content companies are growing and often are highly dependent on free software for infrastructure and end user services.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Magnatune and Nikolaj! There's a placeholder article on the CC Wiki concerning <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Amarok" rel="tag">Amarok/CC integration</a>.</p>
