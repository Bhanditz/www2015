<p>Technical wizard (music and code) Victor Stone retired as the lead <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> developer a few months ago. So what's he doing with all that extra time (apart from continuing to commit <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CcHost">ccHost</a> patches)? One would assume a chunk of it went into completing his new album, <em><a href="http://fourstones.net/laviechill/">La Vie Chill</a></em>.</p>
<p>Victor <a href="http://virtualturntable.fourstones.net/la-vie-chill">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]tâ€™s dedicated to my new favorite place to hang out on the web, where else, <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>. One of the emergent stars of the site, Eric <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/teru">teru</a> Ohara (think <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nordic</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Irish</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Asian</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Canadian</span> <b>brilliant</b>),<br />
gave me a fantastic remix that I used â€œas isâ€ thank you very much. For<br />
the rest of the album I made extensive use of samples from Magnatune<br />
(for which I pay royalties per sale) and ccMixter (for which I got<br />
permission to pillage), but I really feel as though these are original<br />
compositions -- by the way: does anybody else recognize the oxymoron in<br />
the term "original composition" or is it just me?

<p>Visit the <a href="http://fourstones.net/laviechill/">album page</a> to listen/download/buy/license and see links to all of the <a href="http://fourstones.net/laviechill/credits">sources</a> Victor used on the album.</p>
<p>A funny thing about Victor's site: he's incorporated ccHost (see his tag-a-rific <a href="http://fourstones.net/media/view/media/catalog">catalog</a>) and WordPress (<a href="http://virtualturntable.fourstones.net/">blog</a>), with both sharing the same look.  ccHost was intended for remix communities, but you can't restrict good software to its original use. Same goes for good content...</p>
