<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secondary-Sound-Justin-Sirois/dp/1934289647/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201607155&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Secondary Sound</em></a>, a book of poems and short stories by Justin Sirois, was recently released simultaneously through <a href="http://www.blazevox.org/bk-js.htm">BlazeVOX [books]</a> as well as online via a<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/poetry/thepixelplus/secondaryccfreedowload.html">free PDF</a>. Much of <em>Secondary Sound</em>, which is released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA license</a>, addresses copyright reform and freedom of information, making for interesting parallels and diversions between content and distribution. From <a href="http://www.blazevox.org/bk-js.htm">BlazeVOX [books]</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An absurdist media firm hires a pirate to "create the most alluring ringtone known to man" â€“ while the author takes a secondary role as this digital scallywag plunders and pillages his way through the book's vexing text messages. Presumably the first manuscript of both poems and fiction to be licensed with creative commons, Secondary Sound questions the legal limits of electronic sampling, asks why zombies and pirates are so in vogue, and pushes the limits of poetry (and hopefully makes it fun again). </p></blockquote>
