<p>Palo Alto, USA, and Berlin, GERMANY. Creative Commons, a non-profit<br />
organization seeking to promote the sharing of high-quality content,<br />
today introduced its highly innovative licensing system for copyrighted<br />
digital material to Germany. The Creative Commons licenses, which are<br />
already widely used in the United States, Brazil, Japan, and Finland by<br />
authors, composers and other artists to share their work with others,<br />
were transposed into German law by a team of professional lawyers and<br />
legal academics. Creative Commons staff of the organization's two offices<br />
in Palo Alto and Berlin collaborated with the ifrOSS institute and<br />
Professor Dreier from the University of Karlsruhe (TH) on the project.</p>
<p>"The launch of the German licenses is a momentous step towards creating a<br />
new and truly global layer of reasonable copyright law," points out<br />
Lawrence Lessig, chairman of Creative Commons and professor at Stanford<br />
University Law School, who is currently delivering a series of lectures<br />
on intellectual property rights at the WOS 3 Conference in Berlin, the<br />
Wissenschaftskolleg, Grunewald, and the European Commission in Brussels.</p>
<p>After launches in Japan and Brazil earlier this year, Germany and Finland<br />
are the first jurisdictions in the European Union (EU) in which the<br />
Creative Commons licensing-system (proclaiming "some rights reserved"<br />
instead of "all rights reserved") is available in local language<br />
versions.</p>
<p>By adding Germany and Finland to the available range of jurisdictions<br />
Creative Commons's international expansion progresses at an accelerated<br />
pace. "We look forward to being able to offer local language licenses to<br />
all European users in the near future," says Christiane Asschenfeldt, the<br />
iCommons Coordinator, based in Berlin. "Our project leads around the<br />
world -- almost all volunteers -- display a great sense of enthusiasm and<br />
devotion to our dream of recreating a healthy public domain."</p>
