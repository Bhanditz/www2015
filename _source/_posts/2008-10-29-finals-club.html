<p><a href="http://finalsclub.org/">Finals Club</a> is a new website that aims to provide an online space for college students to blog about class lectures as well as converse in forums on a range of academic topics. Students can form groups, invite their friends to join, and assign tasks all with the goal of a more comprehensive learning experience and, as the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=524628">Harvard Crimson</a> points out, increased "transparency among study groups."</p>
<p>All of the user-generated content at Finals Club is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC license</a>, keeping the content created therein open and free to use for future students. While currently only available at a select group of universities, Finals Club shows great promise as a platform for students to collaborate academically in an open manner.</p>
