<p>From <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/mayerandbettle2">CC Australia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following [Mayer and Bettle's] fabulously successful <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/animation_train">cinematic debut</a>, in which they introduced us all to Creative Commons, the new film provides a bit of an update as to what has been happening in Creative Commons over the last two years, and gives us a bit more information on using the Creative Commons licences. To do this, they travel into Creative Commons world, and run into one of Bettle's fans and collaborators, Flik.</p></blockquote>
<p>The animation is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Australia license</a>, and the full video can be dowloaded in high resolution flash format <a href="http://www.engagemedia.org/Members/elliottb/videos/CC_0408_512x288_lo_PAL.flv">here</a>.</p>
