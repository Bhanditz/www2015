Hot on the heels of a popular web design demonstration at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS zen garden</a>, No Sight At Night has <a href="http://www.nosightatnight.co.uk/challenge/">launched their own redesign challenge</a>, asking designers to create new looks for the site using cascading style sheets (CSS), with all submissions licensed under a Creative Commons license for others to share.</p>
