<p>The title says it all. From <a href="http://openeducationnews.org/2009/04/30/open-education-news-contest/">Open Education News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In this contest, your task is to design a logo and banner picture for <a href="http://openeducationnews.org/">Open Education News</a>.</p>
<p>The blog authors have different backgrounds but something great in common: the passionate belief that Open Educational Resources are a great way to produce quality educational materials that are far more accessible and flexible than traditional, commercial materials.</p>
<p>Open Education News provides readers with a daily dose of the most relevant open education and open educational resources news from around the world."</p></blockquote>
<p>The prize for the winning logo are t-shirts from CC's much coveted <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/store">schwag collection</a> and the Cape Town Open Education Declaration. So if you are suddenly hit with inspiration during your lunch break tomorrow, read the <a href="http://openeducationnews.org/2009/04/30/open-education-news-contest/">contest rules</a> and submit a logo by May 31!</p>
