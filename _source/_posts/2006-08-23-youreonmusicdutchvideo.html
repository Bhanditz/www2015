<p>CC Netherlands held a music contest and had a distinguished panel of judges select 13 tracks of 130 submissions.  They want to release a DVD ... so they need video.  That's where you come in.  Read about the video contest on <a href="http://icommons.org/2006/08/23/ccnetherlands-wants-your-visuals-for-a-dvd/">iCommons.org</a> and <a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl/dvd/index_en.php">creativecommons.nl</a>.</p>
