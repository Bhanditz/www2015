<p>Attention all remixers: <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> is hosting the new <a href="http://ccmixter.org/copyrightcriminals">Copyright Criminals Remix Contest</a>. Producers from all over the world are encouraged to use CC-licensed audio samples from <a href="http://www.kembrew.com/">Kembrew McLeod</a> and Ben Franzen's upcoming documentary film <a href="http://www.copyrightcriminals.com/"><i>Copyright Criminals</i></a> in new musical compositions. The best entry will appear prominently in the final version of <i>Copyright Criminals</i> and the top twelve tracks will be featured on the film's companion CD. Download a PDF containing the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/mixter-files/copyrightcriminals/copyright_criminals_rules_final.pdf">official contest rules</a> and read our recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/5715">press release</a> announcing the competition.</p>
<blockquote><p>"This contest, like our documentary, examines what it means to be creative in an age of digital reproduction," says Kembrew McLeod, co-director of <i>Copyright Criminals</i>. "Artists have traditionally borrowed from each other and have been directly inspired by the world around them. But what happens when digital technologies allow for very literal quotes to be inserted into new works?"</p></blockquote>
