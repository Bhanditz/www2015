<p>In <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/education/31iht-riedopen.html">As Colleges Make Courses Available Free Online, Others Cash In</a></em> the New York Times writes about how universities are funding OpenCourseWare programs as well as how businesses have sprung up around CC licensed Open Educational Resources (OER) from such programs. Regarding the latter, our CEO is quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>On a philosophical level, the idea of making money from something available free might seem questionable. But Joi Ito, chief executive of Creative Commons, which issues the licenses defining user rights to most OpenCourseWare materials, supports the mixing of free and for-profit: â€œI think thereâ€™s a great deal of commercial infrastructure that needs to be created in order for this to be successful,â€ Mr. Ito said: â€œIt canâ€™t all just be free.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>As readers steeped in knowledge of free culture/open content (and before it free and open source software) will recognize, this means three things.</p>
<p>First, sharing does not preclude making money. To the contrary, artists have long been making CC licensing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12695">part of their business strategies</a>, and recently some OER creators and companies are following suit. Examples include <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21440">WikiPremed</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20805">Flat World Knowledge</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10100">Bloomsbury Academic</a>. See Eric Frank explain how Flat World Knowledge gives away CC licensed open textbooks and profits from print materials and services rendered around the content in a <a href="http://blip.tv/file/3420050">video</a> just uploaded from CC Salon NYC.</p>
<p>Second, there needs to be an ecosystem built around open materials, and businesses are an important part of that ecosystem. In the OER space the article mentions <a href="http://academicearth.org/">Academic Earth</a>. Consider the many businesses providing services around CC licensed materials more broadly (e.g., Flickr, and Fotopedia, which leverages CC licensed works from both Flickr and Wikipedia) and the legion of businesses build around free software (e.g., Red Hat). Consider how huge education is. The opportunity and need for businesses that provide distribution, curation, and a plethora of other services around OER are huge.</p>
<p>Third, free can refer to price and freedom. Businesses, universities, and others can charge a price for access or services around OER. The ecosystem works due to the freedoms that have been granted to use and build upon OER.</p>
<p>The article also mentions the values of OER, one of which is to "[create] an incentive for universities to improve themselves." It quotes Cathy Casserly, who <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20358">recently joined</a> the Creative Commons board of directors:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œI think that by putting some of the spectacular professors, and putting their approaches and pedagogical instructional strategies that they use with their students in front of the world, it sets a new benchmark for all of us to learn from,â€ she said. â€œAnd I think thatâ€™s actually one of the incredible powers of this open educational resource.â€</p></blockquote>
