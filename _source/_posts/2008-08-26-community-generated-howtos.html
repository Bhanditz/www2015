<p>Molly Kleinman, the "multi-purpose" librarian, has started putting together some easy to digest HowTos on Creative Commons. In <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/2008/08/15/cc-howto-1-how-to-attribute-a-creative-commons-licensed-work/">HowTo #1</a> she details some very reasonable examples of proper attribution:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>An Ideal Attribution</strong><br />
This video features the song â€œPlay Your Part (Pt.1)â€ by Girl Talk, available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license. Â© 2008, Greg Gillis.<br />
<strong><br />

<p>In <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/2008/08/21/cc-howto-2-how-to-use-a-work-with-a-noncommercial-license/">HowTo #2</a>, Molly gives some examples to demonstrate our NonCommercial license:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>Using an illustration on a birthday party invitation = Non-commercial<br />
Using an illustration on a charity auction invitation = Commercial</li>
<li>Using a song as the soundtrack to a collection of home videos for the family reunion = Non-commercial<br />
Using a song as the soundtrack to an advertisement for a Family Reunion Travel deal = Commercial</li>
<li>Using a photo on a personal website that has no ads = Non-commercial<br />
Using a photo on an ad-supported website = Commercial</li>
</ol>
