<p>San Francisco, USA, and Johannesburg, SOUTH AFRICA, June 1, 2005 -<br />
 Creative Commons, a non-profit organization that offers free copyright<br />
 licenses and tools to creators to make their works available on more<br />
 flexible terms, unveiled a localized version of its innovative<br />
 licensing system in South Africa last week.</p>
<p>With South Africa offering Creative Commons licenses tailored for the<br />
 specifics of the legal system in South Africa, Creative Commons<br />
 licenses and tools are now available a total of 18 jurisdictions. The<br />
 organization already provides copyright licenses specific to<br />
 Australian, Austrian, Brazilian, Belgian, Canadian, Croatian, Dutch,<br />
 English & Welsh, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish,<br />
 U.S., Taiwanese and Spanish law, thanks to a global network of<br />
 artists, lawyers, and technologists.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonâ€™s offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked<br />
 with Project Leads Heather Ford and Andrew Rens as well as the LINK<br />
 Centre at the University of Witwatersrand to adapt the standardized<br />
 licenses for use in South Africa. Heather Ford is a former Reutersâ€™<br />
 fellow at Stanford Law School and the director of the Creative Commons<br />
 South Africa project.  Heather has already built an energetic creative<br />
 community in South Africa around the Creative Commons licenses.<br />
 Andrew Rens is a South African attorney, who previously taught both<br />
 intellectual property and information and communications technology<br />
 law at the University of the Witwatersrand, and led the license<br />
 drafting process.</p>
<p>The launch of the South African Creative Commons licenses occurred in<br />
 conjunction with a conference sponsored by the LINK Centre entitled<br />
 â€œCommons Sense: Towards an African Digital Information Commons.â€<br />
 Project leads from Creative Commons Brazil, Ronaldo Lemos, and<br />
 Creative Commons India, Lawrence Liang, presented on the topic of<br />
 â€œOpen Content for the Developing World.â€ Creative Commons CEO &<br />
 Chairman, Lawrence Lessig also presented at the conference on the<br />
 topic of the â€œGlobal Momentum towards the Commons.â€</p>
<p>â€œSouth Africa, along with Brazil, will prove to be the one of the most<br />
 important opportunities for the spread of Creative Commons,â€ said<br />
 Lawrence Lessig of the South African launch, â€œAlready the energy and<br />
 awareness is far beyond anything we could have expected.â€</p>
