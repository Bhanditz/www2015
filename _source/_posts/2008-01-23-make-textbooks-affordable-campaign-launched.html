<p>It was a busy day yesterday for campaigns to open up educational access and opportunities. In addition to the <a href="http://www.capetowndeclaration.org">Cape Town Declaration</a>, the <a href="http://www.studentpirgs.org/">Student PIRGs</a> in the United States just launched a major campaign to encourage faculty to adopt open educational resources in their classrooms, which will provide significant benefit to students in making college education more affordable. ccLearn and members of the Creative Commons board have been advising on this campaign, and of course the texts being recommended would carry a CC license.</p>
<p>A press release is below:</p>
<p><strong><em>January 22, 2008</em></strong>:  Textbook costs can be a huge financial burden on students, and considering new low-cost options can help keep higher education affordable and accessible.</p>
<p>Although most of the textbooks on the existing market are expensive, an emerging number of free, online, open-access textbooks presents one of our best hopes for more affordable, comparable options.  While the supply of these textbooks is still small, existing open textbooks have already won adoptions at some of the nation's most prestigious institutions, including Harvard and Caltech.  Instructors who use open textbooks have affirmed that high-quality textbooks are not necessarily expensive textbooks.</p>
<p>The statement below is an effort to build faculty interest and demand for affordable and still comparable course materials, including open textbooks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.maketextbooksaffordable.org/statement">http://www.maketextbooksaffordable.org/statement</a></p>
<p>Signers state their intent to consider open textbooks in the search for the most appropriate course materials, and their preference to adopt an open textbook in place of an expensive, commercial textbook, if the open textbook is the best option.</p>
<p>Please consider signing it!</p>
