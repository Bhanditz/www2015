<p>In response to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3681">ongoing discussion</a> of our licences' warranty provision, I've decided to raise the issue at our upcoming board meeting.</p>
<p>Meantime, please keep fleshing out what you think our approach to warranties should be.  The how is as important as the why.  Is there any disadvantage to making a quitclaim-style warranty optional (as opposed to the standard)? Do you think we should have <em>some</em> type of warranty in the licenses, or rather abandon the idea altogether?</p>
<p>Soon we can move the conversation over to our forthcoming Discuss page, where we'll host a variety of archived email lists dedicated to public development of innovations, license versions, iCommons, and more. For now, please keep posting your comments here.  And thanks.</p>
