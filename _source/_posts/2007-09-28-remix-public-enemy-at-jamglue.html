<p>Jamglue is back with <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/contests/publicenemy">another amazing remix contest</a>, this time featuring revolutionary hip-hop act <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_%28band%29">Public Enemy</a> and their song "Amerikan Gangster". From Jamglue:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Public Enemy's] revolutionary grouping of groundbreaking soundscapes with decidedly political lyrics made Public Enemy, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the most controversial, influential, and authoritative hardcore rap formation of the late eighties, early nineties. For many, Chuck D. and his crew to this day remain the most definitive rap group of all time, as they have not only made a massive, cultural impact on black society, but had an almost equally significant, conscience-rousing effect on all people of different colors and backgrounds across the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Public Enemy has long been ahead of the curve in their approach to music in the digital age. They were one of the first hip-hop groups to go <a href="http://publicenemy.com/">live on the web</a>, Frontman Chuck D has <a href="http://www.rapstation.com/promo/lars_vs_chuckd.html">debated Metallica's Lars Ulrich on The Charlie Rose show</a> over file-sharing, and he has appeared on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">The WIRED CD</a> with Fine Arts Militia. In getting involved with Jamglue (who release the song as separate instrument tracks, all of which are released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>), Public Enemy allows their fans the ability to remix their music as they see fit - a wonderful, yet logical, step in their forward-thinking digital endeavors.</p>
