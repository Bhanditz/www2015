</a><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18166">Almost a month ago we launched</a> the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/">2009 fundraising campaign</a>, with the goal of raising $500,000 by the end of the year. Despite the daunting economic climate, we've set our goal high, and we'll need everyone who cares about CC to pitch in whatever they can. So, in order to make your dollar go a little farther when you give a gift to CC, we've teamed up with our friends at <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, who'll generously <strong> match every donation dollar for dollar </strong> for the next week - up to $3,000! <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">Donate now</a></strong> to help us meet the challenge!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu project, was founded in 2004. The headquarters are in Europe, with over 200 employees working in 23 countries. Their mission is "to realize the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations," which they do by delivering the world's best software platform and ensuring its availability to everyone. </p>
<p>From Jono Bacon, Canonical's Ubuntu Community Manager: "<em>Canonical are really happy to support the Creative Commons, an organization at the corner-stone of an ethos that we share in the Ubuntu world and that we are proud to support.</em>" Likewise, we feel that Canonical's mission could not be better aligned with our own, and as such we're thrilled to partner with them on on this matching challenge. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">Join Canonical in investing in the future of creativity and knowledge and give what you can today</a>!</strong></p>
