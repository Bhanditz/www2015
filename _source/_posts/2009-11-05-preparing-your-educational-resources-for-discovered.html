<p><a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/cclearn-step-by-step-discovered.pdf"><img class="size-medium wp-image-19056 alignleft" title="Preparing Your Educational Resources for DiscoverEd" src="img/ded-sbs-231x300.jpg" alt="ded-sbs" width="178" height="231" /></a>In July, CC Learn <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15486">officially launched</a> <a href="http://discovered.creativecommons.org">DiscoverEd</a>, a search prototype that provides scalable search and discovery for educational resources on the web. We blogged about it again during <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17451">Back to School</a> week, emphasizing the future of search and discovery of educational resources and how we hoped DiscoverEd would catalyze efforts in that direction. Since then, we have been working with various organizations and projects who want to include their resources into DiscoverEd, and through all the back and forth about feeds and mark-up--essentially what's required to get your stuff included for greater discovery--we realized we could streamline the process by putting some necessary information into a brief document.</p>
<p><a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/cclearn-step-by-step-discovered.pdf">Preparing Your Educational Resources for DiscoverEd</a> is second in the <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/productions/#Step%20by%20Step%20Guides">CC Learn Step by Step Guides series</a>, which is part of our larger <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/productions">Productions</a> schema. It is a basic guide for those interested in preparing their resources for inclusion into search engines like DiscoverEd that utilize structured data. It is targeted at people or institutions interested in making their digitally published educational resources more discoverable. Though the document contains technical language and sample XHTML and RDFa, it's really not all too complicated. Basically, you just need one of the right feeds to start, which you can then copy and paste the link of into <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/ODEPO">ODEPO</a> (the Open Database of Educational Projects and Organizations). ODEPO is hosted on <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/">OpenED</a>, the community site for open education. It's a wiki, so anyone can <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&amp;returnto=Main_Page">create</a> an account and <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Special:AddData/Organization">add their project or organization</a> to the database.</p>
<p>But the guide explains all that, (as does the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/DiscoverEd_FAQ">DiscoverEd FAQ</a>) and the alternatives--which include <a href="mailto:cclearn-info@creativecommons.org">contacting</a> us directly. DiscoverEd already pulls from a <a href="http://discovered.creativecommons.org/search/browse/">number</a> of institutions and repositories, and as it expands we hope to improve its search capabilities. Any feedback is welcome.</p>
