<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/salon">CC Salon San Francisco</a> is going bi-monthly. The next Salon will be in February featuring speakers from Flickr and BitTorrent.</p>
<p>There's a close substitute in January.  Check out NetSquared's <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/137730/">Net Tuesday featuring the Public Library of Science</a>, Tuesday, January 9 from 6-8PM at Citizen Space, 425 Second St., #300 in San Francisco:<br />
<blockquote>This month our two presenters will be from <a href="http://plos.org">PLoS</a>, The Public Library of Science. PLoS is a nonprofit organization of scientists and physicians committed to making the world's scientific and medical literature a freely available public resource. PLoS is both an open-access advocate and an online publisher that publishes several peer-reviewed biomedical journals under the Creative Commons Attribution License. PLoS collaborates with Topaz in the development of open-source software to facilitate community-based annotation of scientific articles.</p></blockquote>
