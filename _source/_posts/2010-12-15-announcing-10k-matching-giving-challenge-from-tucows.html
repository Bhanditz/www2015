We just received the exciting news that <a href="http://www.tucows.com/">Tucows</a>, a company that started offering free downloads of shareware and freeware on the Internet in 1993, will take part in a matching challenge of up to $10,000. This means that whatever you donate right now will automatically be doubled. We need your help to meet their challenge and turn $10,000 into $20,000 for CC.</p>
<p>Here's why Tucows supports CC:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"We support Creative Commons because all of our business philosophy is based on the open Internet. For the Internet to really flourish and remain an open, healthy, and great platform for innovation, we need to adapt old sets of rules to new paradigms. Creative Commons is one of the first and best examples of that." -Elliot Noss, President and CEO</p></blockquote>

As we approach the end of the year, I invite you to think about how creativity and openness have affected your life. How much would you give to see a future filled with sharing? If you've supported CC already this year, would you be willing to give again knowing that your gift will be automatically doubled?</p>
