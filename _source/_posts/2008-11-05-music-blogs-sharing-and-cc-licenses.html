<p>A <a href="http://drownedinsound.com/news/4135551">recent post</a> on music blogs and MP3 distribution at UK webzine <a href="http://drownedinsound.com/">Drowned In Sound</a> raised some interesting questions about the legality of sharing online and caught our attention as a result. The posting focused on the case of blog <a href="http://www.berkeleyplaceblog.com/">Berkeley Place Indie</a> (now <em>Berkeley Place</em>) that, like many music blogs, posted free MP3s of artists and songs that they liked. Beyond the legal questions involved in this practice, BPI's owner claims that it was done under <a href="http://www.berkeleyplaceblog.com/2008/10/28/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/">the assumption</a> that they had both artist and record label blessing to do so. </p>
<p>When BPI found that a number of their posts had been either removed or made private by their hosts, a messy and complex ownership battle <a href="http://www.berkeleyplaceblog.com/2008/10/28/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/">emerged</a>. DiS summed up the details nicely, and provided some <a href="http://drownedinsound.com/news/4135551">unique insight as well</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rumblings suggest that this blogger is not alone, and that a whole host of posts are being taken down.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It's all quite crazy and confusing, like most copyright laws in this highly globalised, anything-goes-until-a-precedent-is-set mad world in which we live. Unless there are sensible solutions, such as bandwidth taxes for data transfer or for owning an internet connection and/or a computer, this confusion will continue, embracing technology that can do things will be a minefield and technological creativity will be stifled or more likely forced further underground. It's such a muddle, even people doing legitimate things will be thrown in with every album leaker."</p></blockquote>
<p>The CC answer to this problem is relatively simple - even our most restrictive license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>) allows for the <strong>sharing of content</strong>. Record labels and artists can indicate, in advance, which songs they wish blogs to distribute - not just in a passing manner, but with a legally sound license that works to protect all parties involved. Music blogs, in turn, gain the insurance that these sort of takedowns won't take place - legally speaking, our licenses are irrevocable, making a commitment to sharing legally and technically binding.</p>
<p>The issue is of course isn't as simple as it sounds. From a legal perspective, international copyright law remains a point of confusion (as it was with BPI), a haze we are adding clarity to by offering <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/">jurisdiction specificity</a> for our licenses. A similar complication arises in from the murky question of what commercial use is and what it isn't - another issue we are attempting to tackle through our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/9554">noncommercial use study</a>. </p>
<p>Regardless of these questions, for artists and record labels looking to distribute songs to music blogs under terms that allow sharing, CC licenses are a great option for all parties. They are legally tested, easy to understand, and free.</p>
