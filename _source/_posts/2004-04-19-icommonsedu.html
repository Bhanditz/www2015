<p>I had the chance to speak about Creative Commons yesterday at the <a href="http://larcnet.sdsu.edu/ticfia.php">Technological Innovation and Cooperation for Foreign Information Access Conference</a> (TICFIA) at San Diego State University. With the support of the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/index.jhtml">US Dept. of Education</a>, the group is up to <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/iegpsticfia/index.html">some innovative and interesting things</a> on education across borders via the Net. Some great <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">iCommons</a> leads will surely come out of the meeting. Thanks again to my hosts from <a href="http://sdsu.edu/">SDSU</a>, the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/index.jhtml">Dept. of Education</a>.</p>
