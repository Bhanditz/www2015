The Pew Internet Project <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/reports/toc.asp?Report=123">released a report today</a>, which surveyed musicians and internet users. While the downloading habits portion of the results were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/03/business/media/03MOSTWANTED.html?ex=1399003200&amp;en=80ddd7416072af74&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">covered in the NY Times today</a>, the most compelling statistic from the artist report was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
83% [of musicians] have provided free samples of their work online and significant numbers say free downloading has helped them sell CDs and increase the crowds at concerts
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That's great to hear, and it's my hope these same musicians come to understand how Creative Commons can help them share their samples and also let fans rip, mix, and burn, while still increasing CD and ticket sales.</p>
