<p><a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org">ccLearn</a>, the educational division of Creative Commons, was launched in Fall, 2007. Since then, we have been very busy setting priorities and managing a few key projects, such as the <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/projects/oesearch">(Open) Education Search</a> project and helping with the <a href="http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/">Cape Town Open Education Declaration</a>. In the meantime, we have been putting together plans and materials for a number of other initiatives, many of which are already listed on our <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/projects">Projects</a> page. In addition, we have been drafting materials to help educators and learners understand the ideas that lie behind open education, and in particular the ways that Creative Commons licenses interface with that movement.</p>
<p><a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org">The site</a> is under heavy construction, but expect to see it fill in quickly. You can <a href="http://creativecommons.org/category/cclearn/feed">sign up for a feed</a> if you want to stay abreast of changes, and you can sign up for the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-learn">ccLearn listserv</a> if you want news and events related to ccLearn sent to you via email. And of course, you should always feel free to contact us with comments, suggestions, and anything else that you would like to share.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#cclearn">staff</a> at ccLearn are looking forward to a busy and exciting year. Welcome!</p>
