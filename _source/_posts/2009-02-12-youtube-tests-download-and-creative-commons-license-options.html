<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=Mp1pWVLh3_Y"><img src="img/youtubelogo2.gif" alt="youtubelogo2" title="youtubelogo2" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12764" height="30" width="80" /></a>YouTube just made an incredibly exciting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=Mp1pWVLh3_Y">announcement</a>: it's testing an option that gives video owners the ability to allow downloads and share their work under Creative Commons licenses. The test is being launched with a handful of partners, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/stanforduniversity">Stanford</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dukeuniversitynews">Duke</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ucberkeley">UC Berkeley</a>, <a href="http://youtube.com/user/uclacourses">UCLA</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/uctelevision">UCTV</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are always looking for ways to make it easier for you to find, watch, and share videos. Many of you have told us that you wanted to take your favorite videos offline. So we've started working with a few partners who want their videos shared universally and even enjoyed away from an Internet connection.</p>
<p>Many video creators on YouTube want their work to be seen far and wide. They don't mind sharing their work, provided that they get the proper credit. Using <a href="../about/licenses/">Creative Commons licenses</a>, we're giving our partners and community more choices to make that happen. Creative Commons licenses permit people to reuse downloaded content under certain conditions.</p></blockquote>
