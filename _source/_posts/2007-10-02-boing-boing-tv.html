<p>From Boing Boing, one of the most popular blogs on the planet, and the one that more often than not scoops us (we don't mind) on cool new content released under CC licenses: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/10/02/boing-boing-tv-same.html">Boing Boing tv</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently the lowercase "tv" is intentional, and yes, it's licensed under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial</a>.</p>
