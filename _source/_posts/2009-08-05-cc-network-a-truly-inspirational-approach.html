<p>Chris Messina on <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/08/05/openid-the-unseen-branded-revenue-opportunity/">OpenID: the unseen branded revenue opportunity</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>What better way to both support <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://creativecommons.net/h/about/">show off your patronage</a> than by identifying yourself across the web with your very own unique, secure, <a href="https://creativecommons.net/h/openid/">privacy-protecting</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.net">creativecommons.net</a> OpenID (just like <a href="https://creativecommons.net/zach/">Zach Beauvais</a>)? </p>
<p>For a mere <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=20">$50 minimum donation </a>(<a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=16">$25 for students</a>), you can own a limited edition URL and profile from Creative Commons that identifies you to the world and provides a compelling revenue opportunity for the non-profit foundation.</p>
<p>While companies like <a href="http://sap.com">SAP</a> <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/15037" title="We are open for OpenID!">become OpenID providers</a> for pedestrian reasons like <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/15183" title="OpenID comes to SAP">simplifying authentication across their many different distributed web properties</a>, Creative Commons is redistributing the brand equity and social capital their members have accrued over the last several years by letting people show and verify their affiliation to the organization.</p>
<p>With this simple example, we can start to see the symbiosis of making an <em>intentional</em> choice about identity: Creative Commons finds a new revenue opportunity and members of the community have a way to express their affiliation and promote the brand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perfectly explained. Do read <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/08/05/openid-the-unseen-branded-revenue-opportunity/">the whole post</a>, including the part where Messina calls CC Network "a truly inspirational approach". Thanks Chris!</p>

<p>CC Network also has other features that complement its identity and affiliation stories -- see our posts from last fall <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10001">launching the service</a>, explaining <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11223">our technical approach to CC Network's OpenID security</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10043">CC Network and web-centric copyright registries</a>. On the last, see our CTO Nathan Yergler's recent <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nyergler/cc-technology-summit-3-update">update</a> from the third CC technology summit.</p>
