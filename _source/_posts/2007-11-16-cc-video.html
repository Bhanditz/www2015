<p>There has been quite a lively exchange of emails on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contact#discussion">community discussion list</a> concerning the idea of CC+ that CC CEO Lawrence Lessig <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7693">mentioned on our blog</a> a little over a month ago. To shed some light on the concept, we <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/videos#ccp">posted a new video</a> that explains CC+ more fully. In short, CC+ is how CC licenses can work in tandem with commercial arrangements. </p>
<p>The core of this idea is based around the non-exclusivity of our licence suite. While you may use a specific CC-license for the wide distribution of your work, there is nothing prohibiting you from entering into a separate license that allows for uses not offered by the CC license (for example, working out a one off deal that would allow for commercial use of a CC BY-NC work).</p>
<p>So go ahead, check it out, and let us know what you think (and don't forget that we have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/ccvideos/">other videos up as well</a>). </p>
