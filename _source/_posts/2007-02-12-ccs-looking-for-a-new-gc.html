<p>I am moving on, so Creative Commons needs a new General Counsel.  The description of the job and its requirements is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#gc">here</a>.  If you are experienced in intellectual property law (with a liking for copyright issues) and want to be involved in an organization that will give you unique opportunities and a chance to be part of trying (and succeeding) to change the debate about copyright law and digital technologies, then this is the job for you.  Or maybe you know someone who meets this description, in which case please pass on the details.</p>
