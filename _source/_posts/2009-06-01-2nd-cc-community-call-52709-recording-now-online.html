<p>We hosted our second community conference call last Wednesday, May 27. Donors were invited to join members of CC's staff and board, including CEO <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#22">Joi Ito</a> and new Board Chair <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#105">Esther Wojcicki</a>, to discuss organizational updates, including CC Zero, GreenXchange, the future of the CC Network, and an update on the Wikipedia migration to CC BY-SA. We also took questions and comments from participants. The call was a great success and a valuable opportunity to reach out to and connect with our supporters; we will continue to host community conference calls on a quarterly basis, and anyone <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">giving $250 or more</a> will be invited to take part.</p>
<p>An audio recording of the call is <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/cc-community-call-2009-q2">now available online</a>. Thanks to everyone who participated, and as always, we would like to extend a big thank you to all members of our community for your continued support!</p>
