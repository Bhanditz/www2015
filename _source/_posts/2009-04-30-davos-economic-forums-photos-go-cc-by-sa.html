There's great news over at the<a href="http://www.forumblog.org/blog/2009/04/forum-photos-on-flickr-under-creative-commons-licence.html"> Davos World Economic Forum blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have just uploaded 300 of our best pictures from the Annual Meeting 2009 in Davos to the World Economic Forum's Flickr account. Admittedly it took us some time to choose the best pictures from the thousands shot by our official photographers from Swiss-Image. My colleague Dafni Kokkidi spent the past week adding descriptions, tags and geo tags to all the photos. But it was well worth it, because <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldeconomicforum">these 300 high-resolution portrait shots are available for anyone to download in all sizes</a>. Best of all, these pictures are licensed under the Creative Commons licence (BY-SA 3.0) meaning you can use them for free on your blog, on your website, in print and even for commercial purposes under the condition that you credit the World Economic Forum. We also uploaded the best pictures from our regional summits such as the recent World Economic Forum on Latin America in Rio.</p></blockquote>
<p> Many of these photos have already made their way over to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&ns0=1&ns6=1&ns9=1&ns11=1&redirs=0&search=worldeconomicforum&limit=500&offset=0">Wikimedia Commons and Wikipedia</a>, so they'll probably be making an appearance in your favorite world leader's article soon. Thanks to Davos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldeconomicforum">for their substantial contribution to the commons</a>!</p>
