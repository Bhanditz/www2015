<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/rick">Rick Prelinger</a>, of the <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/prelinger.php">Prelinger Archives</a>, got <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/12/opinion/L12FILE.html">his letter to the editor</a> published in today's New York Times. In it he points to the positive free distribution aspects of digitizing and sharing his works under the public domain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our experience may seem counterintuitive, but it has been overwhelmingly positive: the more we give away, the more we actually sell.</p></blockquote>
