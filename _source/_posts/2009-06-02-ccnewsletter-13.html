Note that from here out, the format of our newsletter will be changing slightly. We'll send brief monthly e-news updates of the latest CC news, and on a quarterly basis, starting in September, we'll produce a more comprehensive newsletter including a CEO update from Joi Ito, which will also be available in  PDF format. We've got a lot of exciting things happening all the time, and we want to be sure to bring all of our big news to you in the most convenient way possible!</p>
