<p>Itâ€™s <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35773">been a long time</a> since we last wrote about the ongoing discussion of the NonCommercial and NoDerivatives licenses. Recall that last year <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33874">CC heard suggestions</a> that it should stop offering NC and ND licenses in future versions of our license suite because these licenses do not create a true commons of open content that everyone is free to use, redistribute, remix, and repurpose. </p>
<p>The CC community <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/NC_ND_discussion#Why_not_something_more_radical.3F">agreed</a> to not make such a radical change as to stop offering the NC or ND licenses in the soon-to-be-released <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0/Drafts#Draft_4_Details">4.0 licenses</a>, or to spin off those licenses to another host organization. However, as promised, we have been working on several projects to help explain and clarify these issues to license users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weâ€™ve <a href="https://creativecommons.org/freeworks">improved information</a> about which CC licenses align with definitions of â€œFree licenses.â€</li>
<p></p>
<li>Weâ€™ve reinstated a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/examples">color-coded license spectrum graphic</a> and provided <a href="https://creativecommons.org/examples#cc0">descriptive examples</a> of adopters of both Free and non-free licenses.</li>
<p></p>
<li>We <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Commercial_Rights_Reserved">gathered feedback</a> about changing the name of â€œNonCommercialâ€ to â€œCommercial Rights Reservedâ€ and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36725">decided</a> that the name will stay at â€œNonCommercial.â€</li>
</ul>
