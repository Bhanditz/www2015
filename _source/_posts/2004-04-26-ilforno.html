<p><a href="http://ilforno.typepad.com/il_forno/">Il Forno</a> is a baking weblog based in Germany that is licensed under Creative Commons. There are many recipes posted, especially in <a href="http://ilforno.typepad.com/il_forno/bread/index.html">the bread making category</a> and when you consider the way recipes are passed from one generation to the next, it would seem that Creative Commons licenses would be a natural for cooking communities online. Just as my own grandmother "remixed" her mother's special recipes and passed them on to my mother, aunts, and uncles, where they each modified and perfected them before passing along to me, it'd be cool to see a virtual cookbook form on the web based around CC-licensed works. </p>
<p>The Il Forno blog is licensed under a No Derivatives license, but I'm pretty sure you still make substitutions when baking the bread recipes found there. :)</p>
