About a year ago we learned that the innovative art purveyors behind the <a href="http://www.20x200.com">20x200 Project</a> had partnered with designer <a href="http://magicalnihilism.com/2009/11/07/get-excited-and-make-things/">Matt Jones</a> to release Get Excited and Make Things, and that <strong>all proceeds were to go to CC</strong>. We thought this was the coolest way for our friends and fans to support art and Creative Commons both - and have an exhibition-quality print to show for it! Turns out they felt the same way: a year later, Creative Commons has received a total of $13,490 from the edition, which has nearly sold out.</p>
<p>Good news! You can still <a href="http://www.20x200.com/art/2009/04/get-excited-and-make-things.html">get your very own print</a> while at the same time showing some love for CC. There remain only 139 of the original 730 prints (varying sizes), so get one today and help us sell out the edition. If you've been looking for an opportunity to support CC, this is it!</p>
<p>This is just one of the many, many ways you can show support for the organization that has helped you and thousands of other excited makers of things tap into and become a vital part of the creativity and innovation that surround all of us on the web. <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org">Donate</a>, shop at our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/store">online store</a>, follow us on <a href="http://twitter.com/creativecommons">Twitter</a>, join us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/creativecommons">Facebook</a>, and ensure Creative Commons is around for as long as creative, scientific, academic, and entrepreneurial minds need us.</p>
