<p>The New York Times has reignited its <a href="http://pollingplaces.nytimes.com/content.cfm/home" title="Polling Place Photo Project">Polling Place Photo Project</a>, a "nationwide experiment in citizen journalism that encourages voters to capture, post and share photographs of this yearâ€™s primaries, caucuses and general election." All participant photos are published under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/" title="CC BY-ND">Attribution No Derivatives</a> license. This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to the author.</p>
<p>Alongside the photos, contributors are encouraged to submit additional information like polling place descriptions, voting conditions and personal experiences. The Times says, "By documenting local voting experiences, participants can contribute to an archive of photographs that captures the richness and complexity of voting in America."
