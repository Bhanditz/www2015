<p><strong>â€œA Story of Healingâ€ Becomes First Academy AwardÂ® Winning Film Released Under A Creative Commons License</strong></p>
<p>April 19, 2007</p>
<p>Interplast â€” the first humanitarian organization to provide free reconstructive surgery for children with clefts, disabling burns, and hand injuries â€” is proud to announce that its 1997 Academy AwardÂ® winning documentary, â€œA Story of Healing,â€ has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommerical-No Derivatives license. This marks the first time in history that an Academy AwardÂ® winning film has been licensed under any Creative Commons license, allowing free and legal distribution of the film via the Internet.</p>
<p>â€œInterplast hopes that by licensing â€˜A Story of Healingâ€™ in such a way, anyone with Internet access can watch this moving film and learn more about the need for surgical care in developing countries,â€ said Susan W. Hayes, Interplast president and CEO.</p>
<p>Interplast believes that greater public access to information about humanitarian issues will bring increased awareness to global need and hopefully persuade people to want to help. For this reason, Interplast also has posted thousands of photos from developing world countries on Flickr and dozens of videos on blip.tv, all under a Creative Commons by-nc-nd license. The international organization also encourages other nonprofits to publish their various media under Creative Commons licenses, so that the public can more easily learn about various causes and solutions worldwide.</p>
<p>Creative Commons, American Public Television, and blip.tv were instrumental in helping Interplast provide worldwide, free distribution of the filmâ€™s powerful message. Interplast is deeply grateful for their help.</p>
<p>â€œThis film is a tremendous asset for Interplastâ€”to the extent it is seen. We're happy that a Creative Commons license can help with that. Other mission-driven organizations should take note,â€ said Lawrence Lessig, Creative Commons CEO.</p>
<p>To view â€œA Story of Healing,â€ visit <a href="http://interplast.org/astoryofhealing.php">interplast.org/astoryofhealing.php</a>. A DVD version of the film may also be obtained on the Interplast website.</p>
