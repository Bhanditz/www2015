<p>Today marks the official launch of the 2011 Creative Commons Annual Campaign! Please <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement">join us</a> in powering the future of openness!</p>
<p>This year, we are offering a limited teal edition of the CC â€œI love to shareâ€ t-shirt to everyone who <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement">donates</a> $50 or more (until supplies run out). For those who <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement">donate</a> $300 or more, in addition to the t-shirt, we are offering beautiful hard copy editions of <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement">The Power of Open</a>, stories of creators sharing knowledge, art, and data using Creative Commons.</p>
<p>The world is experiencing an explosion of openness. From artists inviting creative collaboration to governments around the world requiring publicly funded works be available to everyone, the spirit and practice of sharing is gaining momentum and producing results. We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement">post</a> about these results frequently; subscribe to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/newsletter?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement">CC newsletter</a> for a distilled monthly rundown.</p>
<p>Creative Commons relies on donations to build and constantly improve the technical and legal tools that enable openness to flourish. The future of openness is bright, but ensuring that future requires urgent and sustained effort. CC is continuing to improve the usefulness of our licenses and helping even more artists, institutions and governments share their works. We are reaching a critical mass and need <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement">your support</a> now more than ever. </p>
