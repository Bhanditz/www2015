<p><a href="http://blocsonic.com/"><img src="img/BSCOMP0001-Cover.jpg" alt="blocsonic cover art" border="0" align="right" /></a>blocSonic is a new thing (blog or compilations label, you decide -- a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7175">tastemaker</a> in any case) that has just <a href="http://blocsonic.com/">posted its first compliation of CC-licensed music</a>. From the release's 36 page CD booklet:<br />
<blockquote>One problem... the sheer quantity of netlabel releases and no simple way of sifting through it all to find the gems. Thatâ€™s where blocSonic and our netBloc releases come in. Admittedly not a solution to the problem, our netBloc releases are a but a tiny-step in the direction of a future solution that we intend to develop and launch. For the time-being let our monthly releases help you shine some light on deserving artists/netlabels and the terrific music that they have to offer. Help us usher in a new era by regularly downloading our releases and then checking out the featured artistsâ€™ and labelsâ€™ websites for more from them.</p></blockquote>
