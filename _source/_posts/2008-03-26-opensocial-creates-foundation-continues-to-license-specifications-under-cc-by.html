<p>Yesterday Google, MySpace, and newest partner Yahoo! announced the formation of the <a href="http://www.opensocial.org/" title="OpenSocial Foundation">OpenSocial Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization that works  "to ensure the neutrality and longevity of OpenSocial as an open, community-governed specification for building social applications across the web." From the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The foundation will provide transparency and operational guidelines around technology, documentation, intellectual property, and other issues related to the evolution of the OpenSocial platform, while also ensuring all stakeholders share influence over its future direction.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/" title="OpenSocial">OpenSocial</a> continues to release  all specifications under a Creative Commons         <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" title="CC BY 2.5">Attribution</a> license.</p>
<p>OpenSocial defines a common API (application programming interface) for social applications across multiple websites. OpenSocial helps developers avoid reinventing the wheel by "providing common 'plumbing' that lets social applications run on many different websites without requiring duplicate work from either developers or the websites."</p>
