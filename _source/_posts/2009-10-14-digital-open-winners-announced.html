<p>I blogged about the <a href="http://digitalopen.org/">Digital Open</a> in April, a new online community and competition that was accepting free and open technology projects from anyone 17 or younger through August. The competition was aimed at fostering an online and open community of youth by encouraging them to see the benefits of open source and open licensing.</p>
<p>Since then the jury has come in to <a href="http://digitalopen.org/news/digital-open-winners-announced">announce</a> eight grand prize winners. The first video profile is the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/13/digital-open-winners.html">Centralized Student Website</a> from Fremont, California, by Raymond Zhong and Aatash Parikh. They've gone ahead and built a student portal for their high school, where virtually any school activity, especially student clubs, are accessed. Other winners include a <a href="http://www.digitalopen.org/projects/casa-ecologica-autosuficiente-cea">Casa Ecologica</a> in Spain and a <a href="http://www.digitalopen.org/projects/hybrid-airship">Hybrid Airship</a>. Be sure to <a href="http://digitalopen.org/news/digital-open-winners-announced">check back</a> for more videos.</p>
