<p><img src="img/CC-1-titles.jpg" alt="carpool_conversations" title="carpool_conversations" width="300" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" /><em><a href="http://pinkcloudevents.com/blog/2009/07/our-first-video-series-carpool-convos-episode-1-of-3/">Carpool Conversations</a></em> is a newly launched video series from LA-based <a href="http://pinkcloudevents.com/">Pink Cloud Events</a>. Produced in collaboration with <a href="http://www.honda.com/">Honda</a>, the 3-part series aims to capture intimate and unexpected conversations between strangers sharing a ride in a <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/insight-hybrid/">Honda Insight</a>. While the topics vary from episode to episode, a common thread through out is the importance of sharing experiences - a concept that resonates strongly with CC's mission.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://pinkcloudevents.com/blog/2009/07/our-first-video-series-carpool-convos-episode-1-of-3/">first episode</a> finds members of LA-based fruit finding collaborative <a href="http://fallenfruit.org/">Fallen Fruit</a> and Damien Somerset of green video site <a href="http://zaproot.com/">Zaproot</a> discussing the merits of hybrid cars, free fruit, and a variety of other topics. This sharing of information extends beyond the car ride as <em>Carpool Conversations</em> is released under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative license</a>, allowing the video to be legally and openly shared across the web.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this is just the first in a delightful series - the next episode of <em>Carpool Conversations</em> features Top Chef Master contestant, Elizabeth Falkner of <a href="http://www.orsonsf.com/team.html">Orson/Citizen Cake</a>, community manager Michelle Broderick of <a href="http://yelp.com/">yelp.com</a>, and tech-chocolate maker Timothy Childs of <a href="http://tcho.com/">tcho.com</a>.</p>
