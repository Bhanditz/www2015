<p>The <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=OER_Community">UNESCO OER Community</a> attempts to put OER in light of not one, but many cultural contexts around the world. Connecting 900 individuals in 109 countries, the community runs on a wiki platform and communicates centrally via its listserv. Earlier this year in February and March, they held a discussion on the various barriers to accessing OER in different jurisdictions, with one of its ultimate aims to develop concrete proposals in this area. The outcomes of the discussion are now compiled into a <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=Access2OER/Contents">report</a> in both PDF and wiki versions.</p>
<p>From the announcement by Bjoern Hassler,</p>
<blockquote><p>"The first proposal is about "Introducing digital Open Educational<br />
Resources into Zambian primary schools through school-based<br />
professional development". Through this project we seek to overcome<br />
access barriers, and engage with OER for Zambian primary/secondary<br />
school mathematics teaching. The barriers are manifold, including<br />
infrastructural, awareness, appropriateness of materials, etc, but we<br />
hope that we'll be able to draw on the various experiences and<br />
solutions to make this successful... Further information is available here<br />

<p>The second outcome is continued engagement through the UK National<br />
Commission for UNESCO. Within the Information Society Working Group,<br />
OER has been a long-standing theme. However, based on the experience<br />
of the discussion, we are now focussing on issues around OER access<br />
and collaboration. The aims for this are concrete: We are running a<br />
series of meetings to further focus on feasible projects in this area.<br />
The first meeting will take place on 25th/26th in conjunction with the<br />
Nottingham Open Learning Conference (<br />
http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/olc/ ) and in conjunction with OER Africa<br />
( http://www.oerafrica.org )."</p></blockquote>
