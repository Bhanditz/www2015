<p>It's that time of year again! That is, time for planning the line-up for Open Ed 2009, the annual, international Open Education Conference, hosted this year by the University of British Columbia in breathtaking Vancouver, Canada. From the conference website (<a href="http://openedconference.org/">OpenEd 2009: Crossing the Chasm</a>):</p>
<p>"The field of â€œopen educationâ€ is in its second decade. There is ever more interest from new participants, with all the questions and challenges that such involvement brings. Existing projects must now address long-term issues of sustainability and accountability. And early adopters, who once made colleagues gape dumbfounded when they talked of freely sharing their content  are asking a new generation of questions that induce unbelieving stares.</p>
<p>In recognition of the different needs of participants in these various stages of innovation in Open Ed, this yearâ€™s Call for Proposals is organized around these three broad â€œstrands." "</p>
<p>The three strands are<br />
1. Open Ed - Startup Camp<br />
2. Open Ed - Sustaining Steps<br />
3. Open Ed - The Future</p>
<p>For more information on the strands, see the <a href="http://openedconference.org/call-for-papers">Call for Papers</a>. The deadline for your proposal is May 1, 2009, so you've got a month to brainstorm and submit your topic, project, or research. Thankfully, abstracts must be tweet-sized (150 characters or less) and all submissions (500 words or less) and presentations will be licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>.</p>
