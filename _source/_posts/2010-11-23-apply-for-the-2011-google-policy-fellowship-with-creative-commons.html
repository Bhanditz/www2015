<p>Weâ€™re happy to announce that for the third year Creative Commons will take part in the <a href="http://www.google.com/policyfellowship">Google Policy Fellowship</a> program.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Google Policy Fellowship program offers undergraduate, graduate, and law students interested in Internet and technology policy the opportunity to spend the summer contributing to the public dialogue on these issues, and exploring future academic and professional interests. Fellows will have the opportunity to work at public interest organizations at the forefront of debates on broadband and access policy, content regulation, copyright and trademark reform, consumer privacy, open government, and more.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#aureliaschultz">Aurelia Schultz</a> was Creative Commons' 2009 Fellow, andÂ worked on a project to analyze the WIPO development agenda in relation to its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/16620">affect on access to public domain materials</a>.Â She also developed draft strategic plans for CC's engagement with WIPO as well as outreach in Africa.Â Aurelia is now Counsel at Creative Commons.Â <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#talniv">Tal Niv</a> was CC's Fellow last summer, and she's been continuing work as a Research Analyst on a key investigation intoÂ <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23504">CC's welfare impact</a>. The 2011 Google Policy Fellow will receive a substantial grant to work at Creative Commonsâ€™ San Francisco office. Potential topics may include, but certainly not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing trends in license adoption, including identification and development of relevant metrics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Coordinating with counsel to critically analyze the current state of public domain policy in U.S. and abroad. Develop a framework to help Creative Commonsâ€™ deploy messaging regarding public domain policy in U.S. and abroad.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Researching how the contemporary discourse of copyright, sharing, reuse, and remix has been shaped over the last eight years as a result of the Creative Commons project.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Investigating new opportunities for Creative Commons implementation in â€˜uncontactedâ€™ communities, institutions, artists, and mediums.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Working with Creative Commonsâ€™ international community and jurisdiction project leads on projects, research, and outreach.</li>
</ul>
