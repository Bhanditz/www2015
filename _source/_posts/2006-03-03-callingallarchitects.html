<p>This call for architects may not be a prestigious as <a href="http://www.pritzkerprize.com/">The Pritzker Prize,</a> but it's not far from it. Creative Commons seeks a <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> enthusiast and builder ... see below.</p>
<p><b>Calling Designers, Builders and Scripters -- help Creative Commons set up its meeting place and multimedia gallery</b></p>
<p>Creativecommons.org now has a home base in Second Life, and the Commoners need your help building an inviting space for people to gather and share ideas and resources. If you are a designer, builder, or scripter willing to use your talents, then read on!</p>
<p>What We Need:<br />
<br />-The Commons: Gathering place for people interested in discussing Creative Commons and the Free Culture movement<br />
<br />-The Gallery: Multimedia gallery for displaying and distributing Creative Commons licensed art, video, and audio content<br />
<br />-Info "kiosk" to distribute info about Creative Commons<br />
<br />-Donation "jar" for making donations to creativecommons.org</p>
<p>What We'd Like:<br />
<br />We're looking for designs that are friendly and fun. What does â€˜The Commonsâ€™ mean to you? For aesthetic ideas, take a look at Creativecommons.org to get a feel for Creative Commons style, taste and color palette.<br />
<br />-The Commons: A meeting/hanging out place that invites conversation and inspires creativity. This is your space! A coffee house? Tree house? Hanging garden? Floating yurt?<br />
<br />-The Gallery: Incorporated into the Commons, or alongside it, should be a multimedia gallery that shows off the work of artists, musicians,writers, and film makers who use CC licenses.</p>
<p>What to Do:<br />
<br />-Visit the CC HQ land in Second Life at Mocis (18, 180, 41) and get a feel for the landscape.<br />
<br />-Send in samples of your previous builds and mock-ups of your ideas for the Creative Commons site. To do this, go into Second Life, take a snapshot and send a postcard to Francesca Babeli (francesca@creativecommons.org). Subject line should read: CCHQ Entry<br />
<br />-All entries must be received by 13 March 2006.</p>
<p>A Creativecommons.org panel will review proposals and contact designers.  In appreciation of these services, the chosen builders will be given a selection of Creative Commons schwag and a Linden dollar stipend.</p>
