<p>The developers of the amaroK media player for KDE have used the tracks from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">WIRED CD</a> as content for their demo <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/blog/archives/8-amaroK-LiveCD.html">Live CD</a>.  Boot the CD in a PC and you can try out armaroK with zero installation.  Great idea.  USB memory and hardware media player vendors take note -- you can ship your device with great music without asking for permission, because permission has alreaedy been granted.</p>
