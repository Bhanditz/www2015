<p>Last fall we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10969">posted about</a> the <a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/1bf/charts.php">One Billion Fans contest</a> run by the music website <a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/">TribeOfNoise</a>. Today the winner has been announced (<a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/press/pr/Press_005_Dereck_Rose_wins_OBF_contest.pdf">pdf press release</a>) -- <a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/dereckrose">Dereck Rose</a>, a Jamaican-born singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Dereck Rose, the jury-selected winner, and the other <a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/1bf/charts.php">top ten finalists</a> (I can actually recommend the top vote getter, <a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/Bleeemo">Bleeemo</a>)!</p>
<p>Also congratulations to TribeOfNoise for pulling off the contest. To be completely blunt, the site looks more crassly promotional than many sites hosting music under CC licenses. However, just as bluntly, there's a need for hard core promoters of freely licensed music (note that "hard core" modifies "promoters") -- judging by promotions for mass market music, that's needed for mass market success, and there's no reason freely licensed music shouldn't compete in such arenas.</p>
<p>TribeOfNoise is also more innovative on the licensing front than most sites. All music on the site is available under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a>.  Here's an explanation sent last month from Hessel van Oorschot, the site's "Chief of Noise":</p>
<blockquote><p>Artists like Moby, Nine Inch Nails and Radio Head made the first moves towards an alternative form of music distribution. A Dutch company called Tribe of Noise takes it one step further. At Tribe of Noise, composers upload their music under a Creative Commons license and allows companies to download, remix and commercially use the music FREE and 100% legal.</p>
<p>ARE THEY MAD?<br />
WHY DO MUSICIANS GIVE AWAY THEIR MUSIC FOR FREE TO COMPANIES?</p>
<p>â€œWhile the traditional music industry is still in the repressive mode by introducing digital rights management and sending out the watch dogs, we rather think in solutions for like-minded spiritsâ€, says Sandra Brandenburg, founder of Tribe of Noise. â€œIt was not difficult to find thousands of independent artists worldwide who believe in sharing their music, and who actually encourage fans and professionals to freely distribute and build upon their work.â€</p>
<p>â€œWe take the Darwinist approach; adapt and you will survive. So instead of resisting change and become extinct you want to embrace change. People are going to share music, so give them something to share. Simultaneously the artist builds an inner circle of valuable contacts. Game developers ($50 billion industry), advertisement agencies ($750 billion industry) and others are more than willing to pay for music. <em>Getting Exposure is the name of the game</em>.â€</p></blockquote>
