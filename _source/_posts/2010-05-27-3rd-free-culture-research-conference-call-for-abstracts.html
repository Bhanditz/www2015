<p>There are just <strong>10 days left</strong> to submit your extended abstract  for the 2010 <a href="http://wikis.fu-berlin.de/display/fcrc/Home">Free Culture  Research  Conference (FCRC)</a>, which will take place October 8-9, in  Berlin. The event follows <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/fcrw/Main_Page">last yearâ€™s  one-day workshop</a> at Harvard University and aims to further the  exciting, interdisciplinary discourse on Free Culture. We hope you'll  consider applying.</p>
<p>From the conference's Call for Abstracts:</p>
<p><strong>The 3rd Free Culture Research  Conference: Free Culture between Commons  and Markets: Approaching the Hybrid  Economy?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wikis.fu-berlin.de/display/fcrc/Home">The Free Culture Research Conference</a> presents a  unique opportunity  for scholars whose work contributes to the  promotion, study or criticism  of a Free Culture, to engage with a  multidisciplinary group of academic  peers and practitioners, identify  the most important research  opportunities and challenges, and attempt  to chart the future of Free  Culture.</p>
<p>This event builds upon the  successful <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/fcrw/Main_Page">workshop  held in 2009</a> at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman  Center for  Internet and Society at Harvard University</a>, organized  and attended  by renowned scholars and research institutions from the  US, Europe and  Asia. The <a href="http://commonsresearch.wikidot.com/">first  event</a> was held in Sapporo, Japan, in 2008, in conjunction with the  4th <a href="http://icommonssummit.org/">iCommons Summit</a>. This  yearâ€™s event  is larger in ambition and scope, to provide more time for  interaction  in joint as well as break-out sessions. It is hosted  jointly by the <a href="http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html">Free  University of  Berlin</a> and the <a href="http://www.mpifg.de/index_en.asp">Max Planck  Institute for the  Study of Societies</a> and will take place at October  8-9, 2010 at the  Free University Campus in Berlin, in collaboration  with <a href="http://communia-project.eu/">COMMUNIA</a>, the European  Network  on the digital public domain. Funding and support is also  provided by  the <a href="http://www.boell.de/service/home.html">Heinrich  BÃ¶ll  Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Given this yearâ€™s theme and the generous support  of the Free  Universityâ€™s School of Business and Economics, we encourage  submissions  at the interface of Free Culture and business, although we  welcome  submissions from any relevant discipline, will be inclusive  and will  maintain the interdisciplinary nature of the event, as in  previous  years. Enabled by new Internet technologies and innovative  legal  solutions, Free Culture prospers in the form of new business  models and  via commons-based peer production, thereby both challenging  and  complementing classic market institutions. Alongside business   perspectives, we expect that perspectives from law, IT, the social   sciences and humanities will help us develop a better understanding of   the challenges at hand, for individuals, business, law, the economy, and   society at large.</p>
<p><strong>Deadline for extended abstracts is June 7. </strong></p>
