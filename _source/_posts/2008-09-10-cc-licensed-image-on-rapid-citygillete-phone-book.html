<p>It certainly isn't the most publicized use of CC licences we have seen, but Scott Carpenter's "<a href="http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2006/11/03/photos-south-dakota-black-hills-custer-state-park-free-wallpaper/">Slyvan Sunset</a>" <a href="http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2008/09/01/the-phone-book-is-here/#comment-3651">appearing on the cover of the 2008/2009 Rapid City/Gillete Phone Book</a> has us ecstatic nonetheless. While <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8095">big</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9226">names</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8476">help</a> gain wider exposure for CC, it is important to remember that these are tools meant for <em>everyone</em>, of which Carpenter's photo re-use is an excellent example. From <a href="http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2008/09/01/the-phone-book-is-here/">MTF.org</a><span style="LOL"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last September I received an email from someone at Yellowbook, saying that they were interested in using my picture for the cover of the Rapid City phone book [...] I said that they were already free and welcome to use it under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license with which it was published, but that Iâ€™d be willing to relicense it as Attribution only, which I did, and also signed a form giving them permission to use it. I often wondered if I should have held out for money also, but seeing the small role of the picture, itâ€™s just as well I didnâ€™t. Something tells me they wouldnâ€™t have paid much for that, if anything, and Iâ€™m simply pleased to get some exposure and have an artifact of free cultureâ€“the CC licenseâ€“appear right there on the cover of an old media phone book.

<p>Carpenter's experience highlights many of the things we love to see - licences increasing content visibility, the ability for a creator to reach a separate agreement outside their original CC license, and <a href="http://www.movingtofreedom.org/images/2008/09/rapid-city-yellow-book--sylvan-sunset--cc-by-30.jpg">proper and thorough attribution</a> (even if we have to agree with Carpenter that a graphic designer might "balk at this kind of verbiage [...] with the picture being such a minor part of the page"). Kudos to Carpenter and the countless others who use CC for everyday reasons and, every so often, experience surprising results.</p>
