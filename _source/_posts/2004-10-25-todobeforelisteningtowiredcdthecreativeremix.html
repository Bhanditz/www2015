<p>If you missed the <a href="http://radio.creativecommons.org/">Creative Remix radio show</a> this Sunday in San Francisco, you can still <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio/">catch it online</a>.<br />
Wow your friends with insight gleaned from Ben Walker's look at the<br />
artistic remix through the ages -- from ancient Greek poetry to modern<br />
historial fiction to aesthetic Nintendo hacks.</p>
<p>Such insight might come in particularly handy these days, when<br />
sampling and creative recombination are hot topics, thanks to the<br />
release of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">certain CD this week by a certain familiar mag</a>. In fact, consider this a homework assignment: in order to best enjoy the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">WIRED CD</a>, you should <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio/">listen</a> to this show first.</p>
<p>Here's a review of the show by a listener on <a href="http://prx.org/">Public Radio Exchange</a>:</p></p>
<blockquote><p>This is one of those perfect public radio programs<br />
that succeeds on different levels. First, of course, is the important<br />
concept of keeping creativity and art out of the hands of the lawyers.<br />
But while listening, I also started thinking about how the idea of the<br />
"remix" could be applied to just about anything, including one of my<br />
favorite topics (cooking) and one of my least favorite (politics). To<br />
me, this is one of the hallmarks of a great "concept" show - you can<br />
envision it extended it beyond the boundries it's placed on itself (58<br />
minutes). --John Dankosky </p></blockquote>
