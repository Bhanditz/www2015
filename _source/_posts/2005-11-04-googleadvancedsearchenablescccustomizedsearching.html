<p>San Francisco, USA â€” November 4, 2005</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides a flexible copyright licenses for authors and artists, today announced that Google now enables filtering for Creative Commons-licensed content</p>
<p>Following the example of <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/cc">Yahoo!â€™s CC-search</a> that was released in March 2004 and then incorporated into Yahoo!â€™s Advanced Search page, Google has incorporated a new element into its <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">Advanced Search page</a> that allows users to filter their search by â€œUsage Rights.â€ By choosing to search for content that â€œallows some form of reuseâ€ or â€œcan be freely modified, adapted or built upon,â€ search results with be limited to content that is made available under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>Creative Commons CEO & Chairman, Lawrence Lessig said â€œCreative Commons is thrilled by Googleâ€™s decision to join Yahoo! in enabling the spread of CC-licensed content.  Now two major search engines recognize Creative Commons licenses; this confirms that CC is an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet.</p>
<p>Creative Commons own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/find/">search page</a> now gives site visitors the ability to search using either Google or Yahoo!.</p>
