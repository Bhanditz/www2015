<p>A few weeks ago, CC received an interesting email from filmmaker <a href="https://twitter.com/Annie_Berman">Annie Berman</a>. She told us about a CC-licensed documentary she's been working on called <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/annieberman/the-faithful-the-king-the-pope-the-princess"><i>The Faithful</i></a>. The film explores issues of fandom and ritual, with Elvis Presley, Pope John Paul II, and and Princess Diana as its focal points.</p>
<p>As Annie was working the film, she contacted by Robert Sillerman&#160;&#8212; owner of the name, image, and likeness of Elvis Presley&#160;&#8212; for an interview. And suddenly, <i>The Faithful</i> was not only about the followers of iconic figures, but also about who owns their images.</p>

<p>The film features an interview with CC founder Lawrence Lessig. In the clip below, Larry answers a pressing question: can Annie Berman make this film?</p>

<p><i><strong>Updated November 20:</strong> We incorrectly reported that Robert Sillerman initially contacted Annie Berman while she was working on the documentary. She contacted him.</i></p>
