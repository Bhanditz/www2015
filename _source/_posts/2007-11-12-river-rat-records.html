<p><a href="http://www.riverratrecords.com/">River Rat Records</a>, an independent record company based in North London, has adopted CC-licenses for all their releases based on the assumption that sharing of music should be allowed without fear of legal ramifications (<a href="http://www.riverratrecords.com/about">as long as it stays non-commercial</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Music has never been a purely personal experience (more often it's a shared one), but the nightmare of having to digitally and uniquely identify ourselves for permission to hear something is fast becoming reality.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to sharing what we enjoy? How confused children must be these days - encouraged to share sweets but incarcerated for sharing music.</p>
<p>Historically, rats have always been good at sharing things. Let's face it, more people have heard of the plague than the Pogues. The casual sharing of music is a brilliantly infectious method of free marketing, and we think it's important to spread that message, for the benefit of artists and music lovers alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>River Rat joins an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7571">increasingly</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7654">large</a> pool of record labels that, in some part, base their business plans around CC-licensing. River Rat just celebrated their first release, <a href="http://www.riverratrecords.com/artists/Ruth+Theodore">Ruth Theodre's Worm Food</a>, which you can pick up at their website.</p>
