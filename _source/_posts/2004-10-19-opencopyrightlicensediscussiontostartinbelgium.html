<p>Creative Commons begins work with the<br />
University of Namurâ€™s cyberlaw research center to offer Belgian<br />
versions of its â€œsome rights reservedâ€ copyright licenses</p>
<p>San Francisco, <span class="caps">USA</span> and Brussels, <span class="caps">BELGIUM  </span>Oct.<br />
19, 2004 Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of<br />
creative work free to share and build upon, announced today its plans<br />
to create localized Belgian versions of its free tools.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses, which are available at no charge from the groupâ€™s website (<a href="http://creativecommons.org">http://creativecommons.org</a>),<br />
allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or<br />
transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€<br />
in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thus eliminating<br />
undue legal friction.</p>
<p>Belgium joins thirteen other nations<br />
in the draft and comment phase of adapting the Creative Commons<br />
licenses. Nine nations today offer localized Creative Commons licenses,<br />
and several dozen more are in the preliminary draft phase.</p>
<p>In<br />
cooperation with the Centre for Research on Computer Law (CRID) at the<br />
University of Namur, Creative Commons has worked to adapt the copyright<br />
licenses for use under Belgian law. <span class="caps">CRID</span><br />
intellectual property experts SÃ©verine Dusollier, Philippe Laurent, and<br />
LoÃ¯c Bodson have produced the French language draft, and MÃ©lanie Carly,<br />
a researcher at the University of Leuvenâ€™s Center for Intellectual<br />
Rights (CIR), will publish a Dutch language draft later this month.</p>
<p>â€œWe<br />
are honored to work with these two great institutions,â€œ said Lawrence<br />
Lessig, Professor at Stanford Law School and Chairman of Creative<br />
Commons.</p>
<p>The Belgian drafts are available for review and public comment at &lt;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/be">http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/be</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>â€œWe are thrilled to be join the International Commons and to contribute in bringing it to Belgium,â€ said Dusollier.</p>
