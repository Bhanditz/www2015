<p>Marco Hinic, 'visualist engineer' and founder of VJ application <a href="http://www.arkaos.net/">ArKaos</a>, recentlly decided to experiment with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/group/ninghosts">Nine Inch Nails Ghosts Film Festival</a>, eventually creating <a href="http://ghostss.com/">Ghostss</a>, a C++ powered online generative art project that creates infinite visual remixes by pooling over 1GB worth of video and select tracks from <em><a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/">Ghosts: I-IV</a></em>. The result might be one of the coolest video remixes to date and in lieu of the contest rules, Hinic's videos are released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">BY-NC-SA license</a> meaning you can share and remix them as well. From <a href="http://createdigitalmotion.com/2008/09/08/ghostss-nin-video-remix-as-an-online-creative-commons-powered-app/">Create Digital Music</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few days ago I released the web site ghostss.com; itâ€™s my entry to the NIN Ghosts Film Festival.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s an online video remixing application. It builds playlists describing a mix of videos with effects and renders them as an .flv Flash Video file. All the content is on the web site â€” around 1 gig of video loops and a few mp3â€™s from NIN music.</p>
<p>In accordance to NIN music, all Videos are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike license.</p>
<p>The web site is a mix of c++, php and javascript for the client side. Basically the client builds a playlist with video references and effects, the playlist is translated into an xml request that is sent to the web site. The video </p></blockquote>
