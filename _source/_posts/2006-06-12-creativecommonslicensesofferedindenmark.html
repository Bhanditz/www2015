<p>San Francisco, USA, Berlin, GERMANY â€“ June 12, 2006</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible copyright licenses for authors and artists, unveiled a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Denmark on Saturday.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">groupâ€™s website</a>.The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of creative materials without legal friction.<br />
Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Project Leads Thomas Riis and Jan Trzaskowski to adapt the standardized<br />
licenses to Danish law. Creative Commons Denmark are supported by the Law Department of Copenhagen Business School.</p>
<p>On June 10, the Danish versions of the Creative Commons licenses were launched in Copenhagen at a ceremony held in Politikens Foredragssal. At<br />
the event, hosted by Copenhagen Business School, Professor Lawrence Lessig (Chairman and CEO of Creative Commons) gave the keynote<br />
address. The ceremony was sponsored by Copenhagen Business School, <a href="http://www.bvhd.dk">Bender von Haller Dragsted</a> law firm and <a href="http://www.ibm.dk">IBM Denmark</a>.</p>
<p>Says Dr. Thomas Riis, â€œThe Creative Commons licenses will benefit the cultural life in Denmark. Creators and users of everything from music,<br />
weblogs and homepages to paintings and books will profit from the licenses.â€ Dr. Jan Trzaskowski adds that â€œthe licenses make it much easier<br />
and faster to exchange creative works, which falls perfectly in line with the vibrant cultural life in today's Denmarkâ€.

<p>About Creative Commons</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licences provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various foundations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Omidyar Network Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as members of the public.
