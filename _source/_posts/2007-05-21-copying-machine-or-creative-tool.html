<p><a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1159">Ed Felten distills</a> the impact of computers on cultural production and the ensuing debate to its essence:<br />
<blockquote>[W]hether IT is primarily a copying machine, or a creative tool</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer to most reading this <em>Creative</em> Commons blog will be obvious, but Felten lays it out in great detail in a talk called <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/rip/">Rip, Mix, Burn, Sue: Technology, Politics, and the Fight to Control Digital Media</a>, which he apparently reprised last weekend.
