<p>The Institute for Information Law at the University of Karlsruhe (TH) will lead the license translation and work to expand global access to Germany's culture.</p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, USA, and Berlin, GERMANY</strong> - April 5 - Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative works free for copying and re-use, announced today that it would expand its International Commons (iCommons) project to Germany.</p>
<p>The Institute for Information Law at the University of Karlsruhe (TH), Germany, will lead the effort.</p>
<p>First announced in March 2003, iCommons is Creative Commons' project to disseminate its machine-readable copyright licenses worldwide and make them useful in a variety of legal systems.</p>
<p>As the lead institution, the Institute for Information Law at the University of Karlsruhe (TH) will coordinate a public effort to translate the Creative Commons licenses literally and legally for use in Germany.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to be able to work with the excellent Institute at Karlsruhe," said Lawrence Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford University, where the organization is headquartered. "Germany will play an important role in bringing the International Commons to fruition in Europe."</p>
<p>"We are tremendously excited to be involved in bringing the Creative Commons movement to Germany," explained Professor Dr. Thomas Dreier, the iCommons Germany project lead and an acclaimed authority on German copyright law.</p>
<p>"There is already strong demand within the German community for a legal means for facilitating the distribution of Open Content as an innovative alternative to traditional forms of distribution based on payment of royalties. Creative Commons will be a great platform on which to build these protocols and agreements. Thanks are due to Dr. Till Jaeger, who provided the first draft of the license."</p>
<p>The Institute for Information Law at the University of Karlsruhe (TH) will field comments on an archived email discussion at the Creative Commons website, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#germany">http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#germany</a>.</p>
<p>Germany joins Australia, Brazil, China, Croatia, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom in the iCommons effort.</p>
