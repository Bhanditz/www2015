<p><a href="http://akira.arts.kuleuven.ac.be/andreas/blog/">Andreas Bovens</a> suggested looking at <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=132120&cid=11037190">this comment</a> on a <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/08/2251224">Slashdot story on the future of digital audio</a>.</p>
<p>You may be able to pick up the gist of the <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=132120&cid=11037190">comment thread</a> from the <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=132120&cid=11037293">punchline</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe the problem isn't that the music is fragile, only that your rights are. Maybe the solution isn't worrying so much about "backups," but making sure that you give your money to someone who respects their customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The respectful party above is our favorite non-evil record label, <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a>, but the moral of the story -- make sure your <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/fullrights">rights</a> aren't fragile, especially when your hardware is -- works in favor of any <a href="http://creativecommons.org/find/">CC-licensed content</a>.</p>
