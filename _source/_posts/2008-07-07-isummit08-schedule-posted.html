<p><span style="float:right;margin:10px"><a href="http://icommonssummit.org"><img src="img/isummit08_friend.jpg " width="135" height="135" border="0" /></a></span>The iSummit, an annual conference that originally grew around Creative Commons, but has grown beyond CC to encompass related movements, has <a href="http://icommonssummit.org/summit_blog/2008/07/isummit-programme-schedule-up.html">announced</a> its <a href="https://icommons.pentabarf.org/programme/iSummit08/index.en.html">2008 schedule</a>.</p>
<p>As befitting a conference dedicated to global digital culture and hosted by Sapporo, Japan, the schedule is very diverse, including tracks on open education, open business, local/global collaboration, openness in Japan, and most exciting to me, a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8436">concurrent commons research workshop</a>.</p>
<p>One of the keynotes I'm particularly looking forward to is <a href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/">Rebecca MacKinnon</a> on <a href="https://icommons.pentabarf.org/programme/iSummit08/events/195.en.html">Free Culture and Free Speech: Why strong and vibrant free culture communities are important for freedom of expression</a>, one of <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/2006/conference/conference-sessions/freespeech">my favorite topics</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement also includes this about remote viewing and participation:<br />
<blockquote>And for those who can't make it to the event - we'll be documenting the highlights so that you can participate 'remotely'. We'll have liveblogging, lists of resources on the wiki which you can add to, in-depth articles, a Flickr feed of photos from all attendees, the keynotes will be streamed and will be available on our <a href="http://au.youtube.com/user/isummit08">Youtube channel</a> and Dotsub collection and a daily podcast will be made available. There is so much to do it'll be like you are in Sapporo along with us!</p></blockquote>
