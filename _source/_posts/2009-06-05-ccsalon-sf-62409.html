We hope you can join us at the next <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/San_Francisco_Salon">ccSalon SF</a> when we will explore the digital intersection of art, history, and culture, and how CC can play a defining role in enriching all three. Our presenters for the evening:</p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.magnes.org/narratives.htm">Francesco Spagnolo</a>, Director of Research and Collections at <a href="http://www.magnes.org/">the Magnes Museum</a> in Berkeley. Francesco will explore the sharing and marketing of cultural heritage through the lenses of the Magnes' â€œDigital Narratives,â€ a project that seeks an alignment between a narrative approach to history, a collaborative practice in the interpretation of cultural history, and the uses of technology and online social media.<br />
* <a href="http://outhink.com/about/">Dave Toole</a>, CEO and Founder, <a href="http://www.outhink.com/">Outhink Media</a>, will present on how storytelling bridges the cultural and business arenas, outlining the challenges posed by the new social media and the crucial role played by research in information technology.<br />
* <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/~vanhouse">Nancy Van House</a>, Professor, <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/index.php">UC Berkeley School of Information</a>, will respond to the other presenters by reflecting on the way in which academia is looking at social media and personal/historical digital archiving, exploring the human interactions that populate the online world.</p>
<p>When: Wednesday, June 24, 7-9pm<br />
Location: <a href="http://parisoma.com">PariSoMa</a>, 1436 Howard St. (<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=1436+howard+st+san+francisco&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=de&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=image">map and directions</a>).
