<p>Earlier this week, Facebook announced its launch of community pages, pages based on topics of interest to the community that are not maintained by a single author. Single author pages include band or company pages that intend to promote that band or company. Instead, community pages are based on the concept of "shared knowledge" that underlies Wikipedia. Community pages integrate Wikipedia content which retains the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons license</a>.</p>
<p>For example, check out the community page for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cooking/113970468613229?v=wiki">Cooking</a>. The page has directly imported <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> licensed content from the Wikipedia entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking">Cooking</a>. All links to Wikipedia are retained, including direct links to edit the information. At the bottom of the page, the source of content is explicitly stated with links to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> license and history of the article:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21725" style="border: 1px solid blue;" title="fb wikipedia" src="img/fb-wikipedia.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="87" /></a></p>
<p>For more information on how Wikipedia is integrated into community pages, check out Facebook's FAQ on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?topic=profileconnections">Community pages</a> and an <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2010-April/057598.html">email</a> from Wikimedia Foundation's Head of Business Development, Kul Takanao Wadhwa:<br />
<blockquote>Wikipedia articles on Facebook will further increase the reach of free knowledge on the internet.  Facebook has hundreds of millions of users, and now more than 70% of their traffic is coming from outside of the US. Our hope is that many Facebook users (if they are not already) will also be inclined to join the large community of Wikipedia contributors. Facebook will follow the free licenses (CC-BY-SA) and help us find more ways people can share knowledge. Furthermore, we will be looking at other ways that both parties can cooperate in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-further-reduces-control-over-personal-information">privacy concerns</a> about they way Facebook has connected community pages to user profiles -- these concerns have nothing to do with the reuse of Wikipedia content.</p>
