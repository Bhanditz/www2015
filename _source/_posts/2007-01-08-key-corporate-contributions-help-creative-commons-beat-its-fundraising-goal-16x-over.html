<p>San Francisco, USA â€” January 7, 2007</p>
<p>Creative Commons today announced that generous support from a variety of key technology companies â€” including <a title="Microsoft" href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, <a title="Mozilla" href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, <a title="Digital Garage" href="http://www.garage.co.jp/en/index.html">Digital Garage,</a> <a title="Yahoo!" href="http://creativecommons.org/www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>, <a title="Macrovision" href="http://creativecommons.org/www.macrovision.com">Macrovision</a>, <a title="Red Hat" href="http://creativecommons.org/www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>,<a title="DivX" href="http://creativecommons.org/www.divx.com"> DivX</a>, <a title="Tucows" href="http://creativecommons.org/ww.tucows.com">Tucows</a> and <a title="Second Life" href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> â€” pushed Creative Commonsâ€™ fundraising campaign to an extraordinary success. In combination with the proceeds from the <a title="Wired Benefit Concert" href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6083">Wired Benefit Concert</a>, other significant corporate contributions from <a title="Google" href="http://creativecommons.org/www.google.com">Google</a> and <a title="Sun" href="http://creativecommons.org/www.sun.com">Sun</a> announced earlier in the campaign, and contributions from Ariel Capital Management, <a title="Brave New Films" href="http://www.bravenewfilms.org/">Brave New Films</a>, <a title="Current TV" href="http://www.current.tv/">Current TV</a>, and <a title="Wiki-How" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">Wiki-How</a>, these new contributions combined to push the total amount raised to close to $500,000 â€” more than 1.6x the original target of $300,000.</p>
<p>Notably, the largest corporate contributions have come from Mozilla and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoftâ€™s contribution is the corporationâ€™s second to Creative Commons and follows the release in June 2006 of the <a title="Microsoft Office CC licensing plug in" href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5948">Microsoft Office CC licensing plug in</a>, which allows people to easily apply a Creative Commons license to their Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. Mostly recently, it joined with Google and Yahoo! to release a <a title="joint sitemap protocol" href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6154">joint sitemap protocol</a> under <a title="CC Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">CC Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license</a>.</p>
<p>â€œCreative Commons aims to advance innovative thinking about copyright in our information-based society,â€ said Tom Rubin, Associate General Counsel of Microsoft. â€œBy providing new ideas that leverage the flexibility of copyright, Creative Commons has pioneered solutions that benefit both creators and the public.  Microsoft is pleased to support programs that strive to respect intellectual property rights while benefiting creators, consumers and society at large.â€</p>
<p>Mozilla has been a long time supporter of Creative Commons. A Creative Commons search option in the pull-down search menu within all versions of Mozilla Firefox has enabled more than 80 million people to easily locate intellectual property available under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>â€œCreative Commons has provided a trusted framework for the exchange and flow of information assets online,â€ said Christopher Beard, vice president of marketing and product management at Mozilla. â€œWe're extremely pleased to continue our support of a fellow public benefit organization that has established itself as a leader in shaping the future of the Internet.â€</p>
<p>Yahoo! and Red Hat were also second time contributors, while Digital Garage, Macrovision, Second Life, DivX and Tucows contributed to the San Francisco based non-profit for the first time. Many of these companies have also made important technical contributions to Creative Commons as well. Yahoo, for example, has developed a search portal that filters results on Creative Commons licenses. And since its launch, Second Life and Creative Commons have worked together to assure that the rights to content created in Second Life remain with the author â€“ not the company. Second Life has also become an important forum for debates surrounding Creative Commons and the global digital commons. Most recently it was the platform used for Lawrence Lessig to publicly announce his retirement as Creative Commons Chairman â€” passing a virtual torch to CCâ€™s new chairman, the Japanese venture capitalist, Joi Ito.</p>
<p>â€œOur community of authors, scientists, creators and educators has made Creative Commons the success it has become,â€ CEO Lawrence Lessig commented. â€œBut it is an extraordinary reward to see that success recognized by some of the most important Internet technology companies. We, like they, build infrastructure for the digital age. They make moving bits easier; we make moving the rights associated with those bits easier as well.â€</p>
<p>About Creative Commons<br />
Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licences provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various organizations including the <a title="John D. and Catherine T. Macarthur Foundation" href="http://creativecommons.org/www.macfound.org">John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</a>, <a title="Omidyar" href="http://www.omidyar.net/">Omidyar Network</a>, the <a title="Hewlett Foundation" href="http://www.hewlett.org/Default.htm">Hewlett Foundation</a>, and the <a title="Rockefeller Foundation" href="http://www.rockfound.org/">Rockefeller Foundation</a> as well as members of the public.
