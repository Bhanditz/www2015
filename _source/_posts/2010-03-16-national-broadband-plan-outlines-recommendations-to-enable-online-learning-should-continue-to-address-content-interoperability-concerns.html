<p>Today the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC)Â released its long-awaited <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/plan/">National Broadband Plan</a>. The plan aims to "stimulate economic growth, spur job creation, and boost capabilities in education, healthcare, homeland security and more." The FCC has taken particular interest in the power of broadband to support and promote online learning. We applaud the FCC for working to make this a priority, especially in exploring how broadband can enable access to and participation in the open educational resources movement, empowering teachers, students, and self-learners.Â  In the plan, the FCC offers <a href="http://broadband.gov/plan/11-education/#s11-1">several recommendations</a> in expanding digital educational content. A few of the recommendations are listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 11.1: The U.S Department of Education ... should establish standards to be adopted by the federal government for locating, sharing and licensing digital educational content by March 2011.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>While digital content is available currently, there are significant challenges to finding, buying and integrating it into lessons. Content is not catalogued and indexed in a way that makes it easy for users to search. It is also hard for teachers to find content that is most relevant and suitable for their students. Even if one finds the right content, accessing it in a format that can be used with other digital resources is often difficult or impossible. And if the desired content is for sale, the problem is even harder because online payment and licensing systems often do not permit content to be combined. These three problemsâ€”finding, sharing and license compatibilityâ€”are the major barriers to a more efficient and effective digital educational content marketplace. These barriers apply to organizations that want to assemble diverse digital content into materials for teachers to use, as well as to teachers who want to assemble digital content on their own. Digital content standards will make it possible for teachers, students and other users to locate the content they need, access it under the appropriate licensing terms and conditions, combine it with other content and publish it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommendation 11.2: The federal government should increase the supply of digital educational content available online that is compatible with standards established by the U.S. Department of Education.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>[ ... ] Whenever possible, federal investments in digital education content should be made available under licenses that permit free access and derivative commercial use and should be compatible with the standards defined in recommendation 11.1.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Recommendation 11.4: Congress should consider taking legislative action to encourage copyright holders to grant educational digital rights of use, without prejudicing their other rights.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In part due to a lack of clarity regarding what uses of copyrighted works are permissible, current doctrine may have the effect of limiting beneficial uses of copyrighted material for educational purposes, particularly with respect to digital content and online learning. In addition, it is often difficult to identify rights holders and obtain necessary permissions. As a result, new works and great works alike may be inaccessible to teachers and students ... Increasing voluntary digital content contributions to education from all sectors can help advance online learning and provide new, more relevant information to students at virtually no cost to content providers ... Congress should consider directing the Register of Copyrights to create additional copyright notices to allow copyright owners to authorize certain educational uses while reserving their other rights.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of these recommendations can help to enable the sharing and downstream reuse of Open Educational Resources (OER) via public licenses that grant broad permissions. And as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21054">we wrote</a> last week, the Department of Education--through the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/os/technology/netp.pdf">National Education Technology Plan</a> (PDF)--has already offered suggestions for how open licensing can aid teaching and learning by making content created by the federal government available for use or adaptation.</p>
<p>One recommendation, however, misses the mark - the suggestion that Congress direct the Copyright Office to create a new copyright notice to allow rightsholders to authorize specific education uses of their content while reserving all other rights.Â <span style="font-size: small">While the suggestion for this <a href="http://broadband.gov/plan/11-education/#r11-4">(e) mark</a> is a good first step in recognizing the need for educational content to be shared widely, its utility will be limited and its implementation confusing. To begin with, it's difficult to determine what will qualify as "educational" content and use. Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3633">considered this 7 years ago</a> and has revisited the question since, as an "education license" sounds very appealing.Â The reality is that allowing educational uses, or worse allowing only certain educational uses, adds to the growing problem of non-interoperable content silos whose contents cannot be intermingled without running afoul of copyright. These qualifiers are counter-productive in that they inhibit rather than incentivize use by teachers, learners, and others of the resources stored and isolated in the silos. Â "Education only" uses wouldÂ dampen innovation by publishers and other content creators that otherwise would be enabled under an open license granting broad permissions. </span></p>
<p>Additionally, narrow permissions break the promise of a widely interoperable commons. Public licenses that grant broad permissions for the use and reuse of content provide the most clear path forward in solving the interoperability problem. Creative Commons supplies a standardized framework for such public lienses, and has been adopted by many in the education community. It is important that any future initiative intended to increase sharing of eudcational content--legislated or otherwise--consider interoperability with existing OER as a design requirement.</p>
<p>The FCC has recognized that robust broadband infrastructure is crucial for citizens to participate effectively in the 21st century digital environment. Open licensing is a piece of this critical infrastructure. Creative Commons hopes to continue to work closely with the FCC, the Department of Education, and the OER community in order to implement the infrastructure necessary to support and promote online learning.</p>
