<p><strong>Creative Commons launches Version 4.0 of its license suite</strong><br /><em>Refreshed copyright licenses function globally and cover new rights</em></p>
<p><strong>Mountain View, CA, November 26, 2013:</strong> Creative Commons (CC) announced today that Version 4.0 of its licensing suite is now available for use worldwide.</p>
<p>This announcement comes at the end of a two-year development and consultation process, but in many ways, it began much earlier. Since 2007, CC has been working with legal experts around the world to adapt the 3.0 licenses to local laws in over 35 jurisdictions. In the process, CC and its affiliates learned a lot about how the licenses function internationally. As a result, the 4.0 licenses are designed to function in every jurisdiction around the world, with no need for localized adaptations.</p>
<p>In a blog post celebrating the launch, CC general counsel Diane Peters acknowledged the role that CC's affiliates played in developing the new licenses. â€œThe 4.0 versioning process has been a truly collaborative effort between the brilliant and dedicated network of legal and public licensing experts and the active, vocal open community. The 4.0 licenses, the public license development undertaking, and the Creative Commons organization are stronger because of the steadfast commitment of all participants."</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that enables the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools. Creators and copyright holders can use its licenses to allow the general public to use and republish their content without asking for permission in advance. There are over half a billion Creative Commonsâ€“licensed works, spanning the worlds of arts and culture, science, education, business, government data, and more.</p>
<p>The improvements in Version 4.0 reflect the needs of a diverse and growing user base. The new licenses include provisions related to database rights, personality rights, data mining, and other issues that have become more pertinent as CC's user base has grown. "These improvements may go unnoticed by many CC users, but that doesn't mean they aren't important," Peters said. "We worry about the slight nuances of the law so our users don't have to."</p>
