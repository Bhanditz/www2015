<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14394" title="casestudies-splash" src="img/casestudies-splash.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>The significance of Creative Commons and its licenses is often overlooked, embedded as it is into the fabric of sharing culture on the web. The current <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23583">superhero campaign</a> attempts to bring CC's role to the forefront, by <a href="https://creativecommons.net/superheroes/">highlighting</a> people and organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to this culture. But there are many more excellent stories of people and projects employing our CC licenses for educational, humanitarian, scientific, artistic, and just plain interesting uses. Some of these are currently reflected in our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies</a> on the wiki, but there's a lot of work left to be done in making these more accessible and useful to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Part of that is improving the entry points for people new to CC, so we are highlighting case studies for different areas. We just added one for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Case_Studies">open educational resources (OER) case studies</a>, focusing on the most compelling CC education project or implementation in policy from each country. Examples make the jobs of those advocating for OER at the policy level much easier, and we often notice a surprising lack of knowledge that many of the most compelling examples are to be found around the world. So we started this page to help everyone who is supporting OER advocacy efforts, and we encourage you to go ahead and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">add your own case study</a> and write up its story; the more developed a case study is, the more likely it is to be featured and shared.</p>
<p>Other areas we have highlighted include <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Government_use_of_Creative_Commons">Government use of Creative Commons</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data">CC0 use for data</a>. These case studies are also far from complete, so we encourage you to add to and improve them.</p>
<p>We've added a few more fields to the Case Studies template as well. For instance, have you ever tried to implement CC licensing into a publishing platform? Then you know that it would have been helpful to know how other platforms have done it. Alex <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/11/18/technical-case-studies-now-on-the-wiki/">mentions</a> that we've gone ahead and added a field for technical implementations to Case Studies. See the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Blip.tv">Blip.tv case study</a> as an example. In addition, we've added a field for "Impact"---what is the effect of this project or resource being under a CC license? What has it enabled that otherwise would not exist? Etc.</p>
<p>Like the rest of our content, the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies</a> are under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, so do add, improve, remix, translate, print out and pass around, show them to your mom, or otherwise reuse them!</p>
