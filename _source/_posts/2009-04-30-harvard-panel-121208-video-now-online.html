<p>As many of you may remember, last December CC paired up with Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society to host a panel discussion entitled, "The Commons: Celebrating accomplishments, discerning futures." Panelists included <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/boylesite/">James Boyle</a>,<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300137400?ie=UTF8&tag=centeforthest-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0300137400">The Public Domain</a></em>; <a href="http://www.lessig.org">Lawrence Lessig</a>, <em><a href="http://remix.lessig.org/">Remix</a></em>; <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a>, <em><a href="http://freesouls.cc/">Free Souls</a></em>; and <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=5073">Molly S. Van Houweling</a>, Creative Commons' first Executive Director. <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a>, of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, moderated.</p>
<p><strong>A video of the panel discussion is <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/CC-BerkmanPanel.m4v">now available at Internet Archive</a> for you to watch and download.</strong></p>
<p>We hope you'll enjoy the video, which offers an intimate glimpse into CC's history through the eyes of the people who were there from the beginning. Larry, Molly, Jamie and Joi each recall some wonderful stories and anecdotes from the early days of CC, and offer up new perspectives on where the organization should be headed. It's a great video that speaks to the importance and relevance of CC as an organization  and a leader in the move toward a more participatory culture.</p>
