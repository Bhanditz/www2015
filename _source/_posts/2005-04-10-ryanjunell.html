<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#25">Ryan Junell</a> and I first met at the University of Texas, where we both took a class about the Internet (Ryan designed UT's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970105010402/http://www.utexas.edu/index.html">first web site</a>; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5376">I caught on more slowly</a>) and saw each other at a lot of rock shows. It wasn't until Creative Commons started up and needed a graphic designer that Ryan and I reunited and became friends. Ryan is responsible for, among other things, our tasteful and fetching logo, the amazing animations in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learnmore">Get Creative and Reticulum Rex</a> (and the latter's anagrammed title), our DVD, many of our t-shirt designs and printed materials, and CC's close connections with the Bay Area electronic music scene (where Ryan is a sort of freelance video artist). Along with Matt, it's Ryan we have to thank for Creative Commons' bold visual identity.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out Ryan's handiwork outside of Creative Commons, you <a href="http://texasmonkey.com/new.list.html">ought to</a>. His <a href="http://www.seetheelephant.org/">See the Elephant!</a> video installation toured the country late last year, and his music videos for <a href="http://texasmonkey.com/spoon/">Spoon</a> and <a href="http://texasmonkey.com/naturalhistory/">The Natural History</a> nail the aesthetics of those bands. (Ryan's hilarious and sharp video for <a href="http://texasmonkey.com/softpinktruth/">The Soft Pink Truth</a> was, along with Anime, South Park, Hello Kitty, and Schoolhouse Rock, the inspiration for the look and feel of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learnmore">"Get Creative"</a>.)</p>
<p>Ryan is pursuing more solo projects now, but I hope one day to team up with him again on some sort of media project. It's extremely rare to find someone whose taste jibes so well with your own -- or better put, who is able to read your mind, and then do you one better.</p>
