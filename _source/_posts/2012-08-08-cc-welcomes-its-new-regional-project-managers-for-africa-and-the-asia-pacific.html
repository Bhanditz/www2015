<p>It is my great pleasure to welcome to CC&#8217;s staff our new Regional Project Managers for Africa and the Asia-Pacific&#160;&#8212; Tobias Schonwetter and Alex Gakuru (Africa) and Jane Hornibrook and SooHyun Pae (Asia-Pacific).</p>
<p>The role of the Regional Project Managers is to support and foster CC&#8217;s community in their regions. Creative Commons has volunteer teams operating in over 70 countries, all of whom work to support and promote the adoption of CC in their local jurisdictions, while at the same time providing valuable expertise and input to CC&#8217;s work globally. CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28403">introduced the Regional Project Manager positions</a> last year as part of a broader strategy to enhance the role and profile of this affiliate community.</p>
<p>Tobias, Alex, Jane and SooHyun have all worked with the CC community for many years, and are experienced advocates of open in their regions. The decision to appoint two project managers for each of the regions was influenced by a number of factors, including the strong pool of candidates and the size and cultural diversity of the geographic areas they will be covering. Each manager will work with their colleague to create a regional support team that is able to respond quickly and adeptly to the needs of their community. This follows the extremely successful application of the same model in Latin America, where Carolina Botero and Claudio Ruiz share the role.</p>
<p>Within each of the regions, we have specifically chosen the managers to have complimentary skills, locations, and backgrounds. Tobias is a lawyer and academic based in South Africa while Alex is a communication technologies expert working out of Kenya. Meanwhile, Jane is a Community Manager at the National Library of New Zealand and SooHyun is a translation expert in South Korea. All four of the managers have close ties to their local Creative Commons communities and either currently or formerly hold leading roles on their countries&#8217; teams.</p>
<p>I would like to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31964">thank the outgoing project managers</a> for these regions&#160;&#8212; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/staff#aureliaschultz">Aurelia Schultz</a> (Africa) and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/staff#chiakihayashi">Chiaki Hayashi</a> (Asia-Pacific)&#160;&#8212; who have both dedicated a great deal of time to building their local CC communities over the last year and have achieved wonderful results. Both are moving on because of time commitments, and will continue to work with CC in other roles.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank all who applied for the positions&#160;&#8212; we had an unexpectedly large response and there were many very strong candidates.</p>
<p>Congratulates to Tobias, Alex, Jane, and SooHyun on your appointments, and I look forward to working with you going forward.</p>
