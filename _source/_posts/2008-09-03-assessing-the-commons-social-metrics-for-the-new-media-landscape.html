<p>Hopefully, everyone that supports CC also knows that we're a non-profit organization. As such, we rely on <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">individual, corporate, and foundation support</a> to sustain our operations. This past spring, CC submitted a proposal called <em>Assessing the Commons: Social Metrics for the New Media Landscape</em> to the <a href="http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/rdb/media-hub">Social Science Research Center (SSRC)</a>. This grant would fund CC and <a href="http://commonsresearch.wikidot.com/">Giorgos Cheliotis</a> of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/sg/">CC Singapore</a> and the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> to conduct research on the "global patterns of CC license use, as well as develop metrics showing penetration and impact of open licensing, per jurisdiction and globally." Sadly, it was denied, but they saw great promise in it, along with a number of other projects.</p>
<p>Because they saw so much promise in projects they were unable to fund, they decided to start their <a href="http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/grants/honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</a> page. They are using this hub as a way to pitch these projects to other interested foundations. Check out our <a href="http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/grants/honorable-mentions/copy_of_philly-media-watch-engaged-and-embedded-media-monitoring-for-media-empowerment">project</a>, and feel free to pass it along to anyone you think might be interested. To indirectly support this project by supporting CC's operations, please visit our <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate page</a>. </p>
