<p>Several months ago, Apple released the music software <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a>, allowing anyone with a mac to make some music. Soon after the release, community websites sprang up to allow Garageband users to share music with each other, and build songs together. This is a perfect use for Creative Commons licenses, and earlier <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3997">we noted</a> that the site <a href="http://macband.com/">Macband</a> added our licenses to their site. We were delighted to hear that <a href="http://www.macjams.com/article.php?story=20040417194505674">MacJams has also incorporated Creative Commons licenses</a> into their song uploading process. </p>
<p>So if you're a Garageband user that needs some drum loops or other song parts to share, check out <a href="http://macband.com/">Macband</a> and <a href="http://www.macjams.com/">MacJams</a>.</p>
