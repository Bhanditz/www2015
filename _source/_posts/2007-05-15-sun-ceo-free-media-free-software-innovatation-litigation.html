<p>Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz has a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/what_we_did">fine blog post in which he describes the Sun's decision</a> to pursue an "open" strategy rather than prosecute the "open" world and its results:<br />
<blockquote>In essence, we decided to innovate, not litigate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further down:<br />
<blockquote>All of which is to say - no amount of fear can stop the rise of free media, or free software (they are the same, after all). The community is vastly more innovative and powerful than a single company. And you will never turn back the clock on elementary school students and developing economies and aid agencies and fledgling universities - or the Fortune 500 - that have found value in the wisdom of the open source community. Open standards and open source software are literally changing the face of the planet - creating opportunity wherever the network can reach.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nice to see this nod to open media. What company will be the Sun equivalent in the media space? Creative Commons will be a key part of that company's strategy, as open standards and more recently open source have been key for Sun. The rest of the industry will follow.</p>
