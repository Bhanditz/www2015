<p>Today Creative Commons and the Association of Educational Publishers (AEP) <a href="http://contentincontext.org/index.php/program-sessions/219-special-media-announcement">announce</a> the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative, a project aimed at improving education search and discovery via a common framework for tagging and organizing learning resources on the web. The learning resources framework will be designed to work with <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>, the web metadata framework recently <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html">launched</a> by Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, as well as to work with other metadata technologies and to enable other rich applications.</p>

<p>The great promise of Open Educational Resources (OER) to provide access to high quality learning materials is limited by the discoverability of those resources and the difficulty of targeting them to the needs of specific learners. Creating a common metadata schema will accelerate movement toward personalized learning by publishers, content providers and learners, and help to unleash the tremendous potential of OER and online learning.</p>
<p>From AEP's <a href="http://www.aepweb.org/mediacenter/AEP-CC-Schema_6-7-11.htm">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This is a watershed project for our industry. It benefits both users and content providers because improved discoverability expands the market," said Charlene Gaynor, CEO of AEP. "Being part of the process allows publishers to address issues such as quality and suitability as dimensions of educational content."</p></blockquote>
<p>CC is co-leading the LRMI with the Association of Educational Publishers, which includes publishers such as Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, McGraw-Hill Education, Scholastic, Inc. and Pearson. Open education organizations in addition to CC also support the project, including the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISMKE), Curriki.org, BetterLesson.org, and the Monterey Institute for Technology (MITE).</p>
<p>To learn more about the timeliness and impact of the LRMI, CC's role in the project, and what this means for OER and online education publishers, grantees of the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s $2 billion <a href="http://creativecommons.org/taa-grant-program">TAACCCT</a> program, other CC-using publishers and platforms, and technologists, please see our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LRMI/FAQ">LRMI FAQ</a>.</p>
