<p>We'd like to point out GOOD's latest interview from its "We Like to Share" series by Eric Steuer---"<a href="http://www.good.is/post/frances-pinter-on-the-academic-value-of-sharing/">Frances Pinter on the (Academic) Value of Sharing</a>." Frances elaborates on <a href="http://www.bloomsburyacademic.com/creativecommons.htm">Bloomsbury Academic</a>'s decision to license their academic publications via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a>, academics' need for exposure, and the changing landscape in publishing,</p>
<blockquote><p>"So much of academic output is now available on the web, and when you talk to academics they are not 100 percent happy with how difficult it is becoming to find their works. They are looking for tools; a digital means of selecting, filtering, and ranking the materials they are using and recommending. We are actually in a period of transition where we are still relying on the old, but wanting to experiment with the new. People like myself who spend a lot of time with the open access crowd can kind of forget there are a lot of academics who arenâ€™t so vocal, who are primarily interested in producing their content, getting materials in front of their students, and getting their promotion and their recognition for work that they produce.</p>
<p>In this period of transition there is a lot of investment required in experimenting with new technologies. And with the experimenting of new technologies, we have to make sure the recognition and the openness is absolutely essential and part of it."</p></blockquote>
