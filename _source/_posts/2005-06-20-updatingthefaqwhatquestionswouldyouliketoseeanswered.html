<p>So our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/faq">FAQ</a> is out-of-date (no surprises there) and we'd like to make it up-to-date so that it is relevant and useful to people who use our licenses and tools, and people who use works licensed under one of the Creative Commons licenses. To make sure it is useful & relevant, we'd like feedback from those most concerned and most likely to use the FAQ. We have already had some suggestions over the years of things to include in the FAQ but are interested in knowing if anyone has any additional suggestions of things they'd like to see. Obviously, we won't be able to address every question and always need to be mindful of the fact that we cannot provide legal advice; but for those with suggestions - please send suggestions to <a href="mailto:info@creativecommons.org">our info email address</a>.</p>
