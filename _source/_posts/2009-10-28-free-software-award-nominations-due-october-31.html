<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13568"><img src="img/3381675611_91188b9985_m.jpg" style="float:right; padding:5px" /></a>Creative Commons was deeply honored to receive 2008's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13568">Free Software Foundation Award for Project of Social Benefit</a>, presented "to a project that intentionally and significantly benefits society by applying free software, or the ideas of the free software movement, in a project that intentionally and significantly benefits society in other aspects of life."</p>
<p>The FSF is <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2009FSAwardsCall">currently accepting nominations</a> for the 2009 Award for Project of Social Benefit, as well as the Award for the Advancement of Free Software, presented "to an individual who has made a great contribution to the progress and development of free software, through activities that accord with the spirit of free software."</p>
<p>Free software and in particular the FSF's pioneering use of public copyright licenses to protect the freedom of computer users inspired and made possible the free culture movement and in particular Creative Commons -- and the use of free software girds the freedom of the network and application layers needed for free culture to thrive.</p>
<p>If you already know free software well, please reflect and <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2009FSAwardsCall">make a nomination</a> for one or both awards. We're particularly eager to see what great project wins the social benefit award!</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with free software, some good places to start are <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9112">our post on the movement's 25th anniversary</a>, the <a href="http://fsf.org">FSF home page</a>, and Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Free_Software">Free Software Portal</a>.</p>
