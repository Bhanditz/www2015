<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portishead">Portishead</a>, an experimental-pop group and pioneers of the early 90s electronica movement, announced yesterday that they are now "free agents", having completed their three record deal with <a href="http://www.islandrecords.com/">Island Records</a>. The band is looking at new ways to sell their music and <a href="http://www.thedailyswarm.com/headlines/portishead-free-agents-asks-fans-if-you-lot-have-any-bright-ideas-how-we-should-sell-our-music-future-lets-us-know/">are reaching out to their fans for advice</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>with the world being the way it is there are lots of options openâ€¦...but if you lot have any bright ideas of how we should sell our music in the future lets us know , why not!</p>
<p>i dont think that were into giving out music away for free to be honestâ€¦it [...] takes ages to write and we have to heat our swimming poolsâ€¦..!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>While Portishead mention an aversion to giving away music for free, our thoughts immediately turned to a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccplus">CC+</a> licensing model similar to what <a href="http://www.nin.com/">Nine Inch Nails</a> used in marketing <em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8095">Ghosts I-IV</a></em> and <em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8267">The Slip</a></em> this past year. NIN gave away their music for free under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>, but they also found <a href="http://www.thedailyswarm.com/headlines/no-soundscan-nine-inch-nailss-ghosts-first-week-nets-trent-reznor-16-million/">immediate and substantial financial return</a> as well as seeing their <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11947">long-term sales flourish</a>. </p>
<p>NIN achieved this by selling different versions of the same content; there was the initial free download of the first nine tracks of Ghosts, but <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/main/order_options">fans could also purchase a $5 download of the whole album, a $10 2xCD set, a $75 DVD box set, and finally, a limited edition $300 ultra-deluxe box set signed and numbered by Trent himself</a>, all of it CC licensed. Given <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=portishead+fans">the notoriety of Portishead fans</a>, something tells us that if the band were to offer a $300 unreleased album in an ultra-deluxe box set in conjunction with freely licensed versions of the same music, it would probably sell out just as quick as NIN's 2,500 copies did.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.myspace.com/PORTISHEADALBUM3">let Portishead know</a> that there are indeed ways to make money while giving music away for free - its all <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12695">about connecting with their fans via CC</a>, and giving them an easy way to support the band.</p>
