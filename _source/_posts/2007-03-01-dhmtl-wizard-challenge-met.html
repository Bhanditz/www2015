<p>A few days ago we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7252">announced a new version implemented in Flash</a> of the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org">ccLabs</a> experimental Freedoms License Generator and issued a challenge to DHTML developers to equal the performance and visual improvements of the Flash version, using DHTML.</p>
<p>That didn't take long. Sylvain Zimmer of <a href="http://jamendo.com">Jamendo</a> (see our most recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7256">post</a> about Jamendo's CC music portal) <a href="http://blog.jamendo.com/index.php/2007/03/01/the-freedoms-chooser-dhtml-challenge-from-creative-commons-done/">whipped up a DHTML version of the puzzle pieces interface</a> used in the Freedoms License Generator that is just as slick and fast as our Flash version.</p>
<p>The implementation is not complete -- it doesn't provide copy & paste license HTML -- but it proves the point that Flash is unnecessary for this application. The next iteration of the ccLabs project will integrate Sylvain's code with HTML and metadata generation.</p>
<p>Thanks Sylvain!</p>
