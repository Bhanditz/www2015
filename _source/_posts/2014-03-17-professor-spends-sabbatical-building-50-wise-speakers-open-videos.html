<p>I recently interviewed Dr. Phil Venditti, professor of communication studies at Clover Park Technical College in Washington State (USA). Phil teaches public speaking and other oral and written communication courses. In 2010 Phil learned about the <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org/" title="Open Course Library">Open Course Library</a> project and became an enthusiastic adherent. Phil developed two courses in the Open Course Library, wrote a textbook which he licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, and has since saved his students roughly $60,000 by using open educational resources (OER).</p>
<p>The Open Course Library was Philâ€™s first exposure to OER, but it wasn't his last. He testified to the State Legislature in favor of a bill which would have mandated that all educational materials created by state postsecondary education employees be openly licensed. As President of <a href="http://factc.org/wp/">FACTC</a> -- the Washington Faculty Association of Community and Technical Colleges, Phil has promoted adoption of OER by college faculty members throughout his state. FACTC passed a resolution in 2012 endorsing the ideal of OER on economic, educational, and moral grounds.</p>
<p>Phil recently went on sabbatical and decided to interview 50 prominent speakers to gather tips on effective public speaking for his students -- and for the world because all of Phil's work and videos are openly licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 license</a>. Nearly 30 hours of his videos can be browsed at Phil's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PLs9z28IVBuVgVNSsFwyvDu_0nRtzS4Tmp">YouTube channel</a>. Speakers included in the project are 29-time Emmy winner and "Almost Live" alum Bill Stainton, Tacoma News Tribune Executive Editor Karen Peterson, former NFL quarterback Jon Kitna, Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland, and wildlife artist and conservationist Becci Crowe. To complete the project, 40 of Philâ€™s public speaking students and a team of editors from Clover Parkâ€™s Media Design and Production program spent more than 700 hours reviewing and editing the interviews. When it is launched online in May of this year, the project will offer a database of free, CC BY-licensed materials at <a href="http://cptc.edu/fifty-wise">cptc.edu/fifty-wise</a> on subjects ranging from how to conquer stage fright to how to organize a presentation. </p>
<p>On March 20, the "50 Wise Speakers" project will be presented in a red-carpet gala at Clover Park Technical College.</p>
<p>Phil says OER has changed the way he thinks about teaching and learning. </p>
<blockquote><p>"I believe that the essence of education should be sharing. Every day I ask myself, â€˜How can I help connect more people to more information that might change their lives?'"</p></blockquote>
<p>Following Phil's lead, what will you share today?</p>
