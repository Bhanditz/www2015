<p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/handbook">handbook</a> for Drupal, one of the most popular web content management systems (<a href="http://spreadfirefox.com/">Spread Firefox</a> is a recent high-profile example) has <a href="http://drupal.org/node/14073">adopted Creative Commons licensing so as to</a></p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>make clear that Drupal community members can use the documentation in the Drupal handbook in other contexts, such as revising and developing site specific help docs.</li>
<li>allow the integration of already existing Drupal documentation being developed outside of drupal.org by Bryght, CivicSpace, and others.</li>
<li>eliminate potential legal conflicts over rights of use.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good example of a community taking an existing work with a large number of contributors and obtaining the agreement necessary to take advantage of a standard Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.fourstones.net/">Victor Stone</a> for the pointer.</p>
