<p>Nearly two years ago, I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11021">blogged</a> about <a href="http://www.prathambooks.org/">Pratham Books</a>, a nonprofit children's book publisher in India. "It was set up to fill a gap in the market for good quality, reasonably priced childrenâ€™s books in a variety of Indian languages. [Its] mission is to make books affordable for every child in India." At the time, Pratham Books had released six children's books under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/in/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> license, available on their <a href="http://www.scribd.com/prathambooks">Scribd</a> page. Since then,  they have changed the licenses on those books to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution Only (CC BY)</a> and have expanded their offerings to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/document_collections/2383076">books in the public domain</a>. They have also been <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/">blogging</a> extensively and encouraging remix of their CC licensed illustrations on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/prathambooks/">Flickr</a>. </p>
<p>Last month, the CC licenses enabled <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/2010/02/radio-mirchi-and-pratham-books-join.html">audio versions </a>of Pratham children's books for India's <a href="http://www.nabindia.org/index.htm">National Association of the Blind</a>. Three audio versions were recorded by <a href="http://www.radiomirchi.com/">Radio Mirchi</a>, two in English and one in Urdu, with more in the works. </p>
<p>I asked Guatam John of Pratham Books why they moved towards more open licensing (from the books' original <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/in/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> license), and what else he saw for the future of Pratham's CC licensed books.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Pratham Books has taken the position that all our content will either be under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> license because, to us, these are the only two truly open licenses that fit our needs. Radio Mirchi gave us the content with no terms attached but since it was done pro bono, we felt that putting it out under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> license was the best available choice for both the community, Radio Mirchi and us. Also, the SA component serves to limit commercial use unless it is re-shared, as the license, and our philosophy, mandates.</p>
<p>We continue to release content under open licenses, for example: <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/2010/03/retell-remix-rejoice-with-chuskit-world.html">http://blog.prathambooks.org/2010/03/retell-remix-rejoice-with-chuskit-world.html</a>. And we will continue to do so over time. We have been working with the <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a> project to build a platform for the re-use, remix and distribution of our content too. Our basic goal is a net increase in the available content for children to read from and we think we can catalyse this two ways: Seeding the domain with our content and building a platform to make it easy to re-use and re-purpose content."</p></blockquote>
