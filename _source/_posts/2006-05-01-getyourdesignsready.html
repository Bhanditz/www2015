<p>Inspired by the SXSW Big Bag Competition, <a href="http://icommons.org/">iCommons</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> announce a <a href="http://icommons.org/contest/">contest</a> to design this year's iCommons <a href="http://icommons.org/programme/">Summit</a> bag. With the theme of this year's event: 'Towards a Global Digital Information Commons' and workshops on open creativity, knowledge, science and innovation, we're looking for designs that are creative, visually arresting and informative. The winner will receive a scholarship to attend the June iCommons Summit, so get your friends and communities involved and they could be attending this amazing event in Rio de Janeiro. The deadline for submissions is 9:00 p.m. South African Standard Time, May 15, 2006.</p>
