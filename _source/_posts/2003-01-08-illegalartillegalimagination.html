<p>An interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/07/arts/design/07SAMP.html">piece</a> in the <em><a href="http://nytimes.com">New York Times</a></em> today discusses "Illegal Art: Freedom of Expression in the Corporate Age," an <a href="http://illegal-art.org">exhibition</a> dedicated to works built in part from other copyrighted works -- without permission.</p>
<p>By sign-of-the-times coincidence, I participated in a panel yesterday entitled "The Illegal Imagination," at the Future of Music Coalition's superb <a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/events/summit03/index.cfm">summit</a> in Washington D.C.  Co-panelists Gigi Sohn (<a href="http://publicknowledge.org">Public Knowledge</a>), <a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~sv24/">Siva Vaidhyathan</a> (NYU), musician <a href="http://www.baybie.clara.net/alfonso.htm">Alfonzo Blackwell</a>, and moderator Ira Glass (<a href="http://thislife.org">This American Life</a>) and I discussed precisely the same issues.  Aided by spirited audience participation (one of the many great hallmarks of the FMC gathering), we discussed hip-hop and sampling, the ever-growing world of "<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/01/bootlegs/print.html">mash-up</a>" media, and copyright's influence on creativity, generally.</p>
<p>"Though copyright law can make for arcane discussion," writes the <em>Times</em>' Chris Nelson, "popular culture has brimmed with the subject of late."</p>
<p>And brim it will.  As readers of this blog already know, few can afford to consider copyright "arcane" for much longer.  Whether you're an artist, a fan, a coder, or a casual web-surfer, knowing the ins and outs of copyright -- for better or worse -- is already part of  getting by in the wired world.  Copyright's not just for lawyers anymore.</p>
