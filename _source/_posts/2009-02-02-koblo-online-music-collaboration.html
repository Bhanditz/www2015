<p><img src="img/logo.png" alt="logo" width="164" height="33" align="right" /><a href="http://koblo.com/">Koblo</a> is a new online music collaboration site that utilizes CC licensing on tracks and song stems to promote community remixing and reuse. Uniquely, Koblo exists beyond the web in the form of <a href="http://koblo.com/studio">Koblo Studio</a>, a free and <a href="http://github.com/koblo">opensource</a> software <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a> that has the ability to upload projects to Koblo's community site with all the tracks prepped and ready for remixing. It is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZVbgh4f5ME&amp;feature=channel_page">during this upload process</a> that a CC license can be chosen for the project.</p>
<p>By offering a platform that exists not only as open source software but also allows for CC licensing of material, Koblo has set an exemplary model for their community to follow as it grows in regards to the sharing of content. Related is the <a href="http://koblo.com/shop">Koblo Shop</a>, an online store that will allow community members to sell their remix packs, plugins, loops, and beats in the coming months - the store is already live with preliminary content, including a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> licensed remix pack from Sweedish pop band <a href="http://koblo.com/remix_kits/15">Ace of Base</a>.</p>
<p>Koblo joins an <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">ever</a> <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">growing</a> <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/">list</a> <a href="http://www.mixmatchmusic.com/">of</a> <a href="http://www.tunerooms.com/">great</a> online music platforms that are enabling unintended and unique collaboration through the use of new technologies and the permissive licensing allowed by CC licenses.</p>
