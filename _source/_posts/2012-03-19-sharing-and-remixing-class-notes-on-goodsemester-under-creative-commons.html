<p><a href="https://www.goodsemester.com/">GoodSemester</a>, a new learning platform geared toward academic productivity, has just announced Creative Commons note sharing, copying and remixing. GoodSemester allows learners to find, copy and modify CC-licensed notes throughout its learning service, then integrate these notes directly into their classes. The default license for all new notes created on GoodSemester is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>.</p>
<p>While GoodSemester has made CC BY-SA the default, users can still opt out of sharing their notes. To encourage open sharing, GoodSemester has made sure there are noticeable benefits to keeping notes under the CC license. Restricted notes cannot be copied, shared or remixed. Learners who do share their notes have the opportunity to join a vibrant community of active learners and creators, and to contribute to a growing commons of open educational resources.</p>

<p>In addition, GoodSemester is releasing its own materials under the same <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> license, as noted in the footer of their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>All text and images by GoodSemester are released under an open license. We love open things. To show our support for the open learning movement, all text and images on GoodSemester created by GoodSemester are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">just another</a> great example of a company integrating CC licenses into its platform to increase the functionality of its tools and the value to its community.</p>
