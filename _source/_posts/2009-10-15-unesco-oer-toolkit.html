<p>Last October, I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9818">mentioned</a> that the UNESCO OER Community was developing an <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit">OER Toolkit</a> "aimed at individual academics and decision-makers in higher education institutions interested in becoming active participants in the OER world, as publishers and users of OER." Today, the <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit">draft version (1.1)</a> has been released with an announcement by Philipp Schmidt of the University of the Western Cape, South Africa:</p>
<blockquote><p>"15 October 2009 --- Today the UNESCO OER Toolkit (with support from the UNESCO Communications and Information Sector) was released as a resource for academics and institutions -- with a special focus on developing countries -- who are interested in participating in open education projects.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW -- Most of the Toolkit is designed for academics who are interested in finding and using OER in the courses they teach, or who wish to publish OER that they have developed. Some sections are aimed at institutional decision-makers and academics that [are] interested in setting up a more formal OER project. These projects may start with just a few interested academics but, as they grow, institutional policies, funding and legal constraints become more relevant. Individuals who are not aiming to set up a institutional project may nonetheless be interested to read the whole document. Likewise, institutional planners, IT staff or librarians who are interested in setting up an OER project would benefit from understanding the academic's perspective."</p></blockquote>
