<p align="left">Congratulations to <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT's OpenCourseWare</a> (OCW) initiative, which <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/ocw-tt1128.html">has recently passed</a> the 1,800-course mark. First announced in 2001, MIT OCW has grown from a 50-course pilot to a site that includes virtually the entire MIT undergraduate and graduate curriculum.</p>
<p align="left">Like many OCW projects, MIT uses the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/" title="BY-NC-SA">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike</a> license, giving educators, students and self learners from around the world the ability to copy, remix and share the materials, as long as they do so for non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p align="left">MIT has been a visionary leader for the growing OCW movement. Creative Commons will continue to work hard to support clear, flexible licensing options for various Open Educational Resource (OER) projects. If you have your own open content success story, alert us! We encourage other organizations to add their projects to our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Content_Directories" title="Content Directories">Content Directories</a>. This useful resource helps spread the word about a wealth of great open content ventures.</p>
<p align="left">Watch for the video of  MIT's celebratory event (which featured New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman and a diverse panel of key educators and scholars) to appear soon over at <a href="http://mitworld.mit.edu/" title="MITWorld">MITWorld</a>.</p>
