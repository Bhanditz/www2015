<p>Next Wednesday, Oct. 3rd, <a href="http://www.illuminatedcorridor.com/">Illuminated Corridor</a> is assembling a<a href="http://www.illuminatedcorridor.com/20071003.html"> collision of public art, live music and moving images</a> inspired by the <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~alysons/library.html">Prelinger Library </a>and <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/prelinger">Archives</a>' collections (which we have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4233">discussed</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3681">extensively</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4116">before</a>). Everything will take place in the street and parking lot outside the Library, and on the walls of the building, at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Folsom+St+%26+8th+St,+San+Francisco,+San+Francisco,+California+94103,+United+States&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=0,37.774990,-122.410050&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=42.224734,85.078125&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">8th and Folsom</a> in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>The evening will feature many performative projectionists and musicians, including (but not limited to) Craig Baldwin, Cinepimps (Alfonso Alvarez and Keith Arnold), Steve Dye, AntÃ³nio Jorge GonÃ§alves, Killer Banshee, Charles Kremenak, and Gino Robair, who'll conduct his new score to RP's movie Panorama Ephemera. Neighborhood Public Radio will be broadcasting the audio live, so bring your FM radios!</p>
