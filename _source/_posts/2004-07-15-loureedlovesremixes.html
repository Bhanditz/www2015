Lou Reed is another artist that should check out <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/sampling?lang=en">the Recombo license</a>. Here's a great quote from him about his most recent recordings being remixed <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bb/daily/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000577588">in this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I've been getting all these great mixes sent to me out of the U.K. for years and years," he told Attitude magazine, "and I just started saying to the record company, 'Look, I really, really love what they are doing.' I think that my record company was a little taken aback but, genuinely, if I could make that type of music then I would. If I could master the equipment then I would love to.</p></blockquote>
