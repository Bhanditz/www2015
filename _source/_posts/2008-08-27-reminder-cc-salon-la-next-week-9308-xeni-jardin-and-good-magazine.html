<p>A friendly reminder that we are hosting the latest <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Los_Angeles_Salon">CC Salon LA</a> <strong>next week</strong> (9/3/08) at the <a href="http://www.foundla.com/">FOUND Gallery</a> in Silverlake (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1903+Hyperion+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90027,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">Google map</a>) between 7:30PM-9:30PM. Joining us will be <a href="http://xeni.net/">Xeni Jardin</a>, Tech Culture Journalist and co-editor at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>, and <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/user/casey">Casey Caplowe</a>, Creative Director of <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/">GOOD Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Both will discuss how CC, and 'openness' in general, has been employed in <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">their</a> <a href="http://tv.boingboing.net/">respective</a> <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/">undertakings</a>, touching on the the successes they have had as well as obstacles they have had to overcome, specifically in regards to traditional and non-traditional journalism. Both will be available for Q&amp;A after their presentations. </p>

As always, there will be free (as in beer) drinks for the entire night.</p>
