Currently, many of these talented local teams are adapting Version 3.0, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249">released February 2007</a>, to the laws and languages of more than 70 jurisdictions around the globe. Joining the jurisdictions that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/?jurisdiction=au">offer licenses at 3.0</a> is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/au/">Creative Commons Australia</a>, whose versioning process revealed important insights into the licenses and suggestions for future versions.</p>
<p>The Australian licenses already have their first significant adopter, the Australian Parliament. The Parliament's central web portal <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/">http://www.aph.gov.au</a> houses the most important documents of the Australian Federal  Government  including all bills,  committee reports and, most importantly, the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/index.htm">Hansard</a> transcript of   Parliamentary Sittings, and the portal will be published under a <a href="../licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/au">Creative   Commons BY-NC-ND Version 3.0 Australian license.</a></p>
<p>Thanks so much to the CC Australia team, headed by Professor Brian  Fitzgerald and Tom Cochrane and coordinated by Jessica Coates and Elliott Bledsoe at <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">Queensland University of Technology</a>, for their diligence and input. Congratulations!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/version3">CC Australia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Australian v3.0 licences...have been developed over the last few years via a public consultation process. We thank all of those who provided feedback on the licences, particularly our colleagues at CC Aoteoroa New Zealand and within the Australian government and non-profit sectors.</p>
<p>Our main aims during the Australian v3.0 drafting process were to  ensure that the new licences:</p>
<ul>
<li>complied with Australian legal requirements and conventions;</li>
<li>aligned with the rights and restrictions of the <a href="../weblog/entry/7249">Unported</a> (ie  non-country specific) licences provided by <a href="../">Creative Commons</a>; and</li>
<li>were clear and easy for creators and users alike to read and  understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these aims, we made the following changes to the licences:</p>
<ul>
<li>adapting the Unported formatting and language to bring them more in  line with Australian law and drafting conventions â€“ mainly by using  localised definitions and introducing lists and headings;</li>
<li>simplifying some of the language, where this would not affect the  legal interpretation of the licence â€“ many of these simplifications were  adopted from the recent version put together by our friends in <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/">New Zealand</a>;</li>
<li>a few minor additions to clarify the operation of the licences in  the Australian context, in response to feedback from our consultation  process â€“ these included clarifying how the licences operate with  respect to sublicensing and adding language to ensure that the licences  comply with the requirements of Australian consumer protection law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are happy to release these licences, which we believe provide clear, reasonable and legally sound options for creators and users alike and represent a new best practice standard for the CC licences in Australia. If you would like any more information about the licences please feel free to contact us at info@creativecommons.org.au. For more information on the versioning process contact the Creative Commons head office.</p></blockquote>
