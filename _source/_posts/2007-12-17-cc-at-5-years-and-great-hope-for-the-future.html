<p>For a rundown of the overwhelming number of big announcements made at CC's 5th birthday party in San Francisco, <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2007/12/on_what_exactly_happened_satur.html">see Lawrence Lessig's blog</a>. The party itself was a huge success, with over 600 people attending. Watch this space for more detail on the announced projects as they develop.</p>
<p>In Berlin, headquarters of CC International, a small party became a smashing success with 300 people and some great announcements from CC Germany. See a <a href="http://netzpolitik.org/2007/public-project-lead-von-creative-commons-deutschland/">writeup on the Netzpolitik blog</a>.</p>
<p>There were other <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2007#Parties">CC birthday parties around the globe</a>, but from the photos the most impressive of all may have been put on by CC Korea, called <a href="http://www.creativecommons.or.kr/blog/article/35">CC Hope Day</a>.</p>
