<p>A 44 page guide to <a href="http://wirelessafrica.meraka.org.za/wiki/index.php/DIY_Mesh_Guide">Building a Rural Wireless Mesh Network</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reliable, affordable and easy access to telecommunication services for all has been identified as key to social and economic development in Africa. Self-provisioning and community ownership of low cost, distributed infrastructure is becoming a viable alternative to increase the penetration of telecommunication services in rural Africa. The recent emergence of wireless mesh network technology (based on IEEE 802.11 a/b/g standards) can help to improve the delivery of telecommunication services in these regions.</p>
<p>The guide tries to simplfy the planning and building of a mesh network, using a step-by-step approach to setting up a infrastructure mesh node, or an access point using a Linksys WRT54gl and the Freifunk firmware or DD WRT firmware depending on the node type.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first version of the guide was published earlier this month. I mention both because the guide is licensed under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> and because it would be wonderful if the network layer turned out to be something that could also be peer produced, e.g., see a portion of Lawrence Lessig's <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/events/keynotes/lwsf06-lessig.html">2006 LinuxWorld keynote</a> or portions of Yochai Benkler's <em><a href="http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Main_Page">Wealth of Networks</a></em>, but that aspiration is largely untested. And there's nothing like practical experience.</p>
