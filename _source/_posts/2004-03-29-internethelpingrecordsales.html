<p>Ran across a couple interesting bits related to musicians having their songs online and record sales. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/arts/chi-0403280175mar28,1,7931083,print.story?coll=chi-leisurearts-hed">a roundtable interview with the Chicago Tribune</a> (registration required to view), Creative Commons chairman Lawrence Lessig and the online manager of the band <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/">Wilco</a> talk about the internet and music. The gist of is that putting Wilco's music online helped them sell more records and greatly increase attendance at their live shows. </p>
<p>Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/29/empirical_data_on_fi.html">points</a> at a recent <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a> <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf">study</a> (PDF) that shows popular searches on a P2P network didn't correlate with lower sales.</p>
