The <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&ands=obama+creative+commons&phrase=&ors=&nots=&tag=&lang=all&from=&to=&ref=&near=&within=15&units=mi&since=2009-04-29&until=&rpp=15">microblogs have been</a><a href="http://identi.ca/search/notice?q=whitehouse+flickr&search=Search"> a-buzz this morning</a> about news of the launch of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse">the official White House Flickr stream</a> featuring photos from Obama's first 100 days in office. While the photos are licensed under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a> license, one could make the very strong argument that they're actually in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">public domain</a> and can be used without attribution (though one would have to be careful and respect the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_rights">personality rights</a> of the private citizens featured in some of the photos). The photos are likely in the public domain because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government">they are works created by the federal government</a> and not entitled to copyright protection. As you might recall, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright">Whitehouse.gov's copyright notice</a> indicates as much. </p>
<p>Why would the White House then choose Attribution for their Flickr stream? Simple, unlike communities like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PD">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a>, Flickr doesn't allow their photographers to choose Public Domain as an option to release their work to the world. So the Obama team must have picked the next best option: Attribution only.</p>
