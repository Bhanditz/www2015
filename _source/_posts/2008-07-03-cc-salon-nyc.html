<p>One of my favorite parts of my job as Creative Commons' <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#98">Culture Program Associate</a> in New York is that I get to organize our Salons here. With that in mind, it gives me great pleasure to announce the next CC Salon NYC.</p>
<p>The Open Planning Project's has graciously allowed us to use their wonderful loft space in the West Village. July's salon will feature presentations from Search Wikia, Livable Streets Network, and a special performance from comedian Max Silvestri (of Gabe + Max's Internet Thing).</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
