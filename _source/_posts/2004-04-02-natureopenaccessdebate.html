<p><em>Nature</em> is hosting a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/accessdebate/">debate on open access science publishing</a>.  At the center of the debate are <a href="http://plos.org">Public Library of Science</a> and <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com">BioMed Central</a>, two open access journal publishers using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>.  The PLoS <a href="http://www.plos.org/downloads/HCEvidencefromPLoS.pdf">evidence paper</a> presents a good summary of what is wrong with the current scholarly publishing model, why open access is important, and an open access business model.</p>
<p>Even as the much needed debate on open access journals heats up, it is just one part of a bigger picture where science, creativity, law, and society collide.  Perhaps with this in mind, note the recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4073">post</a> on this weblog concerning the launch of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/science/proposal">Science Commons exloratory phase</a>.</p>
