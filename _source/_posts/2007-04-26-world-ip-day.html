<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Day">World Intellectual Property Day</a> is observed annually on April 26. "Encouraging Creativity" is the theme for 2007.</p>
<p>For this day we've produced a flyer addressing how Creative Commons encourages creativity. You can <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/images/8/8d/World-IP-Day-flyer.pdf">download the PDF</a> or read the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/World_Intellectual_Property_Day">text on our wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the closing paragaph:<br />
<blockquote>In sum, the Creative Commons toolset encourages and enables participation in creativity by everyone, not only those with access to copyright lawyers. This is as it should be in modern democracies, where the tools for expression and creativity are available to everyone as everyday consumer goods.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the spirit of <b>World</b> IP Day, please <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7408">support our campaign</a> to fund this summer's worldwide gathering of Creative Commons International volunteer legal affiliates.</p>
