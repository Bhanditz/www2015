<blockquote>A museum exhibit called <a href="http://www.illegal-art.org/">"Illegal Art"</a> might sound like a history of naughty pictures. Turns out that the exhibit (through July 25 at <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org/museumstore/artists_overview.html">SF MOMA Artist's Gallery</a>) is more innocuous than most primetime TV: A Mickey Mouse gasmask. Pez candy dispensers honoring fallen hip-hop stars. A litigious Little Mermaid. Not kids' stuff, exactly&mdash;but <i>illegal</i>?</p></blockquote>
<p>Creative Commons' Derek Slater has a nice <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/features/illegalart">review</a> of the Illegal Art exhibit, which ends its stay at the SF MOMA later this month, plus some insight into surrounding issues.</p>
