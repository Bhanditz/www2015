<p>In May we noted the first <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> user to be <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5433">discovered and signed to a record label</a> via their participation in ccMixter. Now we have the first record label started by people who first met on the site. Victor Stone explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cezary Ostrowski from Poland and Marco Raaphorst from Holland met online at ccMixter and decided to go into business together. They started an online label called <a href="http://disfish.com">DiSfish</a> where 5% of all sale proceeds to goes to CC, 5% goes to charity and the rest is split between the label and the artist. All music on the label is licensed under CC.</p>
<p>Victor Stone (that's me) from Berkeley and Robert Doiel from southern California met online at ccMixter and collaborated (without ever<br />
meeting) on an album of Doeil's compositions called 'Fourstones plays Weird Polymer' and decided to release it exclusively on DiSfish</p>
<p>The entire album is <a href="http://www.disfish.com/index.php?action=show_artist&artist=68">available for listening, purchasing or licensing</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Victor, Robert, Cezary, and Marco!</p></p>
