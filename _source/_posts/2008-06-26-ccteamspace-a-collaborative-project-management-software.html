<blockquote>The CC staff has been developing and using their internal project management tool for too long, now has come the time for a release!</p></blockquote>
<p>To sum up, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcTeamspace">CcTeamspace</a> is nothing more than a clever combination of different open source tools with a solid data structure. It's mainly powered by <a id="okoq1" class="external text" title="http://semantic-mediawiki.org" rel="nofollow" href="http://semantic-mediawiki.org/">SemanticÂ MediaWiki</a>, an extension which adds semantic abilities to the well known <a id="m6pa" title="MediaWiki" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> software (the engine behind Wikipedia).</p>
<p>I recently developed an extension to add e-mail notifications and reminders to the system. I really think this tool can be useful for many organizations, that's why I handled its public release.</p>
<p>CcTeamspace is free software, you can freely download and install it. It has been developed for internal needs, you're welcomed to add and share your own features.</p>
