<h3>Update 12/16</h3>
<p>The hearings are still going on; please keep calling, emailing, and otherwise <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/fight-blacklist-toolkit-anti-sopa-activists">spreading the word</a>!</p>
<hr style="border-color: #cccccc;" />
<p>Tomorrow the House Judiciary Committee will debate and potentially vote on SOPA, the Internet Blacklist bill that would break the Internet. </p>

<p>Our friends at the Electronic Frontier Foundation have compiled a <strong><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/fight-blacklist-toolkit-anti-sopa-activists">list of 12 actions you can take now to stop SOPA</a>.</strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/fight-blacklist-toolkit-anti-sopa-activists">Do them.</a></h3>
<p><br \/>Soon you'll find a huge banner at the top of every page on the CC site protesting SOPA. The Wikimedia community is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Request_for_Comment:_SOPA_and_a_strike">considering</a> a blackout to bring massive attention to the danger posed by SOPA. Many others are taking action. What are <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/fight-blacklist-toolkit-anti-sopa-activists">you</a> doing?</p>
<p>For background on the bill, why it would be especially bad for the commons, and links for news, check out our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30375">previous post calling for action against SOPA</a> and a <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/12/13/how-sopa-will-hurt-the-free-web-and-wikipedia/">detailed post from Wikimedia's General Counsel</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that CC is crucial to keeping the Internet non-broken in the long term. The more free culture is, the less culture has an allergy to and deathwish for the Internet. <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/">We need your help too.</a> Thanks!</p>
