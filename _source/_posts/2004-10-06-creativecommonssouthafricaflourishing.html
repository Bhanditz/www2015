<p>Creative Commons South Africa has an <a href="http://za.creativecommons.org/resources<br />
">amazing new animation</a> that describes the practical aspects of using our copyright licenses better than any piece of media we've had until now, and with unusual charm. We'll host the animation from this site soon, but until we do, it's available for viewing at the <a href="http://za.creativecommons.org/resources<br />
">South African</a> site, which is worth bookmarking, generally. It's got a <a href="http://za.creativecommons.org/">blog</a> and right now <a href="http://za.creativecommons.org/blog/?p=40">features an interview</a> with <a href="http://wiredmag.com">WIRED magazine</a>'s Thomas Goetz, about the forthcoming CD. Hats off to Heather Ford and the rest of the South African crew.</p>
