<p>This week, the Grammy Awards nominations were <a href="http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx">announced</a> - and, for the first time, a Creative Commons-licensed track and album are on the list. Nine Inch Nails' "34 Ghosts IV" is nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, while the album that track appears on, <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/"><em>Ghosts I-IV</em></a>, is up for Best Boxed Or Special Limited Edition Package.</p>
<p>This year, NIN released both <em>Ghosts I-IV</em> and a second album, <a href="http://theslip.nin.com/"><em>The Slip</em></a>, under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">BY-NC-SA</a> license. Both albums were downloaded for free and shared legally millions of times by fans under the terms of this license. At the same time, NIN found great financial success in selling cool, well-crafted, limited edition physical editions of both sets. Back in March, <em>Wired</em> <a href="http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/03/nine-inch-nai-2.html">said</a> the band made $1.6 million on <em>Ghosts I-IV</em> in its first week of release alone.</p>
<p>Additionally, Radiohead's song "House of Cards" is up for several Grammys, including Best Short Form Music Video. The video's animation data was <a href="http://code.google.com/p/radiohead/">released</a> under a CC BY-NC-SA license earlier this year (see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8476">previous post</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations to Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead for the nominations. Also, congratulations to all of the other artists whose work was nominated for Grammys this year, including Brian Eno, Diplo, Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo (AKA Gnarls Barkley), My Morning Jacket, Gilberto Gil, Peter Gabriel, Thievery Corporation, and Cornelius - all of whom have used Creative Commons licenses and/or have supported CC over the years.</p>
