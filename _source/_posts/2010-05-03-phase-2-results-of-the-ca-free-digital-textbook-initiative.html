<p>Last Friday, Governor Schwarzenegger <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/15050/">announced</a> the results from Phase 2 of the California Free Digital Textbook Initiative. A total of 17 textbooks, including updated versions from Phase 1, were submitted, and 15 have so far been reviewed against California's academic content standards. Of those fifteen, ten carry a CC license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>), two carry a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License#Compatibility_with_Creative_Commons_licensing_terms">GNU FDL</a> license, and one is in the public domain. All but two of the CC licensed textbooks met 100% of California's state standards. Major contributors included a number of individuals, in addition to the <a href="http://ck12.org/">CK-12 Foundation</a> and <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a>, two OER organizations that have a default CC license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, respectively) on their educational resources. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/15050/">press release</a>, "Students and teachers have the flexibility to use these resources in a number of ways. They are downloadable and can be projected on a screen or viewed on a computer or hand-held device. They can also be printed chapter by chapter and bound for use in the classroom and be taken home by students."</p>
<p>This is true for the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> licensed textbooks, as these licenses allow not only reuse and reproduction, but adaptation, which allows one to edit, improve, remix, or translate the resource. </p>
