<p>I'm heading to Portland, Oregon for <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media's</a> <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">Open Source Convention</a> (OSCON) tomorrow.  I'll be presenting an updated and expanded version of my PyCon talk on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8752">Building Extensible Desktop Applications with Zope 3</a>.  The more I work with it, the more I realize that a better title would be <em>Loosely Coupled, Component Based Development with Zope 3</em>.  So if you're attending OSCON and curious about writing applications as a set of much smaller pieces using Python, stop by.  Slides, example code and additional resources are available in the wiki on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OSCON2006">talk page</a>.  See you there!</p>
