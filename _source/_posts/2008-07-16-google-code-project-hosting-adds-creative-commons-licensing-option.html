<p>I'm super proud to announce that <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code's Project Hosting</a> now supports, in complimentary addition to software licenses for code, content licensing. Two options available by default are a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC Attribution</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license</a>. We've been working on this together for a year or so behind the scenes, so its fabulous to see this come out now. Also, this is especially cool coming right after the <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2008/07/14/radiohead-house.html">release of the brilliant</a> <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/">Radiohead</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/creative/radiohead/">"House of Cards" video on Google Code</a> which features <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8476">Creative Commons licensed animation data available now through Google Code Project Hosting</a>.</p>
<p>And, just to be clear, Google Code Project Hosting is supporting Creative Commons licensing for non-source code assets. This functionality compliments the still supported same software licenses. If one wants to override the default options for setting the content license, this may manually changed by the admins of a project.</p>
<p><a href="http://unto.net/">DeWitt Clinton</a>, who led this effort at <a href="http://code.google.com">Google</a> said more at the Google Code blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>
While this may seem like a minor change, it reflects the continued evolution of our mission to support best practices in open source software development.  As the open web increasingly relies on protocols and formats that reach beyond source code, we encourage authors to apply an explicit copyright license to the data, documentation, and related media that complements their work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its nice to see that Google continues to pioneer by supporting the open web. We at CC are hopeful that more and more companies will adopt Creative Commons license support to empower the free and open web that is well beyond just source code. We have <a href="/projects/licensechooser.js">free</a> <a href="/projects/liblicense">tools</a> which make it easy to to add CC license support, lots of <a href="/projects/casestudies">Case Studies</a> to help you decide why to add CC licensing, <a href="/projects/documentation">information documents</a> to explain how you might add CC licensing support and <a href="/contact">people on the ground</a> to help you through any stage of the process and help promote your project's addition of CC licensing through our various <a href="/contact">communication channels</a> like this blog :)</p>
<p><strong>A big cheer to our friends at Google who led this effort</strong>. Please go host all or part of your project on <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">Google Code Project Hosting</a>, test the feature out and let all know how it works.</p>
