<p>A surprise visitor, one Al Gore, dropped in on our landlord and friend Mitch Kapor today, and we commoners took the opportunity to tell the former Vice President about Creative Commons and Science Commons. When Mark Resch presented Mr. Gore with a new Science Commons t-shirt and explained the concept, Gore said that it reminded him of something called the <a href="http://plos.org">Public Library of Science</a>. When we told him that PLoS is, indeed, under a Creative Commons license, he said, "Well, now, good for you."</p>
<p>Nice guy, that Al Gore, and impressively in-the-know.</p>
