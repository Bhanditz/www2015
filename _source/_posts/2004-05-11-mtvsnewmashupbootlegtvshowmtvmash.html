<p>
MTV Europe is currently doing a mash-up show called <a href="http://www.mtvmash.com/">MTV Mash</a>. Mash-up culture has been mainstream in Europe for the past few years, and I hope the show is limited to Europe only because of that, and not because it would be difficult to obtain rights to mash in the States. Links to the songs made on the show can be <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/05/10/mtvs_new_mashup_boot.html">found at BoingBoing</a>, where we first heard about this.</p>
