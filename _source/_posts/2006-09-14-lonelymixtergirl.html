<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonelygirl15" rel="tag">lonelygirl15</a> videos have been featuring music from <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>.  Grant Robertson <a href="http://grantrobertson.com/2006/09/13/where-to-find-the-music-from-lonelygirl-15-youtube-videos/">sorts it out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever wondered where to find all that great music used in the Lonelygirl 15 videos? Having spent months looking for songs featured in TV commercials, I totally feel your pain.</p>
<p>(Metricâ€™s beautiful â€œGrow up and Blow Awayâ€, which was featured for 15 seconds in a Polaroid commercial a few years ago, nearly killed me)</p>
<p>So, if your Jonesing for that sweet music fix you came to the right place.</p>
