<p>January 1st is Public Domain Day, as <a href="http://www.copyrightwatch.ca/?p=49">noted by copyrightwatch.ca</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to 2008, and letâ€™s welcome into the Public Domain thousands, indeed millions, of creative works from the collective cultural past of our little planet and its many countries. Yes, itâ€™s January 1st, Public Domain Day in most countries of the world, where copyright runs from the death of the author of a work until the end of the 50th, 70th, or some other year thereafter.</p></blockquote>
