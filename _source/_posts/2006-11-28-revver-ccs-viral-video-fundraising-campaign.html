<p>Weâ€™ve launched a new fundraising model and are raising money through online video sharing. Weâ€™ve uploaded several short videos to <a href="http://revver.com/">Revver</a>, a video-sharing platform that uses Creative Commons licenses to help creators make money from their work. So, watch our videos (including our latest clip â€” <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/videos#wwt">"Wanna Work Together?"</a>), check out the ads at the end, and help Creative Commons get paid!</p>
