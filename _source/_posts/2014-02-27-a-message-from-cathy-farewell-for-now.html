<p>Dear CC Community,</p>
<p>I love this CC photo of the open road. It is inspiring, and speaks to me of the journey, the path one travels. You can't quite see around the bend, but you suspect the road will take you to another intriguing place, and so you are urged on and continue to learn and explore.</p>
<p>And so it is with me. Tomorrow I will sign off from this section of the path. My journey with CC has had different segments, contexts, and textures. What I have found so rewarding during this leg as CEO is working closely with our deeply talented and dedicated staff, regional coordinators, affiliates, partners, and supporters.</p>
<p>Together, we have made tremendous progress to create a global footprint of sharing, legally. We continue to extend our reach into critical communities - learning, science, data, and culture - and educate the world about the power of open. And while we have not yet reached our collective mission, we have advanced, and will continue to do so. Here at CC, we have worked hard over the past months to ensure the CEO transition is smooth. <a href="/weblog/entry/41605">The board has the search well underway</a> and <a href="/board#paulbrest">Paul Brest</a>, CC board chair, has stepped up as interim CEO. My profound thanks to Paul, both personally and on behalf of the broader community, for his unyielding leadership and support.</p>
<p>My open journey began more than a decade ago with an arc that brought me from Hewlett to Carnegie to CC, and has most often felt like a sprint. So during the next few months, I will pause and relish more time with family and at the coast, and the opportunity to trek along remote mountain paths. After my hiatus, after what I am sure will feel like the blink of an eye, you will find me re-engaged to advance the newly emerging architecture for learning, an ecosystem no longer constrained by time, space, and pace.</p>
<p>Looking back on the open road, I am grateful for the camaraderie of fellow travelers energized by the challenge. And looking ahead, I await our next productive collaboration.</p>
<p>Until then I wish you all the very best,<br />Cathy</p>
