<p>We've posted a brief <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Board_Reports/2008-06">report</a> that summarizes the details of Creative Commons' most recent board meeting, which took place on June 19 and 20, 2008. Going forward, we intend to do this for all of our board meetings (and we'll try to get the reports online more quickly in the future!).</p>
