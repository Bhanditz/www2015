<p>Today the <a href="http://www.openhighschool.org/">Open High School of Utah</a> (OHSU) announced the release of ten semesters of openly licensed curriculum materials. The OER are licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution</a> (CC BY) license. The resources are available via OHSU's <a href="http://www.ocw.openhighschool.org/">OpenCourseWare portal</a>. From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Technology rules atÂ OpenÂ HighÂ where their approach to learning embraces the idea that teaching shouldn't be as static as the textbooks on which it's based. Shattering traditional methods, theÂ OpenÂ HighÂ SchoolÂ of Utah curriculum is built fromÂ openÂ educational resources. These resources are the foundation for their content and are aligned with Utah state standards to ensure the highest quality educational experience. The teachers enhance with screencasts, interactive components, and engaging activities to createÂ highÂ quality curricula for their students.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Open High School of Utah is a public online charter high school.Â As DeLaina Tonks, OHSU's Director, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22975">told us in an interview</a> a few weeks ago, "The objective behind creating open content is to create free and simple access to knowledge and information through collaboration and innovation. The OHSU mission dovetails nicely with that of open education because we are among the first, if not the first, secondary school to create our own OER curriculum and share it worldwide."</p>
<p>Congratulations to The Open High School of Utah for being a leader--both in vision and practice--for the Open Education community.</p>
