Our project's international roll-out continues. Two more countries have now come up with their local licenses.</p>
<p>
First, on Saturday, Sep 4, Lawrence Lessig will be speaking in Taipei, where the <a href="http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw">Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica</a>, as the Taiwan project lead, has completed the porting process and is now presenting the licenses to the island's public. Special thanks to Yih-Suan from the Acadamia Sinica, who put most of the finishing touches on the Taiwanese licenses.</p>
<p>
Second, in the Alps, the transposed Austrian licenses will be celebrated and discussed during the week-long <a href="http://www.aec.at">Ars Electronica Festival</a> in Linz, Austria. Lawrence Lessig will participate in a symposium on 'Commons & Communities - Social Life in the Digital Age' at the Brucknerhaus on Sep 6, 10.30am, while Roland will say a few words on the launch event proper at the Brucknerhaus on Sep 7, 3pm. Much work on the Austrian licenses was done by Julia Kueng and Georg Pleger, our local project leads.</p>
<p>
As an important signal for all open source projects and free software initiatives, Creative Commons also won the Golden Nica in the 2004 Prix Ars Electronica's Net Vision category. Christiane will receive the prize on behalf of CC on Friday, Sep 3, at the Prix Art gala event in Linz.</p>
<p>
Anybody interested in attending one of the talks above and thus getting in touch with us is welcome.</p></p></p>
