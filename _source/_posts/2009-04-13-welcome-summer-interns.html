<p>We have finally concluded our rigorous search for summer interns. This year, we'll be welcoming five students to work at the San Francisco office. Thanks to everyone who submitted an application. It was great to see such an incredible number of responses!</p>
<p>Please let me introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://leesean.net/">Lee-Sean Huang</a> will be the International Outreach intern for ccLearn. He is a first-year masters student at the Interactive Telecommunication Program (ITP) at NYU Tisch School of the Arts.
</li>
<li>Joe Merante will work under our General Counsel as a Legal intern. He is a second year law student at New York Law School.
</li>
<li>Michelle Hugard will work with the ccLearn counsel as another Legal intern. She is a second year law student from UC Davis School of Law.
</li>
<li><a href="http://madebyparker.com/">Parker Phinney</a> will be the Technology intern. He is a first year student of computer science at Dartmouth College.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tomasashe.com/">Tomas Ashe</a> will be the very fist Graphic Design & Media Development intern. He will be completing his final year at the Cork Institute of Technology in Ireland.
</li>
<li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13795">Aurelia Schultz, our first Google Policy Fellow</a>, will also be joining us this summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also see our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8872">goodbye post</a> featuring last year's interns. If you're interested an internship next year (<b>2010</b>), keep in mind that we'll post a call for applications around February. Get your resumes into shape starting now! The strongest applicants have played leadership roles in <a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a> chapters or been active contributors to other free culture and free and open source software projects -- regarding the latter, we even have <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer">a few of our own to get involved with</a>.</p>
