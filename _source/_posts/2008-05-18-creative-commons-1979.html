<p>Denver Gingerich <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-community/2008-May/003769.html">writes about a 1979 feature article about copyright</a> that appeared in the University of Waterlooâ€™s <em>Gazette</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I found it especially neat that the Gazette includes this note: "Editorial material may be reprinted freely; credit would be appreciated."  This seems similar in intent to the Creative Commons Attribution license (possibly with a No Derivative Works clause). From what I've seen of recent newspapers, a license that allows free<br />
redistribution is seldom used anymore.  I wonder why that is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Denver <a href="http://ossguy.com/?p=32">put the whole feature on his website</a>.</p>
