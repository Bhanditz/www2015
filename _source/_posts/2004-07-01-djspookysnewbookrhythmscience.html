<p><a href="http://www.djspooky.com/">DJ Spooky</a> (aka Paul Miller), early supporter of Creative Commons, has recently released his new book, <a href="http://www.rhythmscience.com/">Rhythm Science</a>.  The subject matter is very Creative Commons in philosphy as he explores ways to think about rebuilding culture.  Here's an excerpt from the site:</p>
<p>
"Taking the Dj's mix as template, he describes how the artist, navigating the innumerable ways to arrange the mix of cultural ideas and objects that bombard us, uses technology and art to create something new and expressive and endlessly variable."</p>
<p>
He's also in the process of releasing <a href="http://www.djspooky.com/art.html">Rebirth of a Nation</a>, a remix of D.W. Griffith's 1915 <a href="http://www.filmsite.org/birt.html">Birth of a Nation</a>.  Since the original film is from 1915, it is now in the public domain. More to come on this soon.</p>
