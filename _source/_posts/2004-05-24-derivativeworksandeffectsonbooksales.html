<p>Suw Charman has <a href="http://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/24/75489.html">a great article on The Free Culture AudioBook Project</a> that touches on all the reasons why an author would use a Creative Commons license, and what can come out of such an exercise. The issues around business models in publishing are also covered.</p>
