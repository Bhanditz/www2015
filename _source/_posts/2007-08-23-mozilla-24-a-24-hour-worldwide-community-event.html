<p>Our good friends over at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> are hosting the <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/">Mozilla 24</a> conference on Sept. 14th - 16th, spanning many continents and time zones.  This event will feature presentations by industry leaders on the trends and technologies that will help shape the future of the Web. The cool thing about this conference (besides the content &amp; <a href="http://www.mozilla24.com/en-US/about/">speakers</a>, of course) is that it will take place at locations in Japan, Europe, and at Stanford University (you can register <a href="www.mozilla24.com/en-US">here</a> for the U.S. conference which is completely free). Don't be disappointed if you're unable to attend in person - it will also be happening online via the broadband video WIDE network so that anyone can participate from anywhere. Oh, the beauty of the internet.</p>
