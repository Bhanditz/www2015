<p>Creative Commons would like to take this opportunity to remember the great contribution made to its community by Atty. Jimmy Soriano.</p>
<p>Jimmy first joined the CC community in 2005 when he launched our CC Philippines team. Over the past 7 years, he has been a constant presence at CC events, a major contributor to discussion and debates, and a particularly influential figure in our Asia-Pacific community. For several years, he served as head of the CC Asia and the Pacific Community, launching its first newsletter and hosting its conference in Manila in 2009. Jimmy&#8217;s friendliness, patience and wisdom made him a natural leader in our community, taking the role of mentor and advisor to many new affiliates in his region.</p>
<p>In his role both in CC and as Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.lawphil.net/">e-Law Center</a> of the <a href="http://www.arellanolaw.edu/">Arellano University School of Law</a>, Jimmy was a particularly strong advocate for open education and the need to make knowledge and learning accessible to all. He practiced his own values through his teaching, advocacy and academic work, in which he sought to make the law accessible and understandable to all members of society.</p>
<p>Jimmy passed away on Monday, after a year of lingering illness. He will be greatly missed by all in the CC community.</p>
<p><o>Below are a few memories of Jimmy and messages for his family shared by CC&#8217;s community. You can find more messages <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Jimmy_Soriano">here</a>.</p>
