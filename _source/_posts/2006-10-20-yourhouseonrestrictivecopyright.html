<p>Matt Haughey, who <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2006/10/18/creative-commons-fund-drive-2006/">was Creative Commons' first designer</a>, writes about an <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2006/10/20/misadventures-in-copyright/">annoying encounter with copyright paranoia in a distinctly non-digital field</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year I moved into a new house with a big backyard, but the yard faces directly south, so it bakes in the summertime. I decided to find a local architect to help build a small shade patio off the back, and in the process I learned a lot about how far-reaching copyright law hits everyday people.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to keeping homeowners from plans, in the future rulers and other measuring devices should be DRM-<s>en</s>disabled so that plans may not be reverse engineered, otherwise architects will have no incentive to design new houses! Right?</p>
