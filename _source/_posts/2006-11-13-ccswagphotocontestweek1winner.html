<p>Today's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">winner</a> of this week's CC Swag Photo Contest is <i>Naufragio</i>. We applaud his use of the CC and showing his CC pride. Good job <i>Naufragio</i>!</p>
<p>To all our CC supporters who are considering entering the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">CC Swag Photo Contest</a>, do not be discouraged! There are 5 weeks remaining, that means 5 more weeks of winners to be announced! This photo in no way shapes the context of this contest - we are open to all entries as long as the work supports both your vision of CC and CC's mission by using CC Swag. Whether that swag is purchased in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/store">store</a> (which goes directly to our annual campaign), acquired over time by attending CC events, or belongs to a friend is entirely up to you and will not be considered by the judges.</p>
<p>Creative Commons wants to thank all the participants and to encourage everyone to continue shooting, uploading</p>
