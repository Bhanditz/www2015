<p>The <a href="http://www.copyleftfestival.net/">Copyleft Festival 2008</a> kicked off yesterday in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arezzo">Arezzo, Italy</a> (located in Tuscany) with a great looking lineup of speakers and events. From <a href="http://www.copyleftfestival.net/">CF2K8</a><span style="LOL"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Four days full of debates, meetings, music and shows that speak about Copyleft and Creative Commons licences. From the 11th to the 15th of September, the city of Arezzo in Tuscany will be the capital of free circulation of ideas. The festival will take place in Arrezo's two central squares and will host a bevy of guests including the collective of writers <a href="www.kaizenlab.it/">Kai Zen</a>, the French mathematician <a href="http://paigrain.debatpublic.net/">Philippe Aigrain</a> and new media expert Gabriele Lunati (who will explore copyleft and CC applied to music).</p>
<p>On Sunday the 14th, a 'barcamp' about new media and citizen journalism will take place from 11AM to 5PM. Space to debate, with round tables dedicated to open source/public administration, bank loans, music and CC-using professionals will also be available. Every day features book presentations, projections, shows.
