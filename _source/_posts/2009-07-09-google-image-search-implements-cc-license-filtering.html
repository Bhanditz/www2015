<p>Today,Â <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/find-creative-commons-images-with-image.html">officially launched the ability to filter search results using Creative Commons licenses</a> inside theirÂ <a href="http://images.google.com/" target="_blank">Image Search</a> tool. It is now easy to restrict your Image Search results to find images which have been tagged with our licenses, so that you can find content from across the web that you can share, use, and even modify. Searches are also capable of returning content under other licenses, such as the GNU Free Documentation License, or images that are in the public domain.</p>
<p>To filter by CC search, go to Google's <a href="http://images.google.com/advanced_image_search" target="_blank">advanced Image Search</a> page and select the options youâ€™d like in the â€œUsage rightsâ€ section. Your results will be restricted to images marked with CC licenses or other compatibly licensed photos.</p>
<p>Remember, Google can only provide search results thatÂ its algorithms find tagged with the license you specify; it is your obligation to verify the license of the image youâ€™re using and make sure youâ€™re conforming to its guidelines.</p>
<p>This is a huge step forward for the future of image search on the web, so congratulations to the Google team on another great CC implementation!</p>
