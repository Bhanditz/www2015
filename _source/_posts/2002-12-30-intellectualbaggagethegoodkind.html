<p>For some particularly excellent commentary about Creative Commons licenses, check out Denise M. Howell's <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/">Bag and Baggage</a>, one of the snappiest law-and-tech blogs out there.  Denise <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2002_12_15_bgbg_archive.html#90079883">chronicles</a> her own experience applying one of our licenses to her blog and <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2002_12_15_bgbg_archive.html#90077201">addresses readers' questions</a> about the licenses, among other things.  </p>
<p>As <a href="http://lessig.org">our chairman</a> has pointed out in his own blog, it's just this sort of community participation and reporting that the Creative Commons model will rely on.  So thanks to Bag and Baggage and the many others out there revving up the discussion.</p>
