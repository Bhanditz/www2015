<p>A little over a month ago, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7541">WIRED Magazine held a concert to benefit Creative Commons</a> in Los Angeles with <a href="http://www.spoontheband.com/">Spoon</a>, the Austin, TX based rock-quartet, headlining. The show was absolutely phenomenal - opener <a href="http://www.myspace.com/koolkeith">Kool Keith</a> rocked the party hard and Spoon failed to disappoint with a killer set that spanned their varied discography. Oh, and need we forget <a href="http://beatbots.org/">Keepon</a>, the lovable dancing robot, was in attendance?</p>
<p>It was really an amazing way to kick off both WIRED NextFest and to foster sustainability for CC in the longterm. A big thanks to WIRED Magazine for making it happen - there constant support is a huge help to CC and the CC community. Don't forget to check out some amazing pictures by Dave Bullock (<a href="http://eecue.com/">eecue</a>) on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eecue/">flickr</a> as well:</p>
