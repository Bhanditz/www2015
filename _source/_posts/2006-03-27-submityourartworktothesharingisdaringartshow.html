<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://www.freeculturenyu.org/">Free Culture @ NYU</a>'s <a href="http://www.freeculturenyu.org/ccartshow/">Creative Commons Art Show</a>, the good people of <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/freeculture/">Harvard Free Culture</a> are organizing <a href="http://www.sharingisdaring.org/">Sharing Is Daring</a>, an exhibition of Creative Commons-licensed artwork to be held in Cambridge the week of April 10. Wanna be a part? Lucky you -- there's an open call for submissions until this Saturday, April 1. (Thanks to Elizabeth Stark for the info.)</p>
