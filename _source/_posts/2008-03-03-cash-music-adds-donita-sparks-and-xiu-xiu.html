<p><a href="http://cashmusic.org/">CASH Music</a> (who we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7896">blogged about glowingly here</a>) has recentlly added new media from both seminal rocker <a href="http://donitasparks.cashmusic.org/">Donita Sparks</a> and experimental indie act <a href="http://xiuxiu.cashmusic.org/">Xiu Xiu</a>. </p>
<p>Donita Spark's page has <a href="http://donitasparks.cashmusic.org/downloads.php">CC licensed free downloads</a> as well as the ability for people to own a <a href="http://donitasparks.cashmusic.org/sparksync.php">share of a percentage of the sync license royalty check</a> for Spark's single "<em>Heâ€™s Got the Honey</em>". Xiu Xiu's page is similarly experimental, giving users the ability to <a href="http://xiuxiu.cashmusic.org/singonthissong.php">upload their own tracks for Xiu Xiu to sing on</a> as well as a collection of <a href="http://xiuxiu.cashmusic.org/haiku.php">fan submitted haikus</a> and a <a href="http://xiuxiu.cashmusic.org/polaroids.php"> gallery of Polaroids</a>.</p>
