<p>Friends and Commoners,</p>
<p>It is with incredible sadness that I write to tell you that yesterday, Aaron Swartz took his life. Aaron was one of the early architects of Creative Commons. As a teenager, he helped design the code layer to our licenses, and helped build the movement that has carried us so far. Before Creative Commons, he had coauthored RSS. After Creative Commons, he co-founded Reddit, liberated tons of government data, helped build a free public library at <a href="http://archive.org/">Archive.org</a>, and has done incredibly important work to reform and make good our political system. (<a href="http://demandprogress.org/">DemandProgress.org</a>, his most recent org, was instrumental in blocking the SOPA/PIPA legislation one year ago.)</p>
<p>More than all that, Aaron was a dear friend to all of us, and an inspiration to me and many of you. Our prayers are with his parents and those who knew his love. But everything we build will forever know the product of his genius.</p>
