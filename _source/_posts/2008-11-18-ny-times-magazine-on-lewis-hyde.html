<p>This past weekend, <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> published an excellent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/magazine/16hyde-t.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">feature</a> on author and scholar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hyde">Lewis Hyde</a>, best known for his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Creativity-Artist-Modern-Vintage/dp/0307279502">The Gift</a></em>, a landmark assessment of the gift economy and the value of doing creative work in a commodity-driven culture. I read <em>The Gift</em> a few years ago, and pieces from it often pop into my head when I talk to artists who use Creative Commons licenses in their approach to distributing their work. The <em>Times</em> article is a great primer on Hyde and <em>The Gift</em> is highly recommended for anyone interested in beautifully-written and well-argued philosophy about the benefits of sharing.</p>
