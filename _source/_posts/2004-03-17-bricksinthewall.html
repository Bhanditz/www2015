<p>Bricks in the Wall</p>
<p>Theater and drama fans are familiar with the Fourth Wall, the conceptual boundary between<br />
performer and audience. It's an artistic term, but we've now extended the concept in a Creative Commons way. At the <a href="http://sxsw.com">South by<br />
Southwest Film Festival</a> this week, I moderated a panel, "Can Copyright Bring Filmmaker and<br />
Audience Together?", that explored creative ways for filmmakers to (1) maximize distribution<br />
and/or (2) encourage interaction with their works by going Some Rights Reserved. The premise for the talk was the idea that any worthwhile discussion of film today has got to address the copyright bricks in the Wall.</p>
<p>We were lucky to have a fantastic group of panelists. Creative Commons contest winner <a href="http://justincone.com">Justin Cone</a><br />
described the making of "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/movingimagecontest">Building on the Past</a>" and explained how the process of working with public domain<br />
footage opened his eyes to a new range of aesthetic possibilities. (Justin, a newcomer to moving images,<br />
is now pursuing other film projects.) <a href="http://hello.typepad.com/">David Jacobs</a>, chief technologist of youth media activists <a href="http://mediarights.org">MediaRights.org</a>,<br />
explained the group's decision to Creative Commons license their Media That Matters Film Festival.<br />
All-around media head <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/wiggins">Wiley Wiggins</a> put his finger on the single app that we need to make Commons'd film catch<br />
fire: a simple "share" button and license menu in Quicktime and other film editing tools.<br />
Zack Exley, organizing director of <a href="http://moveon.org">Moveon.org</a>, reflected on Moveon's <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/">Bush in 30 Seconds</a> contest<br />
and told of his brushes with copyright trouble in his <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-03-03/screens_feature9.html">former life as a political satirist</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, in a headlong dive through the Fourth Wall, actor-writer-director David Ball announced the release of his full-length feature<br />
<em>Honey</em> -- plus all its component parts, from <a href="http://fourthwall.creativecommons.org/honey/script">script</a> to soundtrack -- under Creative Commons<br />
licenses. Ball is opening up the free copying and trading (for noncommercial use) of the final film, but also encouraging<br />
film schools and aspiring editors and directors <a href="http://fourthwall.creativecommons.org/honey/whyremix">to re-interpret selected scenes</a> by digging into the<br />
raw footage and re-cutting it to their tastes. On the <a href="http://fourthwall.creativecommons.org/">new Fourth Wall Films website and blog</a> (which I highly<br />
recommend you check out and participate in, esp. if you do film), Ball <a href="http://fourthwall.creativecommons.org/honey/whycc">explains his decision</a> and calls for others to do the same:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to seed a movement, one where filmmakers and the filmgoing community<br />
are more directly linked, where people can make up their own minds, and where a diversity<br />
of voices can be heard-not just the voices a few hundred decision makers decide are<br />
 "marketable." So many times I heard from people that my movie was good, but not<br />
marketable. When I heard that, I realized something was wrong with the market. Here's to<br />
 making our own market. I hope Honey is a start.</p></blockquote>
