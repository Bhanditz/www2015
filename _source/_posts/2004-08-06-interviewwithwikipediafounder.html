Slashdot is carrying <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/28/1351230">a great interview with the founder</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>. Wikipedia is only about three and a half years old, but in that time it has already grown well beyond the size of most standard printed encyclopedias. In the interview, Jim Wales talks about how they manage all that content, how they collect and spend donations to keep it running, and what the future holds for Wikipedia. While Wikipedia isn't Creative Commons licensed content, it is licensed in a similar open fashion and this interview provides insight into what it takes to run a massive open and free content project.</p>
