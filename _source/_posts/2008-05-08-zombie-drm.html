<p>I hate to beat a dead horse, but the horse's promoters provide a convenient excuse when they claim the dead horse is making a comeback. The horse in question of course is <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9939189-7.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20">DRM</a> (emphasis added):<br />
<blockquote>"(Recently) I made a list of the 22 ways to sell music, and 20 of them still require DRM," said David Hughes, who heads up the RIAA's technology unit, during a panel discussion at the Digital Hollywood conference. "<b>Any form of subscription service</b> or limited play-per-view or advertising offer still <b>requires DRM</b>. So DRM is not dead.</p></blockquote>
<p>CC using record label Magnatune just <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8271">announced a DRM-free subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Another jewel from the same <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9939189-7.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20">News.com article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Fritz Attaway, executive vice president at the Motion Picture Association of America said: "We need DRM to show our customers the limits of the license they have entered into with us."</p></blockquote>
<p>If you needed DRM to <b>show</b> users the limits of a license, CC licenses would require DRM. Instead, CC licenses <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4369">repudiate</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8080">known forms of</a>) DRM. No, the only thing the RIAA and MPAA are showing their customers is disrespect.</p>
<p>Of course this is a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5160">really old story</a>.</p>
<p>We need <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7658">Digital Asset Management</a> tools that help our computers help us manage content, not <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/">DRM that turns our computers against us</a>.</p>
