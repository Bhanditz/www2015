<p>Musicians <a href="http://www.zenarchery.com/music/lsfb/">Joshua Ellis</a> and <a href="http://www.bigfriendlycorporation.com/music/">Big Friendly Corporation</a> have implemented a new technology called <a href="http://www.bitpass.com">BitPass</a> to sell their Creative Commons-licensed content via micropayment.</p>
<p>Joshua has offered his songs under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike</a> license. If you buy a song for 50 cents, or the entire album for $3.50, you're then free to copy, distribute, and make derivative works -- as long as you give Joshua attribution, don't make commercial uses, and release all derivative works under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike</a> license.  Joshua says he's sold over $100 of content within a few days.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in mixing these songs, or putting them into your student film?</p>
