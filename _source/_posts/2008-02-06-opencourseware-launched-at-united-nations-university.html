<p>The United Nations University, an official member of theÂ <a href="http://ocwconsortium.org/">OpenCourseWare Consortium</a>,Â has just launched their web learning portal. Joining more thanÂ <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=32">100</a>Â other institutions of higher education, UNU is providing open access to an initialÂ <a href="http://ocw.unu.edu/Courses_listing">dozen</a>Â training courses, spanning from subjects like Integrated Water Resources Management to the Social Construction of Technology in Development. Â The courses are aimed towards educators, students, and individuals--pretty much anyone who's interested.</p>
<p>Rather than replacing for-credit courses, the United Nations University recognizes the significance of different approaches to education in the 21st century. Â As a result, the courses are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 2.5 (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">CC BY</a>).</p>
