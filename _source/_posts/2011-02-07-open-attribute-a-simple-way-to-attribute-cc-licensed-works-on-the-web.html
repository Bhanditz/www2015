<p><a href="http://openattribute.com/">Open Attribute</a>, "a suite of tools that makes it ridiculously simple for anyone to copy and paste the correct attribution for any CC licensed work," launched today with browser add-ons for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. The add-ons "query the metadata around a CC-licensed object and produce a properly formatted attribution that users can copy and paste wherever they need to." </p>
<p>If you use our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">license chooser</a> and copy and paste the resulting HTML code into your website, then you're pretty much good to go. Anyone who uses the Open Attribute browser add-on to query your site will automatically receive a formatted HTML or plain text attribution that they can copy and paste to give you the proper credit. </p>
<p>Open Attribute uses CC REL metadata found in the pages to generate the attribution metadata. You might remember that we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/25962">developed</a> a guide with real examples to make CC REL metadata much easier to implement: <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/ccrel-guide">CC REL by Example</a> contains example HTML pages, as well as explanations and links to more information. If you're curious to see how Open Attribute pulls the metadata, the guide includes a specific section on <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/ccrel-guide/#Reuses">Attributing Reuses</a>. </p>
<p>Open Attribute is a direct result of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24497">Mozilla Drumbeat Festival</a> held last year in Barcelona on Learning, Freedom and the Web. See Molly Kleinman's post for a <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/2011/02/07/announcing-open-attribute/">more comprehensive run-down of</a> the origins and team behind Open Attribute.</p>
