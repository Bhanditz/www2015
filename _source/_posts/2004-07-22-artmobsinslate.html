<p>Slate is running <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2104087/">a piece today entitled "Art Mobs"</a> that takes a look at how collaboration between artists has changed as things move online. It covers graphical, film, and text pieces, but the best example is a song. </p>
<p>We've profiled <a href="http://www.macjams.com/">MacJams</a> before, the site built around sharing tracks for Apple's Garageband users. They've got Creative Commons licenses built in and this slate article highlights <a href="http://www.artsforge.com/mp3/rewired/boratezone4.mp3">the final track</a> "Please Eat." It is the fourth version of an earlier cut, and in the end four different musicians contributed 36 separate tracks to the final song.</p>
<p>I did some digging around and <a href="http://www.macjams.com/song/song_profile.php?lid=1311">here is the original track</a>, which is licensed under an Attribution license. If you'd like to further mash the track, <a href="http://www.macjams.com/song/song_profile.php?lid=1376">the final track</a> mentioned is under an Attribution-Noncommercial license.</p>
