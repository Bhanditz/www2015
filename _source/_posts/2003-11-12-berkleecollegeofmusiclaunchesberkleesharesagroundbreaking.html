<p>The world-renowned music college encourages people to share music lessons<br />
via file-sharing networks</p>
<p><strong>Boston, Massachusetts USA</strong> - Berklee College of Music,<br />
the world's largest independent music college and the premier institution<br />
for the study of contemporary music, announces the launch of Berklee<br />
Shares. The groundbreaking new program provides free music lessons under<br />
Creative Commons licenses and encourages musicians to share and<br />
distribute the lessons online. The Berklee Shares lessons consist of a<br />
growing catalog of MP3s, QuickTime movies, and PDF files derived from<br />
curriculum developed at the college by its world-renowned faculty. The<br />
lessons are available for download today at<br />
<a href="http://www.berkleeshares.com/">http://www.berkleeshares.com/</a>, affiliate partner sites, and<br />
peer-to-peer networks, including Limewire.</p>
<p>"Berklee Shares was born out of Berklee College of Music's commitment to<br />
furthering music education through innovative means," said Dave Kusek,<br />
Associate Vice President.  "Offering free education on the Internet and<br />
through file sharing networks underscores the college's core beliefs that<br />
these channels are an effective way to openly distribute meaningful<br />
educational content to a global audience, as well as serve as a powerful<br />
promotional platform for artists to market, distribute, and sell their<br />
music."</p>
<p>The Berklee Shares program launches with over 80 music lessons spanning<br />
instrument performance, music production and technology, songwriting and<br />
arranging, music business and careers, music education and improvisation.<br />
The number of lessons offered will expand over time. </p>
<p>"Berklee College of Music will prove to many the innovation and education<br />
that can be supported through a more balanced system of rights," said<br />
Lawrence Lessig, chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at<br />
Stanford University. "We are honored to help Berklee College spread<br />
educational content broadly."</p>
