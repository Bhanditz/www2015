<p>The Commonwealth of Learning (COL), an intergovernmental organization that "helps governments and institutions to expand the scope, scale and quality of learning," has defined a new <a href="http://www.col.org/progServ/policy/Pages/oer.aspx">policy on open educational resources (OER)</a>. In addition to recognizing the importance of OER for teaching, learning, and collaboration among institutions and governments, the Commonwealth of Learning states that it will "encourage and support governments and institutions to establish supportive policy frameworks to introduce practices relating to OER."</p>
<p>The new policy specifies that COL will "release its own materials under the most feasible open licenses including the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA license." The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> license is currently used for more than 17 million Wikipedia articles in 270 languages, not to mention a plethora of other <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Foundation projects</a>. Furthermore the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> license is compatible with CC BY-SA, and CC BY is used by OER platforms like <a href="http://cnx.org">Connexions</a> and <a href="http://curriki.org">Curriki.org</a>.</p>
<p>We are thrilled at this new development by COL, one of the leading intergovernmental organizations in education! Read the full policy <a href="http://www.col.org/progServ/policy/Pages/oer.aspx">here</a>, and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/IGO">learn more</a> about how IGOs benefit by adopting Creative Commons licenses for their own works.</p>
