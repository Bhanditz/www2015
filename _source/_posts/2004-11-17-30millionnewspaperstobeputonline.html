<p>Great news for the public domain: <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/apwashington_story.asp?category=1155&slug=Old%20Newspapers">The National Endowment for the Arts and the Library of Congress are putting 30 million newspaper pages online, dating from 1836 to 1922</a>.</p>
<p>It'll take until 2006 to complete the project but the Library of Congress has put up <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/sgphtml/sashtml/sashome.html">a sample from The Stars and Stripes</a>, an armed forces paper, posting every issue from 1918-1919.</p>
