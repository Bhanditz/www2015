<p>As you might already be aware, Creative Commons' fifth anniversary celebration is next month. This milestone provides us with a great opportunity to let the world know about all of the amazing things our community has accomplished over the past few years. As such, we're looking for a public relations expert to work with us on a program to get the most media impact out of our anniversary as possible. </p>
<p>We're looking for someone to start working with us on this ASAP, so if you or someone you know has solid PR experience (as well as significant familiarity with CC's community and work), please take a look at our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities/#pr">proposal request</a> and send us some information about how you'd help us fulfill our goals.</p>
