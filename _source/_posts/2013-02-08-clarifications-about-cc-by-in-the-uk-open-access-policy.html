<p>In the UK, the House of Commons <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/news/committee-announces-an-inquiry-into-open-access/">has asked for feedback</a> on their Open Access Policy. One provision of that policy requires that articles funded through the Research Councils UK (RCUK) must be released under a CC BY license. Last year, CC submitted a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RCUK_comments">short comment</a> in support. </p>
<p>And just last month, the House of Lords completed a consultation period which has <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/science-technology/Openaccess/OpenAccessevidence.pdf">generated some misinformation</a> about how the CC BY license operates. So, in order to clarify some of these misconceptions, Creative Commons and <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.uk/">Creative Commons UK</a> submitted a joint response to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee to set the record straight. </p>
<p>We've <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/BIS_committee_UK_OA_Policy">pulled together some clarifications</a> to some of the uncertainty lobbed at the CC BY license provision in the Open Access Policy. Some of the reasons given that CC BY should not be retained include:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would promote "misuse of research or would cause authors to "lose control of their work"</li>
<li>third party rights negotiations for content that authors wish to include within an openly licensed article would prove too difficult</li>
<li>open licensing provides less protection against plagiarism</li>
<li>CC BY is not widely used in OA publishing</li>
<li>authors should choose licensing conditions, not funders</li>
</ul>
<p>These claims are confusing, misguided, or not backed up by evidence. We offer our responses and support <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/BIS_committee_UK_OA_Policy">here</a>. </p>
