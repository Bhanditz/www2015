<p><a href="http://www.evoca.com">Evoca</a> is a new service that helps you record audio via their web application, phone, or skype (you can also upload a .mp3 or .wav file) and allows people to choose a CC license or public domain dedication for their recordings. Many people seem to be doing just that!</p>
