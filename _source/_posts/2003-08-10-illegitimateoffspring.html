<p><a href="http://salon.com">Salon</a> has two good stories this weekend on mash-ups (also known, across the pond, as "bastard pop"): <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2003/08/09/mashups_taylor/index.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2003/08/09/mashups_cruger/index.html">2</a>.</p>
<p>These older Salon stories on the same subject, from <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/01/bootlegs/print.html">2002</a> and <a href="http://archive.salon.com/21st/reviews/1998/04/02review.html">1998</a>, provide a couple of nice reference points. If this is all just a trend, it's a sure and steady one.</p>
