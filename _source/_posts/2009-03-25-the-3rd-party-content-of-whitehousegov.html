<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/24/Open-for-Questions-President-Obama-to-Answer-Your-Questions-on-Thursday/"><img src="img/picture-2.png" alt="Whitehouse.gov" title="Whitehouse.gov" width="193" height="34" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12271" /></a>When <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12267">Whitehouse.gov relaunched itself during Barack Obama's inauguration</a> it included a clause in its <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/copyright">copyright policy mandating that all 3rd party content</a> on the site be released under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a> license. Until yesterday, there wasn't much third party content on the site. However, as of this writing, 13,785 people have submitted 16,561 questions and cast 508,450 votes in the site's "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/OpenForQuestions/">Open For Questions</a>" section.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/24/Open-for-Questions-President-Obama-to-Answer-Your-Questions-on-Thursday/">President Obama will answer some of these questions on Thursday morning in a special online town hall</a>. </p>
<p>While the copyright status of each individual question may not seem significant, all of the questions taken in aggregate are of unquestionable value for current and future generations of journalists, historians and citizens. By placing this corpus under our most permissive license, the Obama Administration has secured that the public will always have access to this unprecedented part of American presidential history.</p>
