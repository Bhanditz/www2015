<p>Some very exciting news for music fans: Tonight, Nine Inch Nails released <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/"><em>Ghosts I-IV</em></a>, a collection of 36 new instrumental tracks that are available to the world under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">BY-NC-SA</a> license.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="sectionContent"> This music arrived unexpectedly as the result of an experiment. The rules were as follows: 10 weeks, no clear agenda, no overthinking, everything driven by impulse. Whatever happens during that time gets released as... something.</p>
<p class="sectionContent">â€¦</p>
<p>The end result is a wildly varied body of music that we're able to present to the world in ways the confines of a major record label would never have allowed - from a 100% DRM-free, high-quality download, to the most luxurious physical package we've ever created.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll have a lot more to say about this exciting development very soon. In the meantime, <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/main/more_info">read more</a> about the project and check out <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/main/order_options">the music</a>!</p>
