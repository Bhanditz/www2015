<p>Two new additions to our site help explain the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/how1">how</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/comics1">why</a> of using our licenses.</p>
<p>These comics walk the Creative Commons walk:  our very own Neeru Paharia built them from Ryan Junell's original artwork, which debuted in our <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org">Flash movie</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0">Creative Commons license</a>, and from photographs taken and licensed by our webmaster Matt Haughey.</p>
