<p>Tomorrow, Saturday September 15, is <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">Software Freedom Day</a>, a "worldwide celebration of Free and Open Source Software." Hundreds of teams around the globe will be holding local events to promote software freedom. Search for a <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/teams">team</a> near you. </p>
<p>Creative Commons supports free software and actively develops a number of free software <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cctools">projects</a>. Tomorrow would be a great day to hack on some CC software, maybe work on a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/HOWTO_Patch">patch</a> or try your hand at a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges">developer challenge</a>. Visit the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer">developer</a> page on our wiki for more ways to get involved!</p>
