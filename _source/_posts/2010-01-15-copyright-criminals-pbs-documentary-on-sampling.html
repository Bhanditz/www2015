<p><img src="img/cc_header_logo.png" alt="" title="cc_header_logo" width="240" style="float:right;padding-left:10px" /><em><a href="http://www.copyrightcriminals.com/">Copyright Criminals</a></em> is a new documentary on the rise of sampling, specifically in hip-hop music, and the cultural and legal effects it has caused. From the <em>Copyright Criminals</em> <a href="http://www.copyrightcriminals.com/about">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Copyright Criminals examines the creative and commercial value of musical sampling, including the related debates over artistic expression, copyright law, and (of course) money.</p>
<p>This documentary traces the rise of hip-hop from the urban streets of New York to its current status as a multibillion-dollar industry. For more than thirty years, innovative hip-hop performers and producers have been re-using portions of previously recorded music in new, otherwise original compositions. When lawyers and record companies got involved, what was once referred to as a â€œborrowed melodyâ€ became a â€œcopyright infringement.â€The film showcases many of hip-hop musicâ€™s founding figures like Public Enemy, De La Soul, and Digital Undergroundâ€”while also featuring emerging hip-hop artists from record labels Definitive Jux, Rhymesayers, Ninja Tune, and more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The film will be broadcast publicly on PBS this Tuesday night, January 19th so be sure to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/broadcast.html">check your local listings</a> for time. You can get a taste of what is in store by watching the film's <a href="http://www.copyrightcriminals.com/trailer">trailer</a> and starting January 26th you will be able <a href="http://www.copyrightcriminals.com/purchase">purchase</a> the film on DVD.</p>
