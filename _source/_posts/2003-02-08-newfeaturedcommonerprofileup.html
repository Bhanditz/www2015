<blockquote>Free trading of our music has genuine, verifiable returns. Community. Exchanges of artistic thought and aesthetic commodity. . . The RIAA argument that artists won't particpate in the marketplace of ideas without financial compensation for CDs seems pretty short-sighted from where we sit.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We recently <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/features/musicians">sat down for an interview</a> with members of <a href="http://dealerkids.com/">Dealership</a> and <a href="http://walkingbirds.com/">The Walkingbirds</a>. These independent, unsigned musicians with a small following of fans shared their thoughts and concerns about music online.</p>
