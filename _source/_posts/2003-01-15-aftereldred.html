<p>The Supreme Court has ruled 7-2 against the petitioners in Eldred v. Ashcroft.  (See Lessig's <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/">blog</a> and the <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/">Eldred</a> site for official news and responses.)</p>
<p>What now?  Creative Commons marches on as before, but with a pronounced sensitivity to the need to offer copyright holders who want to forgo long or broad copyright protections a simple way of doing so -- whether by dedicating works to the public domain, or allowing the creative re-use of copyrighted works with our licenses.</p>
