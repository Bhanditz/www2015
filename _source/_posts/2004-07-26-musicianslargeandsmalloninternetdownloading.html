<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/07/20/peter.gabriel/">CNN is currently carrying an interesting interview with musician Peter Gabriel</a>. Gabriel always seems to be at the bleeding edge of technology, and he describes two of his net music ventures, <a href="http://www.ondemanddistribution.com/eng/home/home.asp">On Demand Distribution</a>, a backend company that works on music payment and fulfillment systems, and his pet project with Brian Eno, <a href="http://www.mudda.org/">The Magnificent Union of Digitally Downloading Artists</a>.</p>
<p>When asked why he has embraced the internet while record companies have feared it, Gabriel says:</p>
<blockquote><p>A new world is being created -- one is dying -- and if artists don't get involved, they're going to get screwed, like they usually do.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the other end of the musician spectrum, indie rock artists <a href="http://www.themountaingoats.net/">The Mountain Goats</a> recently gave <a href="http://www.archive.org/audio/etree-band-details.php?band=Mountain%20Goats">their stamp of approval</a> to the Internet Archive's hosting of <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Mountain%20Goats%22">their live shows</a>. Frontman John Darnielle shares why he supports it:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am totally in favor of tape trading, and file sharing never did anything wrong by me. People got into The Mountain Goats after downloading my stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's great to see a superstar like Peter Gabriel continue to embrace and extend technology and it's also great to see a small artist like The Mountain Goats realize new avenues to gain fans.</p>
