<p>Sep 18, 2002 -- <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">www.creativecommons.org</a><br />
-- Creative Commons today announced its newly formed leadership<br />
team, expanding its efforts to cultivate a vibrant public<br />
domain within the current copyright system.</p>
<p>
Founding Executive Director Molly Shaffer Van Houweling<br />
recently completed her long-planned transition from Creative<br />
Commons to become Assistant Professor at the University<br />
of Michigan Law School and member of the Creative Commons<br />
Board of Directors.</p>
<p>"We are proud to have had Molly lead the team to where it<br />
is today - her extraordinary contributions helped make Creative<br />
Commons a reality," said Creative Commons Chairman Lawrence<br />
Lessig. "Our new management's impressive track record will<br />
help bring our efforts to a new level by bridging the copyright<br />
world with the public domain and removing barriers to creativity.<br />
We are poised for tremendous success."</p>
<p>Former Deputy Director Glenn Otis Brown, now Executive Director,<br />
has worked closely with Van Houweling to ensure a smooth<br />
transfer of responsibilities that include overseeing the<br />
organization's strategic, technical, and development activities.</p>
<p>Brown joined Creative Commons early 2002, having worked<br />
for the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Miami and<br />
the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law<br />
School. He is a published author on copyright issues with<br />
works appearing in The Economist, the Harvard Law Review,<br />
and The New Republic.</p>
<p>"The founding team raised awareness about the unexplored<br />
possibilities for interplay between copyright and the public<br />
domain," said Brown. "We are now focused on helping the<br />
public take part in this mission. We're excited about launching<br />
our copyright licenses free of charge this autumn; soon<br />
people will be able to express a preference for sharing<br />
their work on their own terms."</p>
<p>Other additions to the management team are:</p>
<p>- Associate Director Neeru Paharia, formerly of McKinsey<br />
&amp; Company and Coro Fellow in Public Affairs. A noted<br />
filmmaker, illustrator, and blues guitar player, her work<br />
has been showcased in various film festivals and publications.<br />
Paharia received her Master of Science in Public Policy<br />
and Management with a concentration in Information Systems<br />
from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>- Consulting Technical Director Ben Adida, founder and CTO<br />
of open source technology consultancy Open Force. Best known<br />
as co-founder of ArsDigita, Adida helped develop the ArsDigita<br />
Community System, the first free toolkit for building collaborative<br />
database-backed Web sites. Adida received his Master and<br />
Bachelor degrees in Computer Science from MIT. His writings<br />
have appeared in IEEE Internet Computing, IEEE Software,<br />
and Open Magazine.</p>
<p>- Consulting Communications Director Sally Khudairi, communications<br />
strategist for the Apache Software Foundation and Web Standards<br />
Project. Active in the Web for nearly a decade, she directed<br />
communications strategies for some of the industry's most<br />
prominent specifications, including XML, HTML 3.2 and 4.0,<br />
and HTTP/1.1. Khudairi is a leading proponent for emerging<br />
initiatives such as the Semantic Web, Web Services and Intellectual<br />
Property Rights.</p>
