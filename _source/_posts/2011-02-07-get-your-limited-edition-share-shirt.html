<p>This is a great way to show your support for CC's mission to realize the full potential of the Internet â€” universal access to research, education, full participation in culture, and driving a new era of development, growth, and productivity. </p>
<p>Imaginary Foundation already believes in the power of the Internet and a more participatory culture:</p>
<p><em>"Sharing is the mechanism that propels culture forward. Cultural evolution, like its biological counterpart, is driven by random mutation. This process of recombination, iteration and sharing enables the stickiest ideas to survive. When we share, it is as though the global imagination is breathing. To inhale is to be nourished by inspirationâ€“to exhale is to evoke it."</em> - The Director, Imaginary Foundation</p>
<p>Join Imaginary Foundation and Creative Commons in showing how much we can accomplish when we share! <a href="https://creativecommons.net/store">Get your limited edition shirt today</a>. </p>
