<p>The <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a>'s launch date is nearing, and there's a party in Brooklyn this Saturday, April 4, to celebrate. If you're not yet familiar with the project, the FMA is an online music library developed by the legendaryÂ freeform radio station <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/">WFMU</a> and curated by partners including <a href="http://kexp.org/" target="_blank"><span>KEXP</span></a> and <a href="http://dublab.com/" target="_blank"><span>Dublab</span></a>. From FMA's Jason Sigal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every track [on the FMA] will be offered in high-quality without restrictions, registration, advertisements or fees. Many grant additional rights under <a href="../" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> agreements, making the FMA a valuable resource for podcasters, video producers, remix artists, and others in search of legal audio.Â  [â€¦] Radio has always offered free access to curated audio, and the Free Music Archive is a continuation of that purpose designed for the Internet era.</p></blockquote>
<p>Saturday's party (see full details below) will have live performances by a bunch of great bands - Thee Oh Sees, Excepter, Sightings, and Pink Skull (mp3s by all of the acts who are playing are available <a href="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/03/sightings-added-to-saturdays-wfmu-free-music-archive-concert-w-thee-oh-sees-excepter-pink-skull-mp3s.html">here</a>) - plus a DJ set from WFMU music director Brian Turner. WFMU will broadcast live from the event at 91.1-FM in New York and <a href="http://wfmu.org/" target="_blank">wfmu.org</a>. Live recordings from the concert will be made available for download at the Free Music Archive.</p>
