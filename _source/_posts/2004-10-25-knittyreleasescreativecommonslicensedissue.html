In case you hadn't heard, knitting's all the rage and has been for crafty hipsters for years (last xmas I got my first knitted scarf as a gift). One of the best sources for information and patterns is <a href="http://knitty.com/">Knitty</a>. For the past two years, they have put out quarterly issues that feature about a dozen project how-tos, stories, and articles about knitting. </p>
<p>For Breast Cancer Awareness Month, they put out <a href="http://www.marblehead.net/amy/knittyF04surp.pdf">a special print (PDF) issue</a> that featured projects specifically tailored to those living with cancer and a story from a survivor. For this special benefit issue, the folks at Knitty wanted to send it far and wide. To help them let readers know they are free to share this issue on their own site, they've added a Creative Commons license.
