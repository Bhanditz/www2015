<p>A little while ago, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5645">blogged about</a> Wired's article about The Lonely Island, LA-based comedy collective, who were recently signed to work with the Saturday Night Live team after releasing their Awesometown comedy pilot under a Creative Commons license. CC recently caught up with "the dudes" in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/video/lonelyisland">our new Featured Commoner interview</a>.</p>
