<p>It's official. In California, Governor Jerry Brown <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=17760">has signed</a> two bills (<a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1051-1100/sb_1052_bill_20120905_enrolled.html">SB 1052</a> and <a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1051-1100/sb_1053_bill_20120905_enrolled.html">SB 1053</a>) that will provide for the creation of free, openly licensed digital textbooks for the 50 most popular lower-division college courses offered by California colleges. The legislation was introduced by Senate President pro Tem Darrell Steinberg and passed by the California Senate and Assembly in late August.</p>
<p>A crucial component of the California legislation is that the textbooks developed will be made available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> (CC BY):</p>
<blockquote><p>The textbooks and other materials are placed under a creative commons attribution license that allows others to use, distribute, and create derivative works based upon the digital material while still allowing the authors or creators to receive credit for their efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CC BY license allows teachers to tailor textbook content to students' needs, permits commercial companies to take the resources and build new products with it (such as video tutorials), and opens the doors for collaboration and improvement of the materials. </p>

<p>Access to affordable textbooks is extremely important for students, as <a href="http://20mm.org/infographic-open-source-impact.html">textbook costs continue to rise</a> at four times the rate of inflation, sometimes surpassing the cost of tuition at some community colleges. So, in addition to making the digital textbooks available to students free of cost, the legislation requires that print copies of textbooks will cost about $20. </p>
<p>This is a massive win for California, and a most welcome example of open policy that aims to leverage open licensing to save money for California families and support the needs of teachers and students.
