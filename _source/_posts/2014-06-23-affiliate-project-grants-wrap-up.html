<p>One year ago, CC announced the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Affiliate_Project_Grants">Affiliate Project Grants</a> to support and expand CCâ€™s global network of dedicated experts. With a little help from Google, we were able to increase the capacity of CCâ€™s Affiliates to undertake projects around the world benefiting a more free, open, and innovative internet.</p>
<p>We received over 70 applicants, and we were <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/39505">able to fund 18</a> to tackle important work in their country - work like using music to break down physical barriers and give Palestinians a voice, gathering leaders in Tanzania to discuss how sharing information can help prevent diabetes, and helping Romanian librarians provide quality educational materials to all.</p>
<p>Watching these projects unfold over the last several months has been reaffirming for everyone at CC. The Affiliates are central to CCâ€™s work, without whom we would simply not be closer to our goal of a more open internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Affiliate_Project_Grants#Recipient_Final_Reports">Click here</a> to find out the full details of the different grants, and read on to see what our 18 teams had to say on the <a href="#results">results they achieved</a>,  <a href="#motivations">motivations for their projects</a>,  <a href="#work">the work still to be done</a>, and  <a href="#lessons">lessons learned</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">â€œWe are pleased that we were able to impact the way the people who shared their stories with us think about the concept of sharing stories. Some people when they were asked before to share their suffering and their personal stories on video were not totally sure they wanted to do it, but after seeing the output of their stories reflected on by poets and artists from all over the world, we think we were able to provide them a platform to express themselves and feel part of a greater community that is sharing the same hopes and fears.<br />
[We want to expand] the project concept to other marginalized communities around the world.â€<br />

<p align="center">"Museums and other memory institutions in Taiwan often have their collections digitized.<br />
A major part of the digitized works shall be in the public domain. However, many of these institutions often keep these works in the equivalents of digital safes, and there are no easy ways to access and reuse them. Together with Netivism Ltd. (a social enterprise based in Taipei) CC Taiwan engaged with memory institutions and independent collectors in Taiwan about the tools and practices for public domain repositories.<br />
Exemplary public domain repositories are being setup using MediaGoblin (a free software package for hosting media collections) with new extensions developed for and supported by this project grant."<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Motivations</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">â€œDespite all the work we have done, CC is still an unknown concept to most people in the Arab region. We live in a copy/paste region where it will take a lot of hard work for people to understand the concepts of attribution. After a series of CC presentations in local schools (ages 12 to 18), we found that CC awareness is almost non-existent. On the other hand, our videos at <a href="http://www.wezank.com">wezank.com</a> have been very popular online and we believe that using this asset to spread CC's mission &amp; vision would be highly effective across the region. [... This project] is about creating content in Arabic for the CC community, and at any stage, anyone wishing to present CC in Arabic will be able to use those videos.â€<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">"[Information is power]... In Africa, this rich geography of information doesnâ€™t yet exist.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">"If the government [in Japan] adopts CC BY or CC zero, data released under these terms will bring scalable impact on the public in a sense that it will help reuse of government data with minimum restrictions. The workshop materials are open to the public, and some of the attendees will learn to teach others, which give the project some ripple effects beyond its immediate outcomes."<br />

[...] The material in this course will be open as a self-guided course that can be tapped on demand â€” individually, at a user-preferred time and date. Moreover, the course can be harnessed as a group, from a collective or specific institution, to be facilitated according to the possibilities and conditions of a given community."<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">"The conclusion of this project is that there are only building blocks for Open Educational Resources (OER) in Romania since at the moment there is not a clear OER practice - only grassroots initiatives or projects with huge potential of becoming OER. Most of the projects we discovered in essence share the same philosophy behind OER, but they nevertheless omit to attribute a license for the created resources. In conclusion, more awareness and training activities are needed in order to reach a level of maturity regarding OER and their use."<br />
