<p>I'm attending the O'Reilly Open Source Convention this week in Portland, OR.  The convention tutorials got started yesterday, and there's great blog coverage, <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/oscon/index.cgi?BlogCoverage">cataloged here</a>.  I'll be attending tutorials today, and then the conference sessions for the remainder of the week.  Track me down, tell me why you love CC and I'll shower you with schwag.  And by shower I mean "give you a button and a bumper sticker."</p>
