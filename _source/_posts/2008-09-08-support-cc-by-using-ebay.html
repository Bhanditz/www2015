Check out this cool new way to support CC by using <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>:</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.ebaygivingworks.com/">eBay Giving Works</a>, powered by the nonprofit <a href="http://www.missionfish.org/">MissionFish</a>, you can now sell items on eBay and donate up to 100% of the final sale price to Creative Commons. All you have to do is select Creative Commons as the benefitting nonprofit organization for your item, and the listing will appear on eBay with a special logo indicating it's for sale to benefit a good cause. When the item sells, MissionFish will collect the selected donation amount, send it to CC, and provide you with a tax receipt.  </p>
<p>To find out more or to get started, visit the <a href="http://www.ebaygivingworks.com/">eBay Giving Works Web site</a>. You can also visit the UK version, <a href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/ebayforcharity/">eBay for Charity</a>.</p>
<p>As always, we are grateful to have such an enthusiastic and dedicated community of supporters working with us to build a global digital commons. Thank you for making our work possible!</p>
