<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26636">announced</a> that Creative Commons is <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/2011/02/16/creative-commons-sponsors-wikisym-2011/">an official sponsor</a> of the 7th annual <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/ws2011">WikiSym</a>, the International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration. WikiSym is taking place right near Creative Commons headquarters in Mountain View, CA on October 3-5 at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/siliconvalley/default.aspx">Microsoft Research Campus</a> in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>WikiSym is the premier conference on open collaboration and related technologies for researchers, industry, entrepreneurs and practitioners worldwide. It is supported by relevant organizations and companies such as Microsoft, Wikimedia Foundation, Creative Commons, the National Science Foundation, and CosmoCode. As an Associate Partner and like-minded organization concerned about the instrumental role of open content and open licenses in today's society, Creative Commons supports WikiSym to further disseminate the goals of this forum among their audience around the world.</p>
<p>Key topics in WikiSym include open collaboration and related technologies, open content, open licenses and their connections and implications for different areas of interest (education, e-democracy, data transparency and industry). A <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/San_Francisco_Salon">CC Salon on Open Educational Resources</a> organized in San Francisco in June already served as a preview of some interesting discussions in this field that will be developed at the conference.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/ws2011/program:schedule">conference program</a> is packed with presentations, workshops, panels, demos and keynotes. Alongside is the <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/2010/08/24/five-years-of-open-space-at-wikisym/">Open Space</a>, an unconference track in which attendees can self-organize their own agenda with discussions, presentations and informal gatherings.</p>
<p>This year, WikiSym is proud to host <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/ws2011/program:keynotes">3 outstanding keynotes</a> by world-renowned figures in their fields.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cathy Casserly (CEO @ Creative Commons)</strong> will talk about the forthcoming challenges for open content and open licenses, with special emphasis in their implications for the critical field of educational content.
</li>
<li><strong>Jeff Heer (Assistant Professor @ Stanford)</strong> will present a tour around the most compelling and innovative advances in information visualization (InfoViz), a field that is evolving rapidly, along with the emergence of open data sources, public transparency and data analysis.
</li>
<li><strong>Bernardo Huberman (Senior HP Fellow and Director of the Social Computing Lab @ Hewlett-Packard Laboratories)</strong> will emphasize the implication of the latest advances in the study of virtual communities, distributed systems and dynamics of information in large networks to understand the way open collaboration will likely evolve in the future.	</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.wikisym.org/ws2011/attend:start">WikiSym 2011 registration</a> is still open. Don't miss this unparalleled opportunity to tap into the latest trends and ground-breaking advances in open collaboration--the force that is reshaping the way we work, live and interact with each other everyday.</p>
