<h2>About the Association for Technology and Internet</h2>
<p>APTI is an independent Romanian NGO that has the scope to promote the fair use of information society services in agreement with the legal norms in force. We are looking to promote the human rights in the digital environment and support the digital civil rights in the Romanian society</p>
<p>APTI is not a professional or business organization. Our members come from different environments with interests and implications in various activities on the Internet. We believe that our association is ensuring a legal framework where someoneâ€™s opinion regarding the development of good electronic services in Romania can become public and be supported by several people interested in the same ideas.</p>
<p>Our activities range from policy and legal opinions on the current regulations involving the information society services and the Internet in Romania, to concrete actions to stop the Romanian Spam or to provide advice regarding the safe use of Internet for children.</p>
<p>APTI is a member of EDRI (European Digital Rights Initiative).</p>
<p>More information about APTI is available at <a href="http://www.apti.ro/">http://www.apti.ro/</a></p>
