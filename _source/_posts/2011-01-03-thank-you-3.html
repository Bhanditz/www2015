<p>Thanks to all our supporters who helped us raise over $500,000 for our annual fundraising campaign! Stay tuned for a precise total and analysis -- we're still counting mailed checks! If you didn't get a chance to donate to the 2010 campaign, start 2011 off right by showing the world how much <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">you appreciate CC</a>. </p>
<p>Because of our supporters, we will be able to continue developing the necessary tools to support and facilitate participatory culture and innovation around the world. 2011 is going to be a big year for CC - <a href="https://creativecommons.net/civicrm/mailing/subscribe?reset=1&gid=121">stay in touch</a> and keep sharing! </p>
