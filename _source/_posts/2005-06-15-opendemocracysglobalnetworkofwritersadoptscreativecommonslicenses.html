<p>San Francisco, USA & London, UK â€“ June 14, 2005></p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible<br />
 copyright licenses for authors and artists, and openDemocracy.net, an<br />
 independent online magazine for debate about global politics, today unveiled a new<br />
 partnership to bring works by the worldâ€™s leading scholars and writers into the<br />
 global commons.</p>
<p>openDemocracy.net is the first online publisher of its size and caliber to adopt<br />
 Creative Commons licensing. Starting today, members of the public will be free to<br />
 republish most articles on the openDemocracy.net site in any non-commercial publication in<br />
 the world. â€œThis move embodies the democratic values we champion,â€ says openDemocracyâ€™s<br />
 editor  Isabel Hilton.</p>
<p>Since 2001 openDemocracy.net has published more than 2,600 articles by<br />
 writers from around the world on issues relating to democracy, politics and<br />
 culture. Contributors include scholars, journalists, policymakers and<br />
 politicians. openDemocracy.net today released the work of 150 existing authors<br />
 under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license. All<br />
 future authors will be encouraged to publish their work under this new default<br />
 license, although they will also be free to opt for traditional â€œAll rights<br />
 reservedâ€ level of copyright, or an even more permissive Creative Commons<br />
 license instead.</p>
<p>Chairman & CEO of Creative Commons, Lawrence Lessig, said â€œIt is   exciting<br />
 that the important content published in openDemocracy will be able<br />
 to freely circulate around the globe and assist in spreading the ideas and<br />
 arguments of its contributors. Creative Commons is honored that openDemocracy<br />
 felt that Creative Commons licenses were suitable for this purpose.â€</p>
<p>About openDemocracy.net</p>

 globe, and include some of the most respected writers and scholars from across<br />
 the political spectrum. Past contributors include Todd Gitlin, Mary<br />

 Vaidhyanathan. Visit: <a href="http://www.openDemocracy.net">opendemocracy</a></p>
