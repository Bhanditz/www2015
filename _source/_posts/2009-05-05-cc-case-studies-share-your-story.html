<p><em>Creative Commons kicks off its global case studies effort. Share your story. Discover new works and new models.</em></p>
<p>With upwards of <a title="Metrics" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics">150 million CC-licensed works</a> published from <a class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org/international" href="../international">every corner of the world</a>, no single use case can tell the whole story. Creators and users come to CC for different reasons, and for many, CC solves different problems. Weâ€™re trying to capture the diversity of CC creators and content by building a resource that inspires new works and informs free culture.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons Case Studies 2009</strong> kicks off today â€“ and we want to hear your story! Weâ€™re collecting cases big and small on our re-launched <a title="Case Studies" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies wiki</a>, an online portal to upload and discover documentation about CC-licensed projects.</p>
<p>The top community curated stories will be featured on our website and in the next printed volume of <em>Creative Commons Case Studies</em>. You'll also collaborate with our CEO, Joi Ito, whose doctoral work focuses on select case studies about CC and the sharing economy.</p>
<p><em>How to get involved</em></p>
<ul>
<li> Visit the <a title="Case Studies" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies wiki</a> and learn about how people are using CC licenses around the world. Browse existing studies and download <a class="external text" title="http://creativecommons.org.au/casestudiesvol1" href="http://creativecommons.org.au/casestudiesvol1">Building an Australasian Commons: Creative Commons Case Studies Volume I</a>, a stunning publication edited by Rachel Cobcroft and supported by CC Australia. The book highlights 60 exemplary CC-licensed users in Australasia and worldwide. Source files and PDFs are available for the entire book and easily digestible booklets covering particular fields.</li>
<li> Curate a collection of case studies with <a title="Case Studies/PrediaPress" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/PrediaPress">PediaPress</a>, a service that builds an OpenOffice document, PDF, or printed book from selected wiki pages. Publish your collection on a site that supports CC licenses such as <a title="Scribd" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Scribd">Scribd</a>.  Tailor the material to meet your needs and add your entry to <a title="Case Studies/Collections" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Collections">list of case study collections</a>.</li>
<li> Teach with real-life examples. Weâ€™re encouraging educators to follow CC Australiaâ€™s lead and integrate the CC Case Studies into their curricula. Teaching with case studies is compelling and instructive. Have your students analyze existing studies or write their own.</li>
<li> Most importantly, <a title="Case Studies" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">add your CC story</a>, or one you're familiar with. Improve, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Roadmap#Ongoing">categorize, and assess</a> existing case studies. We're particularly interested in the addition of data relevant to the cases.</li>
