<p>Ten years after the release of the <a href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a>, OA advocates last week <a href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations">released updated recommendations</a> in support of open access around the world, touching on areas including policy, licensing, sustainability, and advocacy. Of particular interest are recommendations that urge funders to require open access when they make grants: "When possible, funder policies should require libre OA, preferably under a CC-BY license or equivalent." When funding agencies institute open access policies for the grant funds they distribute, they increase the impact of the research produced. This is because the outputs can be widely reused under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY license</a>, which allows for reuse for any purpose (even commercial) so long as attribution is given to the author. </p>
<p>The updated recommendation document includes a section on licensing and reuse (see the three listed below). The document "recommend[s] CC-BY or an equivalent license as the optimal license for the publication, distribution, use, and reuse of scholarly work."</p>
<blockquote><p>OA repositories typically depend on permissions from others, such as authors or publishers, and are rarely in a position to require open licenses. However, policy makers in a position to direct deposits into repositories should require open licenses, preferably CC-BY, when they can.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>OA journals are always in a position to require open licenses, yet most of them do not yet take advantage of the opportunity. We recommend CC-BY for all OA journals.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In developing strategy and setting priorities, we recognize that gratis access is better than priced access, libre access is better than gratis access, and libre under CC-BY or the equivalent is better than libre under more restrictive open licenses. We should achieve what we can when we can. We should not delay achieving gratis in order to achieve libre, and we should not stop with gratis when we can achieve libre.</p></blockquote>
