<p>To all the people that came out to the <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/fieldwork/sxsw_good_party1">GOOD - CC</a> party this past Monday - <strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p>
<p>The party was amazing. Truly. And rumor has it that it was also phenomenally successful in terms of dollars raised for CC. I will let you know what kind of numbers we're talking about as soon as they come in from the awesome people at <a href="http://goodmagazine.com">GOOD</a>.</p>
<p>All in all an epic night full of wonderful people, conversations, and dance moves. Thank you. We are honored to be surrounded by such a supportive community.</p>
<p>So to <a href="http://goodmagazine.com">GOOD Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.moli.com/">Moli</a>, <a href="http://sixapart.com">Six Apart</a>, <a href="http://www.phi-phenomenon.com/">VJ Phi Phenomenon</a> for his super cool live interactive video (all CC licensed content), <a href="http://www.myspace.com/turbotito">DJ Filip Turbotito</a>, <a href="http://www.misshapes.com">The MisShapes</a>, and of course you - thank you.</p>
