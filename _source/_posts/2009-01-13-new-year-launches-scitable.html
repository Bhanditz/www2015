<p>Happy new year. With the recent publication of "<a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/cclearn-reports">What status for open? An examination of the licensing policies of open educational projects and organizations</a>" and the holiday following forthwith, we've been a bit mum on the various open education goings on out there. You've heard of most of them via the usual blog channels, but one we'd like to briefly point out is <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/about"><em>Nature Education</em></a>'s launch of <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable"><em>Scitable</em></a>, an online resource for undergraduate biology students and their related educators. It's <em>Nature Education</em>'s first product launch of its kind (for those few of you who don't know, <a href="http://www.nature.com/"><em>Nature</em></a> is one of the top academic science publications out there), and according to their <a href="https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/4736.html">press release</a>, "Scitable provides students with free online access to more than 180 overviews of key genetics concepts" which are "evidence-based and have been vetted by Nature Publishing Group staff. By connecting with other Scitable users via groups, chat functionality and other social media features, students can collaborate online with classmates, or with a wider community of experts, researchers and fellow students."</p>
<p>It sounds pretty neat, and with <em>Nature</em>'s credibility, the site is robust with great information, specifically in the field of genetics. Some of the stuff might even be CC licensed, according to their <a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/viewTermsOfUse">terms of use</a>:</p>
<p>"Occasionally, material within the Site which is designated Â© Nature Education may also be designated as distributable under special license terms (for example only, "Â© Nature Education - This article is available under a <strong>Creative Commons Non-Commercial ND SA license</strong>"). Such material is exempt from the general restrictions outlined above and is instead subject to the specific terms of the referenced license."</p>
<p>That's good news, but wouldn't it be great if <em>everything</em> on the site was licensed openly? It is a site designed mainly for students and faculty after all; Nature should encourage adaptation of the information to make it better; who better to do that but academics and students who study the stuff? But regardless of allowing improvement and adaptation of the information, the site (as currently designed) doesn't really encourage the easy sharing of the info, even among the site's users. Moreover, even if there are open licenses attached to uploaded content, it isn't clear how people would know that (or indicate so in the upload process).</p>
<p>In any case, it's exciting that <em>Nature Education</em> is at least getting their feet wet in the land of OER. We hope they wade in farther soon, perhaps by allowing derivatives!</p>
