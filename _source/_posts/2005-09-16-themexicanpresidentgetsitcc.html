<p>Leon & Jorge from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.mx/">CC Mexico team</a> have been working with representatives of the Presidency of Mexico so that some of the Internet radio shows that are streamed and podcast by the <a href="http://www.mexicoenlinea.gob.mx/">Mexico en Linea station</a> are CC-licensed. The Mexican government's project on <a href="http://www.softwarelibre.gob.mx/">open source software</a> is also promoting the CC Mexican team by reciprocal linking. This is a tremendous effort given the CC Mexico project was only started earlier this year. Stayed tuned for announcements of more freedoms & openness in Mexico.</p>
