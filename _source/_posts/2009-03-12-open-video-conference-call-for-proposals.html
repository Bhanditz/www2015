<p><a href="http://www.openvideoconference.org">The Open Video Conference</a> taking place on June 19th and 20th in NYC has published its call for proposals:</p>
<blockquote><p>The conference is a co-production of the Yale Law School Information Society Project, the Participatory Culture Foundation, Kaltura, and iCommons. The conference will feature talks from internet luminaries, panels and discussions, screenings of video art, and demonstrations of the newest internet video technology. We expect more than 400 participants. Here are some goals for the gathering:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bring together stakeholders in the online video space (video makers, coders, lawyers, academics, entrepreneurs, etc.) for cross-pollination and development of the Open Video movement.</li>
<li>Raise public interest and awareness around the Principles for an Open Video Ecosystem, a community effort to define best practices in online video.</li>
<li>Raise the public profile of video creators and artists working in the online space.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
