But now that I've gotten your attention with that spammish subject line, you might want to check out John Henshaw's <a href="http://www.familyresource.com/lifestyles/7/465/">tips for avoiding spam</a> at <a href="http://familyresource.com">Family Resource</a>, licensed under a Creative Commons license -- which means you can copy and send them to everyone in your address book.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://commoncontent.org">Common Content</a>'s snazzy RSS feed for this.</p>
