<p>I'm in Scottsdale, Arizona today and tomorrow for the <a href="http://openstandardsalliance.org">Open Source, Open Standards</a> conference. Unfortunately I couldn't make <a href="http://openstandardsalliance.org/speakers.html#b">Larry Rosen</a>'s talk this morning, but I hope to catch <a href="http://openstandardsalliance.org/speakers.html#c">Bruce Perens</a>'s this afternoon. I'm speaking tomorrow, but as with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4394">Foo Camp</a>, this is the sort of crowd and event where I do a lot more listening than talking.</p>
