<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7448">Continuing</a> our series highlighting the excellent work being done by Creative Commons international jurisdiction projects, today we present Creative Commons Italy.</p>
<p>Since the launch  of version 2.0 of  the Creative Commons Licenses at the end of 2004, the Creative  Commons Italia Working Group, based at the Politecnico of  Torino  and composed  of people from  a number of different  backgrounds  -   computer    engineers,  lawyers,   social scientists - has been  disseminating information on CC both  on-line, through   the  <a href="http://www.creativecommons.it/">CC Italy website</a> (up  to 600.000 hits/month), and  off-line, by   organizing two  national conferences (Torino, 2005 and  2006) and speaking  at  many events, in  Italy and abroad,      including       the    <a href="http://www.shareconference.org/">Shareconference    on  E-Learning</a>,  the   <a href="http://www.ictlawconference.it/">ICT     Law  International Conference</a>, the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.it/node/392">Home Made  Festival</a> and the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.it/node/389">Milano Film Festival</a>.</p>
<p> Creative Commons Italia members  have been involved,  either formally or informally, in many projects aimed  at making creative content and culture more easily shareable.</p>
<p> Among these projects  - some still ongoing  - it  is worth mentioning that La Stampa,  one of the largest  national Italian newspapers, has opened   the archives of   its  prestigious supplements - TuttoLibri, TuttoScienze, TuttoSoldi  -  and put  the  content  under a  Creative Commons license:   <a href="http://www.creativecommons.it/node/498">1</a>, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.it/node/384">2</a>,   <a href="http://www.creativecommons.it/node/380">3</a>.</p>
<p> Last, not least,  the fact that  Creative Commons Italia is hosted by the Politecnico di Torino means that the  interaction between law and technology  is not only a    theoretical concept; the Internet  Media Group of    the  Department of  Automatic   and Computer Engineering, co-directed by Juan Carlos De Martin (who  is also the Italian public lead of  Creative Commons) has developed  and is  still working on on the  first <a href="http://streaming.polito.it/">server for streaming  audio/video content</a>  on the Internet that is able to  understand   Creative Commons metadata  and  clearly inform the user on the freedoms that s/he can enjoy when listening to a web radio or looking at a video-on-demand movie.</p>
<p> Finally,  Juan  Carlos De  Martin  and  Marco Ricolfi  have  recently founded at the Politecnico di Torino the <a href="http://nexa.polito.it">NEXA Center for Internet and Society</a>,  the  first  Italian   academic think-tank  for  the   advancement of   technological,  juridical and economic understanding of the Internet.</p>
