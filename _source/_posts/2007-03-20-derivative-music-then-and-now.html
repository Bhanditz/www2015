<p>Blogger Jim Lippard has put together an interesting mini-essay on <a href="http://lippard.blogspot.com/2007/03/derivative-musical-works-and-copyright.html">derivative musical works and copyright</a> spanning copying among classic rock groups in the 1970s, a 1983 science fiction story about perpetual copyright extension, and recent sampling madness.</p>
<p>Read it for a reminder of the need for more reasonable copyright (hence CC) or to pick up some interesting trivia if you don't need that reminder.</p>
