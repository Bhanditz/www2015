<p>The response to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7819">release</a> of our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin">OpenOffice.org Addin</a> last week was great.  We had several bug reports, and lots of constructive feedback.  I've just released an update, version 0.6.1 (<a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/ccooo/ccooo-0.6.1.oxt">download</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin/Changes#0.6.1">changes</a>).   This version fixes a couple of bugs which caused OpenOffice.org to crash, as well as storing the license metadata in a more logical place within the document.  See the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin">wiki page</a> for details on how to upgrade automatically from within OpenOffice.org.</p>
