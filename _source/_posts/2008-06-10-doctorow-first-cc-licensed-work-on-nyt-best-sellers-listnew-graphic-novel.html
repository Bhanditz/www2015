<p>Hyper awesome super CC-evangelist <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> has had two great bits of news pop up in the past couple days, with the first being that his new novel, <em><a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/">Little Brother</a></em> (CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA</a>) has entered its <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/04/little-brother-goes.html">4th week on the New York Times Bestseller List</a>! A huge accomplishment in its own right, we are especially excited as this is the first case of a CC-licensed novel entering the list, let alone staying there for 4 weeks. Per usual, you can <a href="http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/">download the novel here in PDF form</a>.</p>
<p>In other Doctorow/CC news, <em><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/09/my-new-graphic-novel.html">Cory Doctorow's Futuristic Tales of the Here and Now</a></em>, "a six-edition series of comics adapted from [his] short stories by an incredibly talented crew of writers, artists, inkers and letterers" was recentlly released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA license</a>, meaning you can mix it up as you see fit (<a href="http://www.archive.org/details/CoryDoctorowsFuturisticTalesOfTheHereAndNow">get the PDF here</a>) provided it is on a noncommercial basis. Congrats to Cory on both accomplishments!</p>
