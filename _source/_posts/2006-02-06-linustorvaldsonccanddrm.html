<p>Noted <a href="http://www.silicon.com/research/specialreports/opensource/0,3800004943,39156200,00.htm">many</a> <a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/trends/06/02/02/1636216.shtml">places</a>, Linux creator Linux Torvalds has <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/1/377">written on using CC to marginalize DRM</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creative Commons licenses already require that you can't<br />
use technological measures to restrict the rigts you give with the CC<br />
licenses. The "Share Alike" license in particular requires all work based<br />
on it to also be shared alike, ie it has the "GPL feel" to it.</p>
<p><strong>If enough interesting content is licensed that way, DRM eventually becomes<br />
marginalized.</strong> Yes, it takes decades, but that's really no different at all<br />
from how the GPL works. The GPL has taken decades, and it hasn't<br />
"marginalized" commercial proprietary software yet, but it's gotten to the<br />
point where fewer people at least <em>worry</em> about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added. This is embedded in a debate about a future version of the GPL, the dominant free software license. Regardless of how you feel about this debate (or know of its existence), your mission is clear: create and discover great CC-licensed content.</p>
