<p>Among the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3856">many cool features of our re-design</a> this fall, we may not have given one page the attention it deserved.</p>
<p>If you're marking your work or web page with our little Some Rights Reserved button, you should take a look at our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/web">suggestions for making a precise statement about what's being licensed</a>, complete with examples and screenshots. We'll make the page more prominent soon.</p>
