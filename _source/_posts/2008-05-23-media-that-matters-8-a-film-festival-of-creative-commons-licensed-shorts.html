<p>Hi, my name is Fred Benenson and I'm Creative Commons' Cultural Program Associate working in New York City. I'll be blogging about and working on all things CC in the Big Apple. Without further ado, I'm happy to announce that the <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/news/2008/05/may_28_-_june_6_eighth_annual.php">eighth annual Media that Matters Film Festival</a> is about to begin in downtown Manhattan. The festival showcases shorts created by young filmmakers and releases them after the festival under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives license. <a title="Arts Engine" href="http://www.artsengine.net">Arts Engine</a>, the non-profit that organizes and hosts the festival also <a href="http://www.artsengine.net/store#film_fest_dvd">sells region-free unencrypted CC licensed DVDs</a> of all the films that can be shown in any non-commercial setting.</p>
<p>A description of the festival from <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/about/">The Media That Matters</a> site:</p>
<blockquote><p>From gay rights to global warming, the jury-selected collection represents the work of a diverse group of independent filmmakers, many of whom are under 21. The films are equally diverse in style and content, with documentaries, music videos, animations, experimental work and everything else in between. What all the films have in common is that they spark debate and action in 12 minutes or less.</p></blockquote>
