<p>Free Culture X, a conference of <a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>, will be held February 13th at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Keynote addresses will be given by Harvard Berkman Center co-founder Jonathan Zittrain, the co-founder of the public interest group Public Knowledge, Gigi Sohn, and the director of American University's Center for Social Media, Pat Aufderheide.</p>
<p>The conference is focused on developing greater openness among institutions of higher education by specifically investigating:</p>
<ul>
<li>The politics of open networks,</li>
<li>Global access to knowledge, and</li>
<li>Open education.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendees have the option to pay-what-you-want with prizes (such as signed copies of books by Lawrence Lessig and Henry Jenkins or custom voicemail recordings by Jonathan Zittrain) awarded for sizable donations. You can register at <a href="http://conference.freeculture.org/register/" target="_blank">http://conference.freeculture.org/register/</a>. CC will be in attendance in addition to many past and current CC supporters.</p>
