<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil">Bassel Khartabil</a> is a Syrian-Palestinian computer engineer who, through his innovations in social media, digital education, and open-source web software, played a huge role in opening the internet in Syria and bringing online access and knowledge to the Syrian people. <a href="/tag/freebassel">Many people reading this blog know Bassel</a> through his work as lead for CC Syria. He was arrested in March of 2012 in Damascus, and has been detained ever since.</p>
<p>The second <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/8292-pledge-for-freebasselday-2014">#FreeBassel Day</a> will be held globally on March 15, marking the second anniversary of his imprisonment and the third anniversary of the beginning of the Syrian uprising.</p>
<p>If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area, come join the SF open community on #FreeBassel Day SF at the Wikimedia Foundation offices in downtown San Francisco. In addition to sharing art, music, food, and stories about Bassel, we will be hosting a Wikipedia Edit-a-thon in honor of him. Bassel is a Wikipedian himself, so we'll be working on writing and improving articles on topics that he cares about (and might be editing now if he werenâ€™t in prison). Such topics include: Syria, computers, technology in the MENA region, open source web development, and peace (to name a few). Learn more about Bassel in his own words and the words of friends <a href="http://freebassel.org/campaign/">here</a> and <a href="http://lettersforbassel.tumblr.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>No Wikipedia editing experience is necessary - just bring your laptop, and seasoned Wikipedians will be there to provide guidance in copy-editing, article creation, and sourcing. And friends and colleagues of Bassel will be there to tell you more about him and his work.</p>
<p>We'll have an informal potluck, including food and beverages sourced from the <a href="/weblog/entry/42214">#FreeBassel Cookbook V.1</a>, a collection of recipes from friends and supporters of Bassel, collected by <a href="http://www.thebigconversationspace.org/">The Big Conversation Space</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://aerbook.com/site/">Aerbook</a>. Please bring something to share.</p>
<p>We'll also be sharing art and media created by #FreeBassel supporters, including <a href="http://disquiet.com/2014/01/23/disquiet0108-freebassel/">Disquiet Junto #FreeBassel</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfCDM6-DanbOElTDjwGtLHw">Letters for Bassel</a>.</p>
