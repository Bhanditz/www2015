<p>Since our previous CTO, <a href="http://yergler.net/blog/2011/04/08/learning-from-the-web-for-learning-on-the-web/">Nathan Yergler</a>, left CC to return to full-time engineering in April, we have been preparing to recruit his replacement. The time is now! See the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#cto">full job posting on our opportunities page</a>.</p>
<p>This is a fun job (I was Nathan's predecessor, from 2003-2007) that offers technical, management, and communications challenges and opportunities for growth and impact. Using technology to enhance (rather than <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27312">suppress</a>) sharing has always been an important part of the CC story. Some background for the truly interested candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li>All software developed by CC is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>; see our <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org">source repositories</a> and <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues">bug tracker</a>;</li>
<li>We have a small (two software engineers, one system administrator) technology team focused on maintaining and improving CC's services (implemented using Python, CiviCRM, WordPress, MediaWiki, and other technologies); additionally technology suffuses all of our work, including when policy-oriented -- the technology team and especially CTO are frequently called on to provide leadership on broad issues;</li>
<li>See our <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org">CC Labs blog</a> for occasional posts on the details of our technical work and thoughts on related happenings;</li>
<li>Watch recordings of past <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/TechSummit">CC technology summits</a>;</li>
<li>Read about the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_REL">CC Rights Expression  Language</a>, a set of recommendations implemented across CC's services and by many publishers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relative to when Creative Commons started with a vision of leveraging the Internet to scale sharing (and vice versa), there are an <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28041">unimaginable number of freely licensed works</a> to build upon, and to build services around, and 90% of the technical groundwork is laid (of course as an engineer you recognize that means 90% of the technical groundwork remains to be developed -- and that's just the beginning!). Now is an incredibly exciting time to lead the technology efforts of Creative Commons -- be part of a great team, help communities yearning to share better and more effectively (e.g., see our new <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LRMI">Learning Resources Metadata Initiative</a>), and engage with developers around the world to help build a better future.</p>
<p>We're accepting resumes through August 1. Again see the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#cto">job posting</a> for details.</p>
