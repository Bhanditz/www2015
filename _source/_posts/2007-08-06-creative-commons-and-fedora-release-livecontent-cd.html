<p>We are incredibly pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/project/livecontent">LiveContent</a>, a collaborative initiative to showcase Creative Commons-licensed media as well as free, open source software. LiveContent is a joint effort between Creative Commons and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, Red Hat's community-based open source platform.</p>
<p>The LiveContent CD features a variety of Creative Commons-licensed media including audio, video, image, text and educational resources. Users can explore this free and open content and learn more about CC-friendly orginizations like <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo</a>, <a href="http://blip.tv/">Blip.tv</a>, and <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. Fedora 7 and open source applications (such as <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a>, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp,</a> <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>) boot directly from the CD, allowing users the ability to view and remix content in various ways.</p>
<p>LiveContent is designed to be a window into the CC community by offering open content and encouraging the use of open source tools. As such, it is very much a community project, and input is necessary, be it as a developer, a content curator, or LiveContent user. This input can range from interface design to potential avenues for future distribution.</p>
<p>If you are interested in checking out the LiveContent CD, visit the Creative Commons/Fedora booth at LinuxWorld. We are also turning this week's <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC Salon</a> into a bit of a kick-off party for LiveContent with CDs available and computers running LiveContent present.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.worldlabel.com/">Worldlabel.com</a> for providing support for the development and distribution for the LiveContent CD.</p>
