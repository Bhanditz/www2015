We were impressed to see the <a href="http://www.charleston.net/stories/100603/bus_06software.shtml">Charleston Post and Courier story</a> on the basics of copyright and illegal downloading mention quite clearly Creative Commons and how it works. We were equally impressed by the long-running newsletter TidBITS and <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=07385">their recent decision</a> to release their publication under a license. They describe the process in which they arrived at the license choice &mdash; that they basically allowed the same use a license covered, realized the importance of the licenses, and decided to apply it to solidify their policies.</p>
