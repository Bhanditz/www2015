<p><img style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" title="cinepata" src="img/cinepata.jpg" alt="cinepata" width="83" height="83" /><a href="http://cinepata.com/">CinÃ©pata</a> is an online film initiative from Chilean writer and filmmaker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Fuguet">Alberto Fuguet</a> that aims to expose South American film to a broader audience. To do so, Fuget collaborated with <a href="http://creativecommons.cl/">CC Chile</a> on licensing all the films hosted therein under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/cl/">Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works</a> license, enabling them to be legally shared across the web. Fuget had this to say on the motivation behind CinÃ©pata:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œThis time, we decided [to do a] free release [of] â€œSe Arriendaâ€ because we have the distribution rights and I am the author, I think it is the moment to take advantage from Internet, so more people could watch the film. Diego Valenzuela, my producer, who also is a lawyer, is in full agreement. â€œSe Arriendaâ€ had a life in the offline world, it was successful in the movie theaters, but it was years ago and it could not be shown beyond the frontiers. Now, it is time to be digital, it could arrive to many countries and enter in thousands of screens.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>CinÃ©pata has curated an amazing initial selection of films that range in release date, genre, and country of origin. Highlights include <em><a href="http://cinepata.com/videos.php?id=41">Unos pocos buenos amigos</a></em> (1986) by Luis Ospina (Colombia), <em><a href="http://cinepata.com/videos.php?id=37">Lo que soÃ±Ã³ SebastiÃ¡n</a></em> (2004) by Rodrigo Rey Rosa (Guatemala), <em><a href="http://cinepata.com/videos.php?id=36">Como un aviÃ³n estrellado</a></em> (2005) by Ezequiel AcuÃ±a (Argentina), and <em><a href="http://cinepata.com/videos.php?id=43">Se Arrienda</a></em> (2005).
