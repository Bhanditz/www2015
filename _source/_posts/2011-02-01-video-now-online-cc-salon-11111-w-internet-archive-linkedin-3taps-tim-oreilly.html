<p>What does it mean to be open in a data-driven world?</p>
<p>On January 11, 2011, we gathered together four knowledgeable individuals who interact with data in different ways and who each understand the importance of exploring this timely question.

<p>You can now watch the video from the event, which included brief presentations from Internet Archive's Peter Brantley, LinkedIn's DJ Patil, and 3taps' Karen Gifford, as well as a panel discussion moderated by O'Reilly Media's Tim O'Reilly. <a href="http://blip.tv/file/4707025"> View it now</a>!</p>
