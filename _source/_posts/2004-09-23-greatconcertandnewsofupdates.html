If you attended or heard the webcast of the Creative Commons Benefit Concert that was presented by WIRED last night, I'm sure you'll agree it was a fantastic show. Gilberto Gil and David Byrne played for almost two hours each, and even sang a couple songs together. We want to thank everyone that came out and everyone that helped setup the show.</p>
<p>
We've updated <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">the WIRED page</a> with new information, featuring a short snippet from <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/reticulum_rex/">our second movie</a> explaining <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/sampling">the Sampling licenses</a>. We've also created <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/sampling">a one-page comic</a> explaining how the license works in practice.</p>
<p>
In other news, we've also launched <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">a new way to support the work of our non-profit</a>. Our support page carries several ways to give to the organization: you can become a Commoner and obtain varying levels of merchandise for your donation, you can donate directly, and you can buy t-shirts from us or cafepress.</p>
