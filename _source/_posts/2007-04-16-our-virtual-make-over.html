<p>For those who havenâ€™t already noticed, Creative Commonsâ€™ home on <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Kula%204/46/92/26/">Kula 4 </a> in Second Life is currently undergoing a complete make over - which is happening alongside our Real life office move!  Thanks to the ideas of <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~markp/ ">Professor Mark Perry</a> (Learned Om) and <a href="http://nic.suzor.com/">Nic Suzor </a> (Nic Marx) of CC Australia, and the work of our in-world friends, we are expecting to hold the Grand opening of the new CC HQ in June 2007.  The design plans include a CC marketplace, school, sandbox, and new home for FreeCulture.org.  Check it out for yourself! </p>

<p>Our SL design and build experts are Bibi Book, <a href="http://boomslang.wordpress.com/">Barney Boomslang</a>, and Kimba McMillan.  Bibi and Barney are the same duo who brought us the avatar sized <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/bboomslang/SecondLifeSnapshots/photo#4985701298866290706">CC licensed chess set</a>, and resulting <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/avatar-chess/">monthly games</a>.  Kimba is Bibi's apprentice. He has helped to organize events, assisted in making the new layout, and is working on learning more about building and terraforming.  Barney Boomslang is a scripter and builder of mostly avatars and simscapes.  He hosts the CC radio stream for our listening enjoyment at Kula.  Bibi Book is a builder as well, who does some scripting.  She wrote a Hitchiker's Guide to SL.  She also teaches on demand, helps newcomers learn the ropes, and supports live music at her beach cafe.  Find them at <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Yongnam/221/48/24">Lummerland</a> or roaming around the virtualscape.</p>

<p>So far, we also have a few graduate students contributing to this project as well.  You can find them in-world as Raja Om, Imran Om, and Cowzog Delcon.  Cowzog, aka <a href="http://www.fredbenenson.com/more.php">Fred Benenson</a>, built the intense spherical theater being temporarily displayed at Kula.  (The 360 degree video images shown in it are recorded with this <a href="http://www.ptgrey.com/products/ladybug2/index.asp">special camera</a>.)</p>
<p>If anyone else would like to share their talents in building, landscaping, or stocking the Marketplace, please contact any team members mentioned above (Iâ€™m Genevieve Junot in SL).  Join us for weekly meetings on Fridays at 3pm SLT / 23:00 GMT on <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Kula%204/46/92/26/">Kula Island</a>.  Find our planning notes on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Marketplace">wiki</a>.<br />
