<p>With the introduction at the federal level of both the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36699">Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR)</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35267">White House public access directive</a>, several states have begun to think about supporting public access to publicly funded research. Like the proposed federal legislation and White House policy, the state-level bills aim to support the notion that the taxpaying public should have access to the research it funds. The Illinois legislation is particularly interesting in that it has included a reuse rights provision whereby the articles developed as a result of state funds would be shared under an open license such as CC BY. </p>
<h3><a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB609">California</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Notwithstanding any other law, each state agency that provides funding in the form of a research grant to a grantee for direct research shall develop a public access policy that shall do the following:
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(1) Include a requirement that electronic versions of the authorâ€™s final manuscripts, or a link to an electronic version of the authorâ€™s final manuscript in an open access digital repository of original research papers that have been accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and result from research supported from state agency funding, be submitted to the funding state agency and the California State Library.
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(2) Provide free online public access to such final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after publication in peer-reviewed journals. [...]
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>(a) No later than 12 months after the effective date of this Act, each public institution of higher education shall develop an open access to research articles policy.

</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(1) the submission, by all faculty employed by the public institution of higher education, to the employing institution (or to an institution designated by the employing institution) of an electronic version of the author's final manuscript of original research papers upon acceptance by a scholarly research journal, including peer-reviewed journals and related publications used by researchers to disseminate the results of their institution-affiliated research; [...]
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(4) free online public access to the final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions immediately upon publication in a peer-reviewed journal;
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(5) an irrevocable, worldwide copyright license granted by the author to the public that permits any use of an article on condition that the author and original publisher are attributed as such and that any such attribution is not made in a way that implies endorsement of the use by the author or original publisher.
