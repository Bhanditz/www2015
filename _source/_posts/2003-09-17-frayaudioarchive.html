<p>This week we're highlighting <a href="http://powazek.com/">Derek Powazek</a>'s online storytelling work at <a href="http://fray.com/">The Fray</a>, specifically <a href="http://fray.com/events/audio/">The Fray Audio Archive</a>. The Fray is a site where people tell stories and others comment on those stories, and once a year there are worldwide gatherings to do open-mic storytelling live, dubbed <a href="http://frayday.com/">Fray Day</a>. The <a href="http://fray.com/events/audio/">Fray Audio Archive</a> contains recordings from the past 5 years of events, totalling over 18 <em>hours</em> of Creative Commons licensed audio. If you like what you hear, you might want to check out <a href="http://frayday.com/">this year's Fray Day</a>, taking place between October 3rd and 5th in 14 cities across the globe.</p>
<p>
Also worth noting is that all Fray audio is being generously hosted by the <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, free of charge. We've recently updated the licensing process to point out the Archive's <a href="http://archive.org/audio/collection.php?collection=opensource_audio">Open Source Audio</a> and <a href="http://archive.org/movies/opensource_movies.php">Open Source Movies</a> areas. The Archive offers free hosting of audio and video works you have created and licensed under Creative Commons, so if storage and bandwidth are holding your creativity back, do yourself a favor and check out the <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>.</p>
