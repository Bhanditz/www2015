<p>As recently <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/5482">announced</a>, Creative Commons unveiled its present to the Free Culture Movementâ€”a recording of "Happy Birthday To You" sung by, some might say, the 'leaders of the free world'â€”being some of the leaders in the free culture, free software and open source software movements.
<p>The song is now available for <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/happybirthday/">download</a> and donations are welcome to help cover the licensing fees and to assist the Free Culture Movement.</p>
<p>Ever wondered what The Staff of EFF, Mitch Kapor, Dan Gillmor, Brian Behlendorf, Ian Clarke, Jimmy Wales, Brewster Kahle, and Gigi Sohn sound like when singing? Download now to find out. (And don't forget to make a donation to help the Free Culture Movement on their way!)</p>
