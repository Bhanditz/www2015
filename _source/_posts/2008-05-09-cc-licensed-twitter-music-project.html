<p>The <em><a href="http://kujira-ongaku.net/twitter-cd/">Twitter Compilation Album</a></em> is the end result of 34 different people meeting over Twitter and coming together to produce a CC-licensed album of unique and interesting music, all without meeting en masse in the same physical space. Most of those involved made music while others created pictures and provided server hosting. The end product has been released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.1/jp/">BY-NC-SA</a> license and is absolute cat nip for those who are interested in online collaboration through new media tools.</p>
