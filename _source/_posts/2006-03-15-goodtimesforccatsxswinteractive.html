<p>
A few of us have just returned from Austin, Texas, where we attended <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/?PHPSESSID=ec9e4608600a53129bad807ceb7b85db">SXSW Interactive</a>. I'd like to share a few personal highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saturday's <a href="http://www.laptopbattle.org/">laptop battle</a>, hosted by <a href="http://www.amoda.org/">AMODA</a>. Competitive live electronic musicmaking as it was meant to be: loud, manic, and super geeky.
</li>
<li>Manning the CC booth on the trade show floor with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#21">Mike Linksvayer</a>. We met hundreds of interesting people and had many, many great conversations about CC, intellectual property, and media. We were lucky to be set up right by our friends from <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> -- it was nice being able to point to our next-booth neighbors as an example of a successful commons-based business model (as well as an excellent source of CC-licensed music). Creative Commons stickers and pins were so popular that we had to request emergency backup supplies (thanks, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#49">Jen</a>!).
</li>
<li>The Monday morning panel I was on, called "Remixing Business for a Convergent World." The turnout was terrific -- the room was packed with about 125 people. Several introduced themselves to me after the presentation to ask questions and give feedback about CC.
</li>
<li>Monday night's Fifth Annual EFF/Creative Commons SXSW party. This is where I saw the coolest group of musicians of all time: The Robo Theremin Band, which is a project of Austin's <a href="http://www.robotgroup.org/">Robot Group</a>. Their show is made up of guys playing electric drums, a synth, and a theremin, accompanied by remote-controlled giant robots on wheels, moving around on a dance floor. Incredible!
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, SXSW rocked. I'm already looking forward to next year!</p>
