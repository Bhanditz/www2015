<p>If you didn't read your morning New York Times and see a tall fellow wearing a CC logo shirt, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/technology/09data.html?ref=technology">check out this article</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Hillis">Danny Hillis</a> and Robert Cook's new venture, <a href="http://metaweb.com">Metaweb's</a> <a href="http://freebase.com/">Freebase project</a>, which is using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249">newly released CC Attribution (BY) 3.0 license</a> across-the-board (data and User Generated Content). It is great to see this license adoption as the web is <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/freebase_will_p_1.html">aflame today with talk about a missing piece of web 2.0's healthy ecosystem</a>, a free database. Metaweb is linking to massive content on the web, drawing relationships between this information, and including us all in the loop to help round out the connections and make comments.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://freebase.com">Freebase's website</a> they state this about usage of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY 3.0</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Really free. We want to make it possible for you to add high quality structured information to your websites, mashups and applications without worrying about restrictive corporate licenses. All data is licensed Creative Commons Attribution. We only ask that you link back to us.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in using a similar liberal <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> License, make sure to<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7262"> stop by and see us at SXSW in Austin tomorrow through next Saturday</a>. And, don't forget to come to our <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/fieldwork/sxsw_good_party1">fundraiser this Monday night in Austin in coordination with the magazine GOOD</a>.</p>
