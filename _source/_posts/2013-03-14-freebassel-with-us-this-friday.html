<p>This Friday, 15 March, is the one-year anniversary of the detainment of CC Syria lead Bassel Khartibil by the Syrian government. It's also the second anniversary of the start of the conflict in Syria. </p>
<p>Bassel is a software engineer who has been an important open web advocate and a big part of the CC community for many years. For the past year, CC has been supporting the <a href="http://freebassel.org/">FREEBASSEL project</a>, which aims to draw attention to his detainment and ultimately secure Bassel's release.</p>
<p>This Friday, FREEBASSEL is planning a day of global solidarity, inviting everyone to host events, demonstrations, and parties in honor of Bassel. You can do anything - make posters, release software, translate his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil">Wikipedia entry</a>, throw a party at a local bar. Have a cheers for #FREEBASSEL and tweet the picture of your group in your local language. It's a day to remember Bassel and spread the word. </p>
<p>You can find out about events already being organised for Free Bassel Day, or post about your own, at <a href="http://freebasselday.org/">freebasselday.org</a>. Some of the great events already being organised by the CC community include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CC France and OKFN are organising a Syrian dinner in Paris;</li>
<li>CC Netherlands and Kennisland have created a poster with information and are placing it behind metal bars throughout Amsterdam, to mimic Bassel's incarceration;</li>
<li>CC HQ is teaming with Wikimedia and EFF to hold a FreeBassel event in San Francisco, with activities and a FREEBASSEL photo shoot.</li>
</ul>
