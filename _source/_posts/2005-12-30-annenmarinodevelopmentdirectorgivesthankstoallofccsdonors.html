<p>We launched the 2005 fundraising campaign in October and have received an outpouring of gifts from so many dedicated people who also believe what we at CC believe: that supporting free culture in all its forms is paramount.  Your donations are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Because of this tremendous community support, the groundwork for CCâ€™s fundraising program is in place.  2006 will bring many more opportunities for CC to serve the public, create programs for individual Commoners to connect and participate, provide networking forums and events for CCâ€™s new Corporate Commoners Program and encourage and involve continuing institutional support.  Stay tuned!  2006 will have many surprises!</p>
<p>Thanks again for each and every gift to CC (and please keep them coming so we can make our goal!). Weâ€™re looking forward to providing the community with more services, opportunities and fun events that will keep this movement growing.</p>
