<p><strong>Creative Commons Japan + Appliya Studio + DubLab + Creative Commons + corde Japan, US, and worldwide â€” November 12th, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Today, Creative Commons Japan and iPhone developer Appliya Studio announced the release of a brand new iPhone application, "AudioVisual Mixer for Into Infinity", specially developed for the launch of the <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/">Into Infinity</a> project in Japan. Into Infinity is a collaboration between Creative Commons and non-profit web radio collective Dublab.</p>
<p>Into Infinity comprises a collection of ready-to-remix 12-inch circular artworks and 8-second music loops created by a vast array of artists from around the world. Contributors include world-renowned graffiti artist Kofie, 2008 Whitney Biennial alumni Lucky Dragons, Anticon collective member Odd Nosdam, and electronic musicians Flying Lotus and DNTEL (AKA Jimmy Tamborello of The Postal Service). For its expansion to Japan, the Into Infinity project has additionally collected 50 "EAR" sound loops and 50 "EYE" visual circles from Japanese sound and visual artists (list below).</p>
<p>Creative Commons Japan teamed with APPLIYA on "AudioVisual Mixer for Into Infinity" to celebrate the growth of this free audio visual culture and to promote a more intuitive, open, and unique remix experience around Into Infinity's Japan launch. The application was developed by Kensuke Sembo from internationally acclaimed media art duo Exonemo and Ages5&Up, an art and design collective known for witty yet solid interaction design.</p>
<p>When opened, the application connects to a server where all the project's resources are stored, automatically downloading sound loops ("EAR") that are paired with visual circles ("EYE"). The Into Infinity logo serves as an anchor point to trigger sounds: circles are moved by dragging them with your finger and when brought into the logo's orbit the sounds start mixing. Here, the act of remixing is enabled by a simple touch interaction with the iPhone screen, allowing literally anyone to enjoy mixing or simply listen to the soundscape.</p>
<p>Users can share their mix instantly by posting to Twitter or by emailing their friends.  An URL pointing to the mix generated is attached to the message so others can reenact your experience.  You can also set the mix as your iPhone's ring tone after downloading the mix to your home computer.</p>
<p>All mixes generated by the application's users are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license, keeping in line with the project as a whole.<br />
