<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts, USAâ€”June 24, 2005</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible<br />
 copyright licenses for authors and artists, is holding a conference<br />
 at Harvard Law School over the coming weekend of June 25 and 26,<br />
 2005, for all of its international collaboration partners, who are<br />
 responsible for the legal â€˜portingâ€™ of the Creative Commons<br />
 licenses and building community around the licenses.</p>
<p>Representatives from 37 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia,<br />
 Australia, Europe, and the Middle East will be coming together to<br />
 discuss a wide range of topics, including the experience of the<br />
 Creative Commonsâ€™ collaboration partners in â€˜portingâ€™ the Creative<br />
 Commons licenses in their local jurisdiction and their experience<br />
 in terms of the local adoption of the Creative Commons licenses. In<br />
 addition, the conference will serve as a forum to discuss global<br />
 issues faced by Creative Commons and its collaboration partners<br />
 including moral rights and collecting societies.</p>
<p>Creative Commons began its internationalization project in 2003. To<br />
 date, Creative Commons licenses are available in 20 different<br />
 jurisdictions with another 11 jurisdictions actively in the process<br />
 of â€˜porting.â€™ Porting involves translating the licenses<br />
 linguistically as well as legally so that the licenses are<br />
 customized for the requirements of the specific jurisdiction. In<br />
 total, Creative Commons is in talks with representatives from 70<br />
 different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Christiane Asschenfeldt, Executive Director of iCommons, Creative<br />
 Commonsâ€™ legal porting project, said: â€œAfter two years of online<br />
 collaboration it will be great for all of us to eventually meet in<br />
 person to discuss the issues facing Creative Commons and our<br />
 experiences in implementing the licenses.â€</p>
<p>Executive Director of Creative Commonsâ€™ international community<br />
 building project, Paula Le Dieu said: â€œThis event marks the start<br />
 of Creative Commons as a truly international organization as it<br />
 gathers together for the first time the incredible group of people<br />
 that have been responsible for the growth and success of Creative<br />
 Commons as a global phenomenon.â€œ</p>
