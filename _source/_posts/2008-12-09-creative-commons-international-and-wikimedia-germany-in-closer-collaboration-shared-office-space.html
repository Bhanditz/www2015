<p><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong></p>
<p>Building on existing collaborations with local Wikimedia projects, Creative Commons International (CCi) will be moving its current office in Berlin-Mitte to Berlin-SchÃ¶neberg to share workspace with Wikimedia Germany. The move reflects the organizationsâ€™ growing efforts and long-standing mutual support.</p>
<p>Wikimedia Germany, the first independent national Wikimedia chapter, is known the world over for its high quality articles and exemplary member participation, leading the first international Wikimedia conference â€œWikimaniaâ€ in 2005 in Frankfurt am Main and establishing Wikipedia Academies in 2006.</p>
<p>â€œThe free culture and free content communities in Germany are incredibly strong, and this collaboration will help build bridges across projects, people, and resources. It is my hope that these ties will extend to community members worldwide.â€ CCi Director Dr. Catharina Maracke remarks.</p>
<p>CCi works closely with other local Wikimedia chapters, including Wikimedia Serbia, one of the institutional hosts of the CC Serbia project, and Wikimedia Indonesia, which will shortly begin porting the CC licenses to Indonesian law. Nordic CC and Wikimedia communities are also strengthening ties, as demonstrated by the recent "free society" conference FSCONS, organized by CC Sweden, Wikimedia Sweden, and the Free Software Foundation Europe.</p>
<p>Beginning December 10, 2008, the CCi office will be based in Eisenacher StraÃŸe 2, 10777 Berlin, Germany.</p>
