<p>Ambient sound artist <a href="http://www.negativesoundinstitute.com/gurdonark2.php">Gurdonark</a> writes beautifully at the (unofficial) ccMixterblog on <a href="http://ccmixterblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/virtuosos-rock-stars-and-remix-culture.html">Virtuosos, Rock Stars and Remix Culture</a>:<br />
<blockquote>We all tend to make remixes more than we tend to discuss high-flown concepts--but my simple premise is that we should never forget that we are part of a conversation about permissive licensing and its virtue in advancing the cause of music. Only one person can be a Liszt or a Rachmaninoff. But each of us in our humble way can work, through voluntary licensing, to create a "creator-safe" zone for using samples and 'pellas to share culture. Our modes may be hip-hop or electronica or rock (or ambient), but the point is the same--we advance a sharing economy, and the creative weight of history is with us, not against us.</p></blockquote>
