<p>Manu Sporny of Digital Bazaar just posted an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGg8A2zfWKg">entirely non-technical video explaining the Semantic Web</a>. The video and all of its <a href="http://wiki.digitalbazaar.com/en/Semantic-web-intro">source material</a> are available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC Attribution-ShareAlike license</a> for sharing and remixing. Quote from the video:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can open a web browser, you can understand the Semantic Web.</p></blockquote>
<p>CC has been using Semantic Web technologies for the machine-readable layer of its licenses from the beginning and we've <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7902">recently migrated much of our server-side infrastructure to these technologies</a>.</p>
