<p>
Creative Commons, <a href="http://www.kalw.org/">KALW</a>, and <a href="http://www.soundopinions.org/">Chicago Public Radioâ€™s Sound Opinions</a> are pleased to present Chicago Tribune music critic and author <a href="http://www.gregkot.com/">Greg Kot</a> in conversation with music journalist <a href="http://www.davidrdowns.com/">David Downs</a>. Kot's new book, <a href="http://www.gregkot.com/ripped.html">Ripped: How the Wired Generation Revolutionized Music</a>, explores the changing face of the music industry. Downs and Kot will discuss the book, as well as how digital sharing and participatory culture are shaping how music is created and consumed. Audience questions and discussion will follow the conversation.</p>
<p>When: Thursday, October 15, 7-9pm<br />
Where: <a href="http://parisoma.com">PariSoMa</a>, 1436 Howard St. (<a href="http://maps.google.de/maps?q=1436+howard+st+san+francisco&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=de&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&resnum=1&ct=image">map and directions</a>). Plenty of street parking available. (Please note, the space is located up two steep flights of stairs, and unfortunately does not currently have elevator access.)</p>
<p>Light refreshments will be provided, and since we rely on the generosity of our community to keep us afloat, weâ€™ll be accepting donations for CC at the door. </p>
<p>Check out the event posting on <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/3087184/">Upcoming</a> and let us know you're coming on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/creativecommons#/event.php?eid=146280936427&ref=mf">Facebook</a>. We hope to see you there!</p>
<p>If you can't make it to the salon on Thursday (or even if you can!), we're excited to also announce that the following evening, <strong>Greg will be doing a reading, talk, and book signing at <a href="http://booksmith.com/">the Booksmith</a></strong> on Haight St. in San Francisco. Come out to one of San Francisco's premier independent bookstores for a more intimate evening with Greg. Friday, October 16th, 7:30 pm.</p></p>
