<p>Great news for those in Southern California who can't make it all the way up to SF for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7855">CC's 5 Year Birthday Bash</a> - our friends at <a href="http://www.foundla.com/">Found LA</a> have decided to get together and <a href="http://www.foundla.com/sys/shows/creative-commons/">throw us a party at their amazing gallery</a> in Silverlake (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;q=1903+Hyperion+Ave.+Los+Angeles%2C+CA+90027+">Google Map here</a>), with free drinks and a cake to boot. It goes from 8PM - 10PM this Saturday (12/15) and is bound to be a blast - there are some CC shenanigans in store and it will be great opportunity to meet up with those engaged in the CC-community in the LA area.</p>
<p>More info is available <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Surprise_Birthday_Party_2007_Los_Angeles">on our wiki</a>, as are the details for the other parties <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party">happening around the world</a> in <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2007_Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2007_Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2007_Seoul">Seoul</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_and_Launch_Event_2007_Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCau_Birthday_BBQ_Bash">Brisbane</a>, Pasay City, and New York. I'll be at the LA bash and am super excited to meet people in the area who are doing interesting things with CC and/or looking to learn more about what we do. For those unable to attend in person, please feel free to celebrate CC in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> as well.</p>
<p>As Melissa <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7855">said previously</a>, no matter where you are in the world, we invite you to celebrate CCâ€™s five years of helping to keep culture free and celebrate the future of participatory culture.</p>
