<p>The Creative Commons Board of Directors is seeking recommendations from the Creative Commons community for potential candidates to serve on the board of directors and a new, to-be-formed advisory council. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to Creative Commons and advance our mission of maximizing digital creativity, sharing, and innovation.</p>
<h2>Why we are doing this</h2>
<p>Creative Commons Board of Directors is making structural adjustments and engaging in succession planning. As part of this process, during the April 2013 Creative Commons Board of Directors meeting, the board agreed to form a Creative Commons Advisory Council for which it is also seeking members. The advisory council is distinct from the board. While it will not have decision-making authority, its role is to provide depth of experience and knowledge for the board to tap.</p>
<p>This open call for board and advisory council nominations is designed to engage the entire Creative Commons community in identifying candidates who will ensure Creative Commons continues to have the resources, leadership, and oversight necessary to carry out its vision and mission, and does so in a way that is inclusive of our global community.</p>
<h2>What the Creative Commons Board of Directors is looking for</h2>
<p>The board seeks candidates who have a passion and enthusiasm for Creative Commons and can act as ambassadors, fundraisers, and experts.</p>
<p>Creative Commons has developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/creativecommons.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsIKbRz-8utNdDFaNjRqVFBRNmx2TlVtdkJZY1JXN1E#gid=0" title="CC Board Matrix of Key Skills">matrix of key skills</a> needed on the board and advisory council.
