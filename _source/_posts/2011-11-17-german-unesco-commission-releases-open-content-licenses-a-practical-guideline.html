<p>The German UNESCO Commission has released the publication, "<a href="http://unesco.de/fileadmin/medien/Dokumente/Kommunikation/DUK_opencontent_FINAL.pdf">Open Content Lizenzen â€“ Ein Leitfaden fÃ¼r die Praxis</a>" (pdf) aka "Open Content Licenses - A Practical Guideline." The publication is authored by Dr. Till Kreutzer, a member of the Commission's legal expert committee and a founder of iRights.info, a legal information website for consumers. The publication explains how to make use of open licenses, featuring the CC license suite as its primary example. Though tailored towards companies, institutions and organizations, the guideline is also a compact how-to for anyone interested in CC licensing their work. The publication is available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/de/">CC BY-NC</a>, and is a timely follow-up to UNESCO's related publication with the Commonwealth of Learning, "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30073">Guidelines for Open Educational Resources (OER) in Higher Education</a>" â€” which also highlights the use of CC licenses for OER.</p>
