<p>We're thrilled to announce a $15,000 gift from <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/">Squidoo</a>, the popular publishing platform that allows you to create and share content with the world. So why are they supporting CC? <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a>, Squidoo's Founder says: </p>
<p><em>Creative Commons is doing something incredibly difficult and valuable: they are changing expectations. Before CC, the default mode for everything was to lock it up, forever, in a way that cripples the community. With CC, the new default is to share unless there's a good reason not to. And sharing is our future.<br />
</em><br />
We couldn't agree more. Join Seth in <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/">supporting CC</a> and making sure fair sharing is our future. </p>
