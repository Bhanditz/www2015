<p>Weâ€™re happy to welcome the <a href="http://us.creativecommons.org">CC United States</a> (CC US) affiliate to the Creative Commons family. The hub for CC US will be located at the American University Washington College of Lawâ€™s <a href="https://www.wcl.american.edu/pijip/">Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property</a> in Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>CC US <a href="http://us.creativecommons.org/people">team members</a> bring considerable legal and policy expertise to the table. CC US has initial plans to focus on education and outreach on CC licensing for open educational resources at the K-12 and community college levels. This area has seen significant activity in the United States over the last several years, most notably with the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26100">Department of Laborâ€™s $2 billion grant program</a> for the creation of worker retraining materials under open licenses. In addition, CC US will help improve the understanding of limitations and exceptions to copyright, including the US-specific concept of fair use. For more information, check out the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/United_States">CC US roadmap</a>. </p>
<p>You might be asking, isnâ€™t Creative Commons already active in the United States? The answer is yes.  At the same time, thereâ€™s never been a formal CC US affiliate team like there is for the rest of the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">CC community</a>. Creative Commons was established as a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation in 2001, and the headquarters office has historically served the de facto US affiliate. During the 3.0 license development process, Creative Commons relied on a temporary relationship with the <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center for Internet & Society</a> to provide legal support for the 3.0 release, at which time the generic licenses were reworked to more adequately align with international treaties as opposed to United States copyright law. Itâ€™s become increasingly apparent over the last few years that interest in Creative Commons in the United States -- whether in the cultural, education, government, data and other sectors -- has grown beyond the organizational capacity of the headquarters staff. So, by formalizing CC US, we can empower the growth of advocates working on U.S.-centric issues around CC and copyright while simultaneously freeing up capacity for the headquarters office to focus on organization-wide activities and strategic opportunities. </p>
<p>CC US will host a <a href="http://creativecommonsus.org/launch">launch party</a> on October 17, 2013. The event will run from 6:00 â€“ 9:00 p.m. at the <a href="http://carnegiescience.edu/">Carnegie Institution for Science</a> in Washington, D.C. Welcome aboard CC US!</p>
