<p>Last October, ccLearn interviewed Frances Pinter, Publisher of Bloomsbury Academic, a (then) new imprint by Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (known for its popular Harry Potter series), that consists of releasing works for free online through a Creative Commons license and offering print-on-demand (POD) copies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Recently, a new page has popped up at Bloomsbury Academic---Richard Poynder's The Basement Interviews. The Basement Interviews are the result of Mr. Poynder's ambition to get to the bottom of the movement, namely, the free and open culture movement. From his post,</p>
<p>"<em>A few years ago I could see an increasing number of "free" and "open" movements beginning to develop. And while they all had different aims, they appeared to represent a larger and more generalised development than their movement-specific objectives might suggest.</p>
<p>Indeed, I felt that they looked set to exemplify the old adage that the sum of some phenomena is always greater than the constituent parts. But if that was right, I wondered, what was the sum in this case?</p>
<p>I was also intrigued as to why they were emerging now. For while it was apparent that these movements â€” including Open Source and Free software, Creative Commons, Free Culture, Open Access, Open Content, Public Knowledge, Open Data, Open Source Politics, Open Source Biology, and Open Source Journalism etc. â€” all owed a great debt to the development of the Internet, it was not clear to me that the network was the only driver.</p>
<p>The genesis of the Free Software Movement, for instance, could be said to lie in the specific culture of the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT in the 1970s, rather than the Internet. And at that time software programs were still generally written as part of large-scale centralised projects, and distributed on floppy disks or tapes. So I suspected that the Internet was not a sufficient explanation on its own.</p>
<p>Additionally, I was curious about the individuals who had founded these movements: What had motivated them? Why did they feel so passionate about the cause that they had adopted? What did they think the various movements had in common (if anything) with one another? What was the big picture?</p>
<p>All in all, it seemed to me to be good material for a book; a book that I envisaged would consist primarily of a series of Q&amp;A interviews with the key architects and advocates of what I had come to call the Free Knowledge movement â€” people like John Perry Barlow, John Gilmore, Michael Hart, Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Linus Torvalds, Jay Rosen, Lawrence Lessig, Joe Trippi, Harold Varmus, Vitek Tracz, Stevan Harnad, Paul Ginsparg, Cory Doctorow, Yochai Benkler, Richard Jefferson, Michel Bauwens etc.</em>"</p>
