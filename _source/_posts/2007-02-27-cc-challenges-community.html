<p><strong>CHALLENGE</strong><br />
We challenge you, our community, to raise $6000 for Creative Commons by subscribing to <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/">GOOD Magazine</a> and having a drink with us at the famed <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">South by Southwest (SXSW)</a> conference in Austin, TX. All it takes is for 200 people over the next 2 weeks to <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/choosegood/creativecommons">subscribe</a> to GOOD. No, my math skills are not wrong. If you subscribe in the next 2 weeks your $20 bucks will be generously matched by <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> for up to $2000. So you won't just raise $4000 for CC but $6000.</p>
<p><strong>DETAILS</strong><br />
Since July 2006, Creative Commons has been one of the <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/subscribe">12 non-profits</a> benefitting from the Choose GOOD campaign. GOOD magazine was started by some innovative people who have taken a non-traditional approach to promoting their magazine - and have experienced unbelievable success.  The folks at GOOD have been traveling around the nation hosting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goodmagazine/sets/">parties</a> and more importantly raising money and awareness for the non-profits that they support.</p>
<p>Over the past 7 months they have sold 11,899 subscriptions generating over $200,000 which in turn is gifted to 12 non-profits that are doing new, innovative, and great things. CC is one of them and since July GOOD has raised over $11,000 for us!</p>
<p>We need your help to make <a href="http://www.goodmagazine.com/fieldwork/sxsw_good_party1">GOOD Magazine's SXSW party</a> honoring Creative Commons the most successful party they've hosted to date. Cover charge is the $20 subscription fee and we strongly suggest emailing your rsvp to rsvp@goodmagazine.com.</p>
<p>If you want to help support CC and attend one of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goodmagazine/sets/">GOOD's infamous parties</a> but do not reside in the Austin, TX area don't worry - your subscription fee gets you into any of the upcoming GOOD parties. And yes all parties are open bar.</p>
<p>By subscribing to this awesome new magazine you gain entrance to the biggest GOOD/SXSW party to date and you're helping us raise $6000 for CC. That money will support what we continue to do best - enable a participatory culture.</p>
