<p>The <a href="http://fcx2013.org/">Students for Free Culture conference</a> will take place in New York City April 20-21. The conference--dubbed FCX 2013--will be held at New York Law School. </p>

<blockquote><p>The Students for Free Culture Conference is an annual gathering of student and non-student activists, thinkers, and innovators who are dedicated to advancing discussions on technology, law, and public policy. Through panels and keynote speakers, FCX 2013 will focus on current issues in intellectual property law, open access to educational resources, maker culture, and technology policy. Through workshops, the conference will revisit the core pillars of the free culture movement, examine the success stories from our movement, and identify new ways in which Students for Free Culture can advocate for a more free, open, and participatory digital environment.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Longtime SFC member Benjamin Mako Hill (who will be giving the opening keynote) <a href="http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/students-for-free-culture-conference-fcx2013">says</a>: "If previous years are any indication, the conference can serve as an incredible introduction to free culture, free software, wikis, remixing, copyright, patent and trademark reform, and participatory culture. For folks that are already deeply involved, FCX is among the best places I know to connect with other passionate, creative, people working on free culture issues."</p>
<p>The event is open to all, with a suggested $15 donation to help defray costs. <a href="http://fcx2013.org/fcxregistration.html">Registration is open</a>, and some <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j-C-jfuhKYmVpP0gNQMFKbKaeLP0SIsOA7Pz35XoRbY/viewform">limited travel assistance</a> may be available for students of active SFC chapters. </a></p>
