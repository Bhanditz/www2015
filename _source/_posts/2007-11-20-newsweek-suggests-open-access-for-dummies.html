<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/71360/output/print">Credit Where Credit is Due</a>, an article in Newsweek, about use of text from Wikipedia by major publishers without compliance with Wikipedia's license, includes quotes from CC CEO Lawrence Lessig on license interoperability:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Free Software Foundation, which maintains Wikipedia's GNU license, is teaming up with a popular rival licensing movement called Creative Commons to create an interoperable open source standard. "This has been my secret obsession and work for the last four years," says Lawrence Lessig, a Creative Commons founder and Stanford University law professor. "Make the legal issues totally invisible to the average user who is trying to use free culture in a way that is responsible and trustable." By making the two licenses interoperable, for example, users will be able to integrate text, photographs and music samples from Wikipedia with Creative Commons-licensed content on Flickr or jamendo. Posting, reprinting, sharing and otherwise licensing such material would simply require attribution (and not the actual clunky text of the license).</p></blockquote>
<p>The article's closes with an excellent suggestion:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's enough to suggest that, for penance, Wiley ought to commission "Open Access for Dummies." Published under a Creative Commons license, naturally.</p></blockquote>
