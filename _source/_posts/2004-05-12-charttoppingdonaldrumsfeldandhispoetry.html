<p>Proving that culture can be remixed in almost real-time, <a href="http://www.stuffedpenguin.com/">a group from San Francisco</a> has created <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=487&ncid=762&e=3&u=/ap/20040512/ap_en_ot/music_classical_rumsfeld">an album of piano and opera versions of US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's statements to the press</a>. They offer <a href="http://stuffedpenguin.com/rumsfeld/lyrics.htm">sound samples and the lyrics</a> pulled from press briefings on their site, and are <a href="http://stuffedpenguin.com/tourdates.html">currently on tour</a>. Rumsfeld himself has heard the songs and <a href="http://stuffedpenguin.com/news.html#newsflash">jokingly decried the state of music</a>, now that he is the subject of songs.
