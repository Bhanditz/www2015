<p>One of the most important values at Creative Commons is the usability of our tools. We strive to make all of our tools human-readable,<strong> </strong>often bridging dissonant vocabularies and frameworks to ensure our tools are compatible and understandable the world over. <strong>The challenge of localization is balancing legally sound terminology with culturally palatable translations. </strong>Sometimes the terms in which lawyers and courts communicate are unfamiliar or alienating to users outside of the legal profession. Moreover, even within the legal field, there can be a range of opinions about which terms are most appropriate.</p>
<p>Creative Commons oversees translation on two levels: our legal code and our license deeds. The former, the legal code or "lawyer-readable" layer, is adapted to the laws and official languages of jurisdictions around the world. The latter, the deeds or "human-readable" layer, are designed for everyone to understand. Unlike the legal code, the deeds are not legally-binding but rather a helpful, plain-language summary.</p>
<p>Historically, if two or more jurisdictions shared the same language, such as  Spanish, each jurisdiction team would conduct a translation of the legal code <em>and</em> of the deeds. Sometimes the result is messy: <strong>for Spanish alone, we  had over 10 translations of  the license deeds</strong>, some differing only  slightly and others more so.</p>
<p>Creative Commons invited its affiliates in Spanish-speaking jurisdictions to review the Spanish translations of the license names (Attribution, ShareAlike, NonCommercial, and NoDerivatives). In a conversation led by CC Chile's Claudio Ruiz, the Latin American affiliates discussed the best linguistic solution, one that balanced usability with legal accuracy. After several months of discussion, a majority of the Latin American teams reached <strong>an agreement to harmonize their existing deeds </strong>into one under the following scheme. This is particularly notable since unlike the Arab harmonization effort discussed below, these jurisdictions had already published deeds for their particular jurisdictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribution: AtribuciÃ³n</li>
<li>ShareAlike: CompartirIgual</li>
<li>Non-Commercial: NoComercial</li>
<li>NoDerivatives: SinDerivadas</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll see the harmonized translations available now on our license deeds. Please note again that <strong>the deeds are not legally operative</strong>; instead, they play a critical role in helping ensure our licenses are understandable and accessible to users.</p>

<p>Similarly, Creative Commons encouraged its Arab world communities and affiliates to coordinate their translation efforts. They appreciated the importance of harmonizing the key license terms early on so that all Arabic-speaking users would have a consistent experience with CC.</p>
<p>During the recent <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Arab_World_Meeting_2010">CC Arab World meeting</a> this October in Doha, Qatar, a lively discussion among attendees underscored the importance of harmonizing translation within the region. <strong>The challenge again was to balance legal compliance with user-friendly terminology.</strong> At the end of the meeting, CC affiliates and community representatives from six jurisdictions in the region reached a consensus on terms that CC will use for all future license-related work in Arabic. All the participants provided input in a session moderated by Bassel Khartabil and Mahmoud Abu Wardeh at CC's request, with the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribution: Ù†Ø³Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ù…ØµÙ†Ù</li>
<li>ShareAlike: Ø§Ù„ØªØ±Ø®ÙŠØµ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø«Ù„</li>
<li>NonCommercial: ØºÙŠØ± ØªØ¬Ø§Ø±ÙŠ</li>
<li>NoDerivatives: Ù…Ù†Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø´ØªÙ‚Ø§Ù‚</li>
<li>Creative Commons: Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø´Ø§Ø¹ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø¨Ø¯Ø§Ø¹ÙŠ followed by mention of the original English name in parenthesis (Creative Commons)</li>
</ul>
<p>These terms will be deployed in the upcoming Egyptian licenses, as well as across all Arabic deeds and informational materials. <strong>These efforts underscore the cooperative nature of the affiliates and community members who strive to make CC simple and approachable for users across the globe.</strong> We also hope to roll out similar harmonized terms in other languages over the coming months.</p>
