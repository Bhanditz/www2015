<p>For the first time ever, fans are able to legally remix and share their own personal versions of two songs from David Byrne and Brian Enoâ€™s groundbreaking album <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i>. The interactive forum <a href="http://bush-of-ghosts.com">bush-of-ghosts.com</a> has been developed to celebrate the reissue of the album 25 years after its original release.</p>
<p>By agreeing to the terms of download, users will be able to download the component audio for two tracks from <i>Bush of Ghosts</i> â€“ "A Secret Life" and "Help Me Somebody.â€ This component audio is licensed to the public under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license</a>. Consistent with that license, users can legally create remixes and upload them to the site. Visitors can listen to, rate, and discuss the remixes, and are also encouraged to create their own videos, which will be streamed on the site.</p>
<p>When <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i> was first released in 1981, <i>Rolling Stone</i> called it â€œan undeniably awesome feat of tape editing and rhythmic ingenuity.â€ It was widely considered a watershed record. The influence of <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i> is evident in music ranging from the Bomb Squadâ€™s productions for Public Enemy to Moby. The re-mixed and remastered version of the album was released with 7 bonus tracks on April 11.
