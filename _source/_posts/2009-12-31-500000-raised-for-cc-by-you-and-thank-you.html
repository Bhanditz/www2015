<p><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate"><img src="img/cc-shepard-fairey-logo-medium.png" alt="cc-shepard-fairey-logo-medium" title="cc-shepard-fairey-logo-medium" style="float:right;border:none;padding:10px" /></a>We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18166">launched</a> our fifth year-end campaign on October 5 in a very difficult economic environment. Today, the final day of the year, the decade, and last scheduled day of the campaign, we surpassed our goal of raising $500,000.</p>
<p>Three major contributions in the last 24 hours carried us over the top from our board member Eric Saltzman, entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, and the Lewis Charitable Foundation.</p>
<p>Just as exciting, we've received support from more individual donors than in any previous year.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>
<p>If you're a new supporter, you're joining many individuals, corporations, and foundations that have supported our work to build the commons for years. Congratulations!</p>
<p>One new supporter needs to be called out here -- <a href="http://www.lulu.com">Lulu</a> -- for making a very significant multi-year commitment to Creative Commons. Details in a dedicated post soon. Many thanks to Lulu founder Bob Young, one of our original funders.</p>
<p>2009 was a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/milestone">groundbreaking</a> year for Creative Commons. Thanks to you, 2010 should be even better. With your support, we will be working to make the 2010s a decade in which the voluntary commons contributes mightily to realizing the potential of digital networks for the arts, media, education, science, the public sector, and collaboration and innovation across fields.</p>
<p>If you haven't given yet, there's <b>still time to support the commons in 2009!</b> Any amount will help. As a reminder, a <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donation of $75 or more</a> gets you a CC t-shirt designed by artist Shepherd Fairey (image above). For as little as $3.50 you can get swag from our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/store">store</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again. Watch for an analysis of the campaign and lots of exciting initiatives in 2010 -- we'll be asking for your input. Spread the word!</p>
