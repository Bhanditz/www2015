<p>Jim Munroe has released a CC-licensed flash movie called <em><a href="http://nomediakings.org/vidz/time_management_for_anarchists_the_movie.html">Time Management for Anarchists</a></em> and he wants you to remix it (the <a href="http://nomediakings.org/timemanagementforanarchists.fla">.fla</a> source for Flash creators).</p>
<p>The movie gives pretty standard "<a href="http://www.43folders.com">getting things done</a>" advice, as told by famous anarchists "Mike" (Mikhail Bukinin) and "Emma" (Goldman).  It could use male and female voices for Mike and Emma's text and some background <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/">music</a>.</p>
<p>Remix away! Write down the tasks involved in a notebook first. :-)</p>
