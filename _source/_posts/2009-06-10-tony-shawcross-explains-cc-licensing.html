<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12090">Former interviewee</a> and Executive Director at <a href="http://deproduction.org/">Deproduction</a> Tony Shawcross points us towards a <a href="http://www.denveropenmedia.org/node/47852/">recent video</a> he produced to educate the Deproduction community on how CC licenses work. Focusing primarily on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>, the video is informative and to the point, acting as a great primer for those who have never heard of CC or need extra help understanding what our licenses do.</p>
