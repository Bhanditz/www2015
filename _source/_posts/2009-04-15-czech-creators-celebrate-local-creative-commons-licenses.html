<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-14006 alignright" style="margin: 5px;" title="czech-flag" src="img/picture-2.png" alt="czech-flag" width="236" height="153" />Creators can now publish and share their creative works using <a href="http://staging.creativecommons.org/license/?lang=cs">CC's free tools adapted to Czech language and law</a>. CC Czech will be <a href="http://www.creativecommons.cz/2009/03/24/cc-launch-oficialni-spusteni-ceskych-cc-licenci/">throwing an event</a> to celebrate the launch in Prague's <a href="http://dl.avu.cz/lang/en-us/">DigiLab AVU</a> on April 16 during the Multiplace festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.creativecommons.cz/">CC Czech</a> has gathered a lot of supporters since its inception last year. Besides the project's institutional hosts, <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.iure.org');" href="http://www.iure.org/">Iuridicum remedium</a>, <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.nkp.cz');" href="http://www.nkp.cz/">the National Library in the Czech Republic</a>, and the Union of Independent Authors, CC Czech has also received endorsement from the Copyright Department of the Ministry of Culture and Faculty of Philosophy and Arts, Charles University of Prague. The team reports:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: left;"><p>The joint forces of lawyers, librarians, musicians, teachers, artists, geeks, journalists and other specialists delivered not only what we were aiming for - the localized CC deeds and legal codes - but also proof that the ideas behind CC echo in many areas both professional and amateur. From archiving original Czech web content, to educational materials, to works from independent music producers and performers, CC opens up a wide spectrum of possibilities. There is no doubt the today's launch is only the beginning of the Czech Creative Commons story.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our congratulations and gratitude to CC Czech Project Leads Marek Tichy, LukÃ¡Å¡ Gruber, and Petr Jansa for their <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/cz/">efforts in consulting with Czech creators and legal experts to adapt CC's licenses and tools</a>. The launch marks the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/">fifty-second jurisdiction worldwide</a> to offer localized Creative Commons licenses.</p>
