<p>The Art of Community isn't just written for current or would-be community managers. It outlines and discusses all of the issues that are pertinent to simply working with a dispersed community of contributors. These issues are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable processes for management</strong> â€“ how to create day to day processes that are simple, effective and always representative of your community and its members.</li>
<li><strong>Tools and infrastructure</strong> â€“ give your community simple and friction-free tools that they need to do their work, complete with effective communication channels.</li>
<li><strong>Building buzz</strong> â€“ think outside the box and excite and enthuse potential community members to join your crusade, build capacity and keep the train running.</li>
<li><strong>Measuring aspects of community success</strong> â€“ understand, assess and measure your community, discover what can be measured and how to react to the results.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict management</strong> â€“ manage strong personalities that clash, and untangle contentious situations in the open and transparent manner that your community expects.</li>
<li><strong>Handling live events</strong> â€“ organize and schedule productive, fun and engaging live events that get things done and re-affirm social bonds between your community members.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling the community</strong> â€“ as your community grows, things change and adjust to the size, scale and throughput of your membership: handle these changes with as little disruption as possible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are at all interested in what it takes to run a successful community, this book written by the Ubuntu Community Manager will help shed some light on the complex, yet fun, aspects of community management.</p>
