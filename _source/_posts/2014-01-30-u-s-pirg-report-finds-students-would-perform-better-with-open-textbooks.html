<p>The U.S. PIRG Education Fund <a href="http://uspirg.org/news/usp/survey-shows-students-opting-out-buying-high-cost-textbooks">released</a> a report this week called, "<a href="http://uspirg.org/reports/usp/fixing-broken-textbook-market">Fixing the Broken Textbook Market: How Students Respond to High Textbook Costs and Demand Alternatives</a>." The report features responses to a survey administered to over 2,000 students across 163 college campuses in the U.S. in regards to the rising cost of textbooks and how it affects student usage and academic performance. The report has been making the rounds in major news outlets and is highlighted in a <a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/sites/default/files/S.%201704%20Dear%20Colleague.pdf">letter to Congress</a> by Senators Durbin and Franken as a push for the <a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/advocacy/national/act">Affordable College Textbook Act</a>. It is available for anyone to read online under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license</a>, but here are the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TL;DR">tl;dr</a> highlights: </p>
<h3>What the survey results say</h3>
<ul>
<li>65% of students choose not to buy a college textbook because it's too expensive</li>
<li>94% report that they suffer academically because of this choice</li>
<li>48% say they altered which classes they took based on textbook costs, either taking fewer classes or different classes</li>
<li>Senator Durbin wholeheartedly agrees: "According to the students surveyed in this report, the rising cost of textbooks not only adds to the overall financial burden of attending college, it can also have a measurably negative impact on their academic performance and student outcomes."</li>
<li>82% of students say they would do significantly better in a course if the textbook were free online and a hard copy was optional!</li>
<li>Case studies at both <a href="http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/IR/id/2827/rec/1">Houston Community College</a> and <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&article=533">Virginia State University</a> suggest that classes using open textbooks have higher grades and better course completion rates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Textbook industry facts</h3>
<p><em>(as reported by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and the Student PIRGs)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>College textbook prices have increased by 82% in the past ten years, aka 3x the rate of inflation</li>
<li>Though alternatives to the new print edition textbooks exist, the costs of these alternatives (such as rental programs, used book markets and e-textbooks) are still dictated by publishers who re-issue editions every few years</li>
<li>Ethan Sendack at U.S. PIRG <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/28/report-high-textbook-prices-have-college-students-struggling">says</a>: "[Students] can't shop around and find the most affordable option, meaning there's no consumer control on the market."</li>
<li>On average students spend $1,200 a year on textbooks which = 14% of tuition at a four-year, public college; 39% of tuition at community college</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open textbook facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open textbooks are written by faculty and peer-reviewed like traditional textbooks</li>
<li>Open textbooks are free to access, use, download to electronic devices, and affordable to print -- all thanks to the open content licenses on them that legally allows these uses</li>
<li>U.S. PIRG estimates that open textbooks could save each student ~$100 per course they take</li>
</ul>
