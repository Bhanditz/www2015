<p>Sudanese political cartoonist <a href="http://teamopen.cc/khalid/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog5&utm_medium=blog">Khalid Albaih</a> pushes boundaries with his art to reach new viewers and ignite change. &#8220;People should support Creative Commons if they care about what they&#8217;re doing, and they want to get their work to as many people as possible; if they care about collaborating with people all over the world together and coming up with something beautiful&#8230; this is what we&#8217;re supposed to be doing&#160;&#8212; what the internet was made for.&#8221;</p>
<p>YouTube celebrity <a href="http://teamopen.cc/jonathan/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog5&utm_medium=blog">Jonathan Mann</a> gets excited when his work encourages others to create. &#8220;So many people, when they hear what I do, they tell me that they wish that they could be making more of whatever it is they make. They wish that they were more tapped into their creativity.&#8221; He has certainly tapped into his. He began writing and recording a song a day and posting them online under a CC license for anyone to reuse or remix, garnering worldwide attention.</p>
<p>Illustrator and activist <a href="http://teamopen.cc/miyoung/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog5&utm_medium=blog">Miyoung Yi</a> wants to show other Korean artists the value of sharing. She uses her own CC-licensed drawings to carry her message of open across South Korea. &#8220;[Creative Commons] can pave an alternate path to success outside of big capital, big companies, and big industries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stand with Miyoung, Jonathan, Khalid, and thousands of other creators who believe that art is best when it&#8217;s shared. Support Creative Commons and make collaboration and creativity flourish. <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog5&utm_medium=blog">Please donate now.</a></p>
