<p>Independent musicians looking for a way to get paid for their work might want to check out <a href="http://www.pumpaudio.com/">Pump Audio</a>. They serve as a marketplace of independent music for film, tv, and radio, representing thousands of independent artists. The thing that really makes them stand out is that they don't assert control of an artist's copyright, instead signing non-exclusive licenses that last for a year or two.
