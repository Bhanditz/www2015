<p>Today the Creative Commons launched <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/devnations">a new standalone license</a>, dubbed Developing Nations. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/devnations/2.0/">The deed</a> lays it out simply: it's an attribution-only license that applies within developing nations. The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/devnations/2.0/legalcode">legal code</a> defines developing nations as "any nation that is not classified as a 'high-income economy' by the World Bank." which according to the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank's site</a> means it <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/data/countryclass/classgroups.htm#High_income">does not apply in these countries</a>.</p>
<p>
This license can be used in a few ways. It can be combined with something currently licensed under a more restrictive license, so that your photographs could be protected from commercial use in the United States, but if it also carried a Developing Nations license, those same photos could be used commerically in say, Brazil. You might also be a musician or photographer that wants to maintain full copyright in North America and Western Europe, but welcome use by others in the countries of Southeast Asia. More information can be found in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/4397">today's press release</a>.</p>
