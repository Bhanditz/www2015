<p>The winners of last year's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8281">Sparky Awards</a> are now officially up online  (see today's <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/media/09-0203.shtml">press release</a>). The Sparky Awards is "a contest organized by SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) and adopted by campuses nationwide that calls on entrants to creatively illustrate in a short video the value of sharing ideas." The student winners were announced on January 24th in a public screening in Denver. The theme for 2008 was "MindMashup: The Value of Information Sharing", and all four winning teams' videos do a great job of expressing this value in the internet age via online videos, all CC licensed.</p>
<p>My personal favorite, and the grand prize winner, is:</p>
<p>"<a href="http://urliek.blogspot.com/2009/01/sparky-awards-entry.html">To Infinity and Beyond</a>"<br />
by Danaya Panya, Sebastian Rivera, Hemanth Sirandas, Uriel Rotstein, and Jaymeni Patel, University of Illinois at Chicago Honors College</p>
<p>Coincidentally, or fittingly, the winning video was the only video licensed under the attribution-only license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">CC BY</a>), the most open license encouraged for open educational resources (since you can remix it with most anything as long as you credit the original creators---what the <a href="http://sparkyawards.org/">Sparky Awards</a> are all about!). "<a href="http://urliek.blogspot.com/2009/01/sparky-awards-entry.html">To Infinity and Beyond</a>" also had the most student collaborators, demonstrating the value of teamwork and collaboration---an integral component of effective information sharing. </p>
<p>The first and second runners up are also very compelling (and dare I say funny). Licensed CC BY-NC-SA, they are available for you to remix with similarly licensed works:<br />

<p>The fourth video, <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7kaif_growup_creation">GrowUp</a>, received the Special Merit Award and is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/fr/deed.en_US">CC BY-NC-ND</a> (ironically, you can't mash this one up!) by CÃ©cile Iran, Laurie Glassmann, Christophe Zidler, and Aldric de Villartay (University of Versailles-Saint Quentin, France)</p>
<p>Do check them all out on your lunch breaks; they are only two minutes or less! Perfect for internet age attention spans. </p>
