<p>Silicon-Valley-based NGO reinforces its activities around the globe and introduces its innovative copyright licenses in Israel</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, USA and Berlin, GERMANY â€” June 9, 2005 â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides an alternative to full copyright, today unveils a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Israel.</p>
<p>Creative Commonsâ€™ copyright licenses, which are available free of charge from the groupâ€™s <a href="http://creativecommons.org">website</a>, allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>With Israel introducing a Creative Commons license tailored for the specifics of the legal system in Israel, the number of countries where Creative Commons' tools and licenses are available rises to a total of 19. The organization already provides copyright licenses specific to Australian, Austrian, Brazilian, Belgian, Canadian, Croatian, Dutch, English & Welsh, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, U.S., Taiwanese and Spanish law, thanks to a global network of artists, lawyers, and technologists.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative CommonsÂ´offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Dr. Michael Birnhack, co-director of the Haifa Center of Law & Technology (HCTL) and Project Leads Elad Wieder and Ohad Mayblum of the HCTL to adapt the standardized licenses for use in Israel.</p>
<p>Today the licenses will be launched during a ceremony at the HCLT in the Faculty of Law, University of Haifa. As part of the event at the Hecht Auditorium, Professor Lawrence Lessig, Chairman & CEO of Creative Commons will give a live video-conference lecture. In addition, a variety of works by Israeli artists that are using Creative Commons licenses will be exhibited - a body of creative work free to share and build upon. â€œ We are very honored and excited to be collaborating with the Haifa Center of Law & Technology. Being able to offer our licenses in Israel, a country of great creativity and dynamism means a lot to our organizationâ€ said Professor Lawrence Lessig.</p>
