<p>Happy Birthday CC! Today marks the 9th birthday of the CC license suite, as Version 1.0 was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3476">launched</a> in 2002. Since then, more than <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics">500 million works</a> on the web have been made available under one of the CC licenses, free for the public to reuse, remix, or redistribute. </p>
<p>This year we saw CC adoption or policy integration by some major organizations, including Europeana, YouTube, Wired.com, the U.S. Department of Labor, national and local governments in Brazil, in addition to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/newsletter">many others</a>. We also published <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/">The Power of Open</a>, a book featuring successful stories of CC creators sharing knowledge, art, and data using Creative Commons, and held a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011">global summit</a> for CC affiliates and community members from around the world in Warsaw. There, we kicked off the initial Version 4.0 discussion for the CC license suite, the public discussion for which was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30676">announced last week</a> and is now underway. Currently, we are joining efforts with many other open organizations to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30836">prevent SOPA</a> from passing. </p>
<p>I could go on, but I'll stop here to say, <strong>Happy Birthday CC</strong>! To celebrate, watch the video we launched with our license suite in 2002: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos/get-creative">Get Creative!</a> -- and consider <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/">donating to our Annual Campaign</a>, going on now!
