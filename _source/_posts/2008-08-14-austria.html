<h2>More about <a href="http://www.infolaw.at">The Department of Information Technology Law and Intellectual Property Law</a></h2>
<p>In September 2002, the first special chair of Civil Law, Information Technology Law and E-Commerce Law was established in Austria. The Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration has taken this step to provide an institutional frame for this field of legal research and teaching.</p>
<p>Following this appointment, the Department of Information Technology Law and Intellectual Property Law was created as part of the Institute of Civil Law, Commercial Law and Law of Securities.</p>
<p>Both in research and in teaching, the department's main emphasis is on E-Commerce Law, IT-Law, Intellectual Property Law and Competition Law. This includes current legal problems as well as basic/fundamental legal questions. The department's main focus is on practical and interdisciplinary work.</p>
