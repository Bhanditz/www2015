<p><a href="http://digitalfringe.com.au/896?q=node/17">Digital Fringe</a>, a program that will be taking place during the <a href="http://www.melbournefringe.com.au/season/2008/">2008 Melbourne Film Festival</a>, recentlly issued a call for material to screen during this year's program. Taking place between the 9/24 - 10/12, the material will vary in form and content with DF broadcasting the submissions anywhere and everywhere - from public screens to TVs in shop windows to the web. From <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/186">CCau</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Run out of the experimental media bar, <a href="http://www.horsebazaar.com.au/">Horse Bazaar</a> (one of my favourite places in Melbourne - check out the men's toilets!), Digital Fringe showcases the work of emerging and established new media artists on hundreds of screens across Victoria. Contributions can be from anywhere in the world and can be in any form, from works by professional artists to kindergarten multimedia projects and everything in between. You provide the material, they provide the novel environment - whether it be a bar, a gallery, a wall or even a mobile phone. They even have a Mobile Projection Unit, which moves around Melbourne from dusk, projecting onto buildings and structures and interacting with the citylife and local goings on.</p>
<p>And our favourite bit (as always) - the copyright. All artists retain full copyright in their works, and are free to license them however they like, from all rights reserved to public domain. However, in the spirit or sharing and experimentation, Digital Fringe <strong>encourages</strong> the use of Creative Commons licences.</p></blockquote>
