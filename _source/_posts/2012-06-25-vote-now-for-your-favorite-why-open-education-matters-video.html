<p>We're happy to see so many great submissions to the <a href="http://whyopenedmatters.org">Why Open Education Matters</a> video competition. You can now <a href="http://whyopenedmatters.org/videos/">view</a> all the qualifying videos and vote for your favorite. The goal of the competition is to raise awareness of Open Educational Resources (OER) and solicit short, creative videos that help explain what Open Educational Resources are and how they can be beneficial for teachers, students, and schools everywhere around the world. The competition closed on June 5. </p>
<p>Our panel of <a href="http://whyopenedmatters.org/judging/">judges</a> is currently reviewing the entries and will choose the first ($25,000) and second ($5,000) prizes. The winner of the Public Choice Award will win $1,000. Click on a video to view it, read the voting instructions, and vote. Public Choice Award voting will end July 11, 2012. We hope to announce all the winners on July 18, 2012. Good luck!</p>
