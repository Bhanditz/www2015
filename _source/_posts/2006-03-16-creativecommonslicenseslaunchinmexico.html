<p>San Francisco, USA, Berlin, GERMANY, March 16, 2006</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon, today unveils a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Mexico.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">groupâ€™s website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Project Leads Leon Felipe Sanchez Ambia, and Jorge Ringenbach to adapt the standardized licenses to Mexican law. Creative Commons Mexico is being supported by Fulton & Fulton, S.C.</p>
<p>Today the Mexican versions of the Creative Commons licenses will be launched in Mexico City, at a ceremony held in the Andromeda Ballroom at the Hotel Nikko Mexico. At the event that is hosted by Fulton & Fulton, S.C., Professor Lawrence Lessig (Chairman and CEO of Creative Commons) will give the keynote address. As part of the launch event, Emilio SaldaÃ±a QuiÃ±ones, Joint Director General of the Presidencyâ€™s Internet System, will be addressing a speech on the adoption of Creative Commons licenses by the Mexican Presidency to release all of their content published on the internet under a BY-NC-ND 2.5 license.</p>
<p>Leon Felipe Sanchez says, â€œWe got involved in this project focused on the benefits it would carry to, mainly, young creators who are willing to share their works and build upon othersâ€™ works as part of the cultural growth in our country. As lawyers, we also wanted to help the authors get back their power to decide what best suits their needs in relation to their works. Weâ€™re living in a time in which commerce has constrained authorâ€™s rights to the will of big enterprises and this isnâ€™t helping anyone else but themâ€.</p>
<p>Says Jorge Ringenbach â€œWe believe that advanced contracting and intellectual property issues are matters that have great involvement with todayâ€™s technology changes, so what a better way to get involved in such issues that with a project with a noble cause that helps culture spread in a more friendly way.â€</p>

<p>About Creative Commons</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licences provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various foundations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Omidyar Network Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as members of the public.
