<p>It was brought to my attention recently that <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc" target="_blank">mozCC</a> didn't properly display the metadata for some pages, including (embarassingly enough) those at <a href="http://ccmixter.org" target="_blank">ccMixter</a>.  So after an appropriate interval of hacking, swearing and coding, I present mozCC 1.1.</p>
<p>This is a bug fix release, and everyone is encouraged to upgrade.  If you're using Firefox, the update should be picked up by the Update Manager.  Alternatively (or if you're using the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/" target="_blank">Mozilla Application Suite</a>), you can find the release on <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc/install/" target="_blank">the mozCC installation page</a>.  For some more details on the bugs fixed, you can check out <a href="http://yergler.net/blog/archives/2005/06/13/mozcc-11" target="_blank">this blog entry</a>.</p>
