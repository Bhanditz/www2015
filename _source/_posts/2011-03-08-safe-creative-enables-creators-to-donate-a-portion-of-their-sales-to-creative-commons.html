<p><a href="http://www.safecreative.org/">Safe Creative</a> is a Spain-based global intellectual property registry that allows users to publicly assert and identify their rights over a work. Safe Creative supports CC licensing, so you can register<sup>*</sup> your existing CC-licensed works and license your new works that you register. Currently, Safe Creative has over half a million registered works and over 50,000 users. With their advanced search you can <a href="http://search.safecreative.org/advanced-search?work=&user=&workType=&distribution=YES&commercial=&derivations=&recognition=&timelimited=&allowDownload=&allowSale=&allowLicensing=&search=Search">find CC-licensed works Safe Creative users have registered</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.safecreative.org/forcommons-info"><img src="img/licensingforcommons.jpg" alt="" title="licensingforcommons" width="364" height="207" style="float:right;padding:10px" /></a>Recently, Safe Creative <a href="http://en.safecreative.net/2011/03/08/forcommons-licensing-copyright-solidarity/">launched a new platform</a> that allows creators to sell their works directly to users. As part of this new platform, Safe Creative has integrated the ability to donate a portion or all of your sales to two nonprofits: Creative Commons or MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res. After you register your work, you can choose to "Enable Licensing for Commons" and the percentage of the proceeds that you want to go to Creative Commons. A little info box explains CC to Safe Creative creators, and contains the following text:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Why would I want to donate a portion of my proceeds to Creative Commons?</strong><br />
Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that relies on the public's support. If you have ever licensed your work under a CC license, or benefited from using the millions of free, CC-licensed works on the web, donating a portion of your proceeds will help to ensure that CC continues to develop, support, and steward the copyright licenses and tools that make sharing on the web possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Safe Creative has in the past supported Creative Commons by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10135">offering challenges during our annual campaign</a>. It is cool that they have found a new innovative way to support Creative Commons as have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/25925">others recently</a> (if your company is interested in supporting our work, please <a href="https://creativecommons.net/corporate/">get in touch</a>) and we're gratified to be one of two initial choices alongside MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (Doctors Without Borders).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.safecreative.org/sale-info">Check it out</a>, and let us know what you think!</p>
<p><small><sup>*</sup>Note that registration is <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Do_I_need_to_sign_something_or_register_to_obtain_a_Creative_Commons_license.3F"><b>not</b> required</a> to apply a CC license to your work. Publishing your work with a license notice, usually on the web, is all you need to do. In a sense, the web is the registry of CC-licensed works. However, digital copyright registries such as the one run by Safe Creative add value, especially to the extent registrations are exposed on the web, through making it easier to discover the provenance of works, and works themselves. These topics have been <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/TechSummit">explored in depth at three CC technology summits</a>, each of which Safe Creative has presented at.</small></p>
