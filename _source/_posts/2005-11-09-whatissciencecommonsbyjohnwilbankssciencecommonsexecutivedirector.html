<p>Last week, I said this week's email would describe the Science<br />
Commons. Let me introduce John Wilbanks, executive director of the<br />
Science Commons. Here's his description:
<p>Science Commons (SC) was launched in early 2005.   SC is a part of<br />
Creative Commons - think of us as a wholly owned subsidiary - drawing<br />
on the amazing success of  CC licenses, especially the CC community<br />
and iCommons.  But we're also a little different.  Whereas CC focuses<br />
on the individual creators and their copyrights, SC by necessity has<br />
a broader focus.  That necessity is caused by, for example, the fact<br />
that most scientists sign employee agreements that assign<br />
intellectual property rights to a host institution.  Another example<br />
is that scientific journals regularly request that scientific authors<br />
sign over their copyrights, and scientists eagerly do so in return<br />
for citations in what are called "high impact" journals.  There's a<br />
very real collective action problem here:  no one individual or<br />
institution has strong incentives to change the system.</p>
<p>But the system is causing problems in the scientific and academic<br />
communities.  Scientific articles are locked behind firewalls, long<br />
after their publishers have realized economic returns.  This means<br />
that the hot new article about AIDS research can't be redistributed<br />
much less translated into other languages (where it might inspire a<br />
local researcher to solve a local problem).  The difficulties faced<br />
in relation to the "open access" of  publications are easy compared<br />
to those presented when we consider access to tools and data.<br />
Published research indicates that nearly half of all geneticists have<br />
been unable to validate research from colleagues due to problems with<br />
secrecy and legal friction.</p>
<p>So Science Commons works on these problems:  inaccessible journal<br />
articles, tools locked up behind complex contracts, socially<br />
irresponsible patent licensing, and data obscured by technology or<br />
end-user licensing agreements.  We translate this into projects, with<br />
work in three distinctly different project spaces:  publishing<br />
(covered by copyright), licensing (covered by patent and contract)<br />
and data (in the US, covered only by contract). We work on agreements<br />
between funders and grant recipients, between universities and<br />
researchers and between funders and universitiesâ€”all in the service<br />
of opening up scientific knowledge, tools and data for reuse.  We<br />
also promote the use of CC licensing in scientific publishing, on the<br />
belief that scientific papers need to be available to everyone in the<br />
world, not simply available to those with enough resources to afford<br />
subscription fees.</p>
<p><strong>The Publishing Project</strong></p>
<p>Scholarly communication in the sciences generally involves three<br />
components: data generated by experimental research, a peer-reviewed<br />
article explaining and interpreting the data, and metadata that<br />
describes or interprets the underlying data or the article.<br />
Traditionally, journal publishers were predominantly responsible for<br />
gathering, distributing and archiving this information.</p>
<p>The Internet and associated digital networks create a range of<br />
opportunities and challenges for changing the nature of what<br />
information gets stored and communicated, how and when it gets<br />
communicated, and how it is marked with metadata to aid in its use<br />
and reuse.  Science Commons is devoted to using its legal and<br />
technical expertise to help scientific researchers make the best use<br />
possible of these new communication technologies.  For example, some<br />
science publishers experimenting with a new business model for<br />
scholarly communication require authors of peer-reviewed articles to<br />
grant a Creative Commons license in their articles.  These publishers<br />
include the Public Library of Science, BioMed Central, and Springer<br />
OpenChoice.</p>
<p>Science Commons also has convened a working group to discuss other<br />
means for better associating research articles with research data and<br />
for standardizing metadata associated with both of these components.</p>
<p><strong>The Licensing Project</strong></p>
<p>In licensing, we work in a focused manner on the funding of disease<br />
research.  Such work involves a lot of basic science carried out by<br />
many individuals at a diverse range of institutions, both public and<br />
private, and each with different policies about intellectual property<br />
rights, different licensing agreements, and, to some extent, even<br />
different funders. When the research begins to yield the kinds of<br />
leads that might attract drug company attention, it will be desirable<br />
(both in remuneration, and also in encouragement to pharmaceutical<br />
companies interest and participation) to offer drug companies an<br />
efficient package of rights that covers the basic permissions they<br />
need to turn research into viable drugs and treatment regimens. The<br />
current practice will certainly not allow the benefits of such "one<br />
stop shopping."</p>
<p>Using Huntington's Disease research as a case study, Science Commons<br />
is exploring a "technology trust," which will combine an intellectual<br />
property rights conservancy, patent pool and other related rights-<br />
bundling methods.  We are assessing the types of problems of rights-<br />
fragmentation, a range of possible legal solutions to this problem<br />
(including compulsory terms in funder agreements), the institutional<br />
design of the trust or conservancy, and the question of what<br />
institution would be best suited to administer such a trust or<br />
conservancy. While the project aims to produce a method to ameliorate<br />
the problem for Huntington's, we would hope to provide guidelines for<br />
solving such problems more generally.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Project</strong></p>
<p>In the United States, there is no intellectual property right on data<br />
(there is such a right in the European Union, albeit with mounting<br />
evidence that it was not needed). But current expansions in<br />
intellectual property law could generate an entirely new set of<br />
obstacles to sharing data among scientists or with the public.<br />
Extending intellectual property rights to databases are likely to<br />
result in basic data being locked up, made more expensive, or more<br />
easily subjected to restrictive licensing agreements.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a wasteful data economy evolving in which raw<br />
data is not made accessible; scientists are either leery of the risks<br />
of losing control over their data or subject to institutional<br />
requirements that mandate a closed approach. Implicit in data sets<br />
are answers to questions the researcher perhaps did not specify â€“<br />
answers that are a consequence of the throughput of the experiment.<br />
This data could be reused many times over if properly annotated and<br />
preserved. This, however, requires a cultural shift among scientists,<br />
not a technical shift driven by lawyers.</p>
<p>The Science Commons Data project has two aspects. First, we assert<br />
that data should not be covered by intellectual property law. As part<br />
of this project we provide a resource for database providers<br />
struggling with licensing. Second, we are looking to improve on the<br />
data economy by aiding in the construction of an integrated web of<br />
data, papers, tools, and policy with the explicit goal of<br />
facilitating research into brain disease - the NeuroCommons.</p>
