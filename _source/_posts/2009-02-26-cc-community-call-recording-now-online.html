<p>On Monday, February 23, 2009, we hosted our first community conference call. Donors who have given a gift of at least $250 to CC were invited to join members of CC's staff and board, including CEO Joi Ito and Board Chair Jamie Boyle, to discuss what 2009 will look like for Creative Commons, in terms of work to be accomplished and how our work is vital to facilitating a more open and participatory culture. We also took questions and comments from participants. The call was a great success and a valuable opportunity to reach out to and connect with our supporters; we will continue to host community conference calls quarterly and anyone <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/join">giving $250 or more</a> will be invited to take part.</p>
<p>An audio recording of the call is <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/cc-community-call-2009-q1">now available online</a>. Thanks to everyone who participated, and as always, we would like to extend a big thanks to all members of our community for your continued support!</p>
