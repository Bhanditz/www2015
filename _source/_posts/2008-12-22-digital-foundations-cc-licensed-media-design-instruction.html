<p><em><a href="http://digital-foundations.net/">Digital Foundations: Intro to Media Design with the Adobe Creative Suite</a></em> is a new book that aims to teach the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> design and its relation to modern software, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus">Adobe's Creative Suite</a> in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital Foundations uses formal exercises of the Bauhaus to teach the Adobe Creative Suite. All students of digital design and productionâ€”whether learning in a classroom or on their ownâ€”need to understand the basic principles of design in order to implement them using current software. Far too often design is left out of books that teach software for the trade and academic markets. Consequently, the design software training exercise is often a lost opportunity for visual learning. Digital Foundations reinvigorates software training by integrating Bauhaus formal design exercises inspired by the history of art and design into tutorials fusing design fundamentals and core Adobe Creative Suite methodologies. The result is a cohesive learning experience.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Digital Foundations</em>' authors, <a href="http://missconceptions.net/">xtine burrough</a> and <a href="http://mandiberg.com">Michael Mandiberg</a>, have posted their musings on copyright, the public domain, and Creative Commons on the Digital Founation's <a href="http://www.blog.digital-foundations.net/?paged=3">blog</a> through out the book's creation. Similarly, we would be remiss if we failed to mention that while the book focuses on Adobe's Creative Suite, the design principles taught therein are equally applicable to open-source design tools such as <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> and <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.</p>
