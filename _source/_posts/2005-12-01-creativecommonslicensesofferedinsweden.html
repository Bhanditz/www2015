<p>Silicon Valley-based NGO introduces its innovative copyright licenses in Sweden</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, USA and Berlin, GERMANY â€” November 30, 2005 â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon, today unveils a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Sweden.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the groupâ€™s website (http://creativecommons.org). The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials with minimal legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Project Lead Mathias Klang and Karl Jonsson of the Creative Commons Sweden team to adapt the standardized licenses to Swedish law. Creative Commons Sweden is hosted and supported by the IT University of the University of GÃ¶teborg.<br />
Today the Swedish versions of Creative Commons licenses are being launched and will be available at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">the group's website</a>.</p>
<p>As a first official use of the Swedish Creative Commons licenses, the Swedish band Auto-Auto will be releasing their new EP â€œTotemâ€ on December 13, 2005 under a Creative Commons license. â€œTotemâ€ will contain five tracks and will be available for download at the <a href="http://www.auto-auto.se/">band's site</a>. Together with the release, the record company and Internet community Substream are making a remix-kit freely available and will be announcing a competition for the best remix of â€œTotem."</p>
<p>About GÃ¶teborg University and IT University</p>
