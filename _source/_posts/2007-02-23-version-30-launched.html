<p>The latest version of the Creative Commons licenses â€” Version 3.0 â€” are <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">now available</a>.  To briefly recap what is different in this version of the licenses:</p>
<p><strong>Separating the "generic" from the US license</strong></p>
<p>As part of Version 3.0, we have spun off the "generic" license to be the CC US license and created a new generic license, now known as the "unported" license.  For more information about this change, see <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#Further_Internationalization">this more detailed explanation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Harmonizing the treatment of moral rights & collecting society royalties</strong></p>
<p>In Version 3.0, we are ensuring that all CC jurisdiction licenses and the CC unported license have consistent, express treatment of the issues of moral rights and collecting society royalties (subject to national differences).  For more information about these changes, see <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#International_Harmonization_.E2.80.93_Moral_Rights">this explanation</a> of the moral rights harmonization and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#International_Harmonization_.E2.80.94_Collecting_Societies">this explanation</a> of the collecting society harmonization.</p>
<p><strong>No Endorsement Language</strong></p>
<p>That a person may not misuse the attribution requirement of a CC license to improperly assert or imply an association or relationship with the licensor or author, has been implicit in our licenses from the start.  We have now decided to make this explicit in both the Legal Code and the Commons Deed to ensure that â€” as our licenses continue to grow and attract a large number of more prominent artists and companies â€” there will be no confusion for either the licensor or licensee about this issue.  For a more detailed explanation, see <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#MIT">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>BY-SA â€” Compatibility Structure Now Included</strong></p>
<p>The CC BY-SA 3.0 licenses will now include the ability for derivatives to be relicensed under a "Creative Commons Compatible License," which will be listed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses">here</a>.  This structure realizes <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5709">CC's long-held objective</a> of ensuring that there are no legal barriers to people being able to remix creativity in the way that flexible licenses are intended to enable. More information about this is provided <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#BY-SA_.E2.80.94_Compatibility_Structure_Introduced">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Clarifications Negotiated With Debian & MIT</strong></p>
<p>Finally, Version 3.0 of the licenses include minor clarifications to the language of the licenses to take account of the concerns of Debian (more details <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#Debian">here</a>) and MIT (more details <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#MIT">here</a>).</p>
<p>As part of discussions with Debian, it was proposed to allow the release of CC-licensed works under DRM by licensees on certain conditions â€” what was known as the "parallel distribution language" but this has not been included as part of Version 3.0 of the CC licenses.</p>
