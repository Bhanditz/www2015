<p>If you remember Manu Sporny's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7933">Intro to the Semantic Web ... for noobs</a>, released on December 25 and that whetted your appetite for something more technical, Manu has just <a href="http://blog.digitalbazaar.com/2008/01/07/rdfa-basics/">released a video intro to RDFa</a>, one of the metadata technologies Creative Commons is using. Like the previous video, this one and its <a href="http://wiki.digitalbazaar.com/en/Rdfa-basics">source material</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a>.</p>
