<p>Earlier this week, we <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42736">kicked off</a> the <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/">Open Policy Network</a>. We announced that the first project within the Network is the <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/iol/">Institute for Open Leadership</a>. The Institute for Open Leadership is a training program to develop new leaders in education, science, public policy, and other fields on the values and implementation of openness in licensing, policies, and practices. The Institute is looking for passionate public- and private-sector professionals interested in learning more about openness and wish to develop and implement an open policy in their field.</p>
<p>Interested applicants should review the <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/iol/#apply">application information</a> and submit an applicationÂ by <strong>June 30, 2014</strong>. We plan to invite about 15Â fellowsÂ to participate in the first round of the Institute for Open Leadership. The in-person portion of the Institute will be held in the San Francisco bay area in January 2015 (TBD: either January 12-16 or January 19-23). Applications are open to individuals anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>A central part of the Institute will requireÂ fellows to develop and implement a capstone open policy project. The point of this project is for the fellow to transform the concepts learned at the Institute into a practical, actionable, and sustainable initiative within her/his institution. Open policy projects can take a variety of forms depending on the interests of the fellow and the field where the project will be implemented.</p>
<p>Questions about the Institute for Open Leadership should be directed to <a href="mailto:opn@creativecommons.org">opn@creativecommons.org</a>.Â Our thanks to the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society Foundations</a> for funds to kickstart the Institute for Open Leadership.</p>
