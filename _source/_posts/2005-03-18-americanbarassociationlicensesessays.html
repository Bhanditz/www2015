<p>It recently has come to our attention and that the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/home.cfm">American Bar Association</a> has Creative Commons licensed <a href="http://www.patriotdebates.com/">essays</a> on the USA PATRIOT provisions. </p>
<p>
What better a compliment than to have this prestigious association of lawyers use Creative Commons licenses for their content. We're truly honored.</p>
