<p>On Wednesday, Aug 8th, from 7-9 PM, we will be returning to <a href="http://shinesf.com/">Shinesf.com</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1337+Mission+St.+San+Francisco&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">1337 Mission St. in San Francisco</a>) for another <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">Creative Commons Salon</a>! A quick turn-around (last months was to make up for our absence in June while at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fcb/565027189/">iSummit</a>) with tons of wonderful things in store. Apart from the presentations, it is a great opportunity to meet-up with others interested in Creative Commonsâ€™ flexible licensing, technology and standards and informally discuss how we can all work together.</p>
<p>Joining us will be <a href="http://www.ashwinnavin.com/">Ashwin Navin,</a> President and Co-Founder of Bittorent, Inc., who will be discussing the overlaps between the CC community and Bittorent and what this means in the near future. Also, all of this summer's interns (of which I am one) will be presenting on what we've been up to for the past two months. It is bound to be a joyous occasion and one that will surely bring tears to the eyes of the rest of the CC staff.</p>
<p>As always, music and drinks will top everything off. Here is the link on <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/199764/">Upcoming</a> - we'll see you there!</p>
