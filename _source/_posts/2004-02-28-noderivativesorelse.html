<p>The New York Times today <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/28/national/28PUBL.html">reports</a> on a surreal U.S. Treasury Department Policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone who publishes material from a country under a trade embargo is forbidden to reorder paragraphs or sentences, correct syntax or grammar, or replace "inappropriate words," according to several advisory letters from the Treasury Department in recent months.</p>
<p>Adding illustrations is prohibited, too. To the baffled dismay of publishers, editors and translators who have been briefed about the policy, only publication of "camera-ready copies of manuscripts" is allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article does not make clear whether the policy rationale stems from concern for the moral rights of authors in rogue nations.</p>
