<p>On July 6, 2011, the Creative Commons Board of Directors held an official meeting via teleconference.</p>
<p>Since I stepped into the role of CEO at Creative Commons in March, staff and I have been hard at work, completing a successful <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27006">office move</a> from San Francisco to Mountain View, CA, where we now work in proximity to many of our strongest supporters; improving internal communications among a distributed staff; and achieving significant public milestones, such as the publication and global launch of <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/">The Power of Open</a>.</p>
<p>At the Board meeting, I reported on these and other major CC developments to date, and the Board reviewed goals and outcomes related to each. We discussed results from the CC All Staff Meeting in Half Moon Bay, The Power of Open launch, the <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/6689">amicus brief</a> we filed in the Golan Supreme Court case, changes in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people">staffing</a>, fundraising, and the process for setting CC <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Strategy">strategy</a>. The Board reiterated their support for all of these activities, and stated their continued commitment to strengthening CC's international presence in science, education, technology, and culture. We also discussed progress in adding support for the international Affiliate Network, and the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Meeting_2011">Global Meeting</a> to be held on September 15-18 in Warsaw, Poland, where the Board plans to meet face-to-face for a full day.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the Board approved a revised budget for CC for 2011. As an organization, we are very excited for the next few months as we continue to work towards realizing Creative Commons' <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about">vision</a>!</p>
