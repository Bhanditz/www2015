<p>Last week, a bill enabling the California Community Colleges to integrate open educational resources (OER) into its core curriculum was signed into law by Governor Schwarzenegger. <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_2261&amp;sess=CUR&amp;house=B&amp;author=ruskin">AB 2261</a> authorizes the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges "to establish a pilot programÂ to provide faculty and<span> staff from community college districts around the state with the information, methods, and instructional materials to establish open education resources centers." The program would provide a structure by which community college faculty and staff could vet and repurpose OER in order to create high quality course materials and textbooks for college students. The resulting materials would themselves be openly licensed or available in the public domain so that they could be further adapted and repurposed for future and individual contexts. High quality OER would also set a new and much needed economic standard for publishers, who currently charge exorbitant prices for college textbooks. According to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-textbook18-2008aug18,0,7294220,full.story">LA times</a>, textbook prices accounted for almost 60% of a community college student's educational costs last year.</span></p>
<p><span>This legislation is spearheaded by Assemblyman <a href="http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a21/leg.htm">Ira Ruskin</a> and <a href="http://plotkin.com/">Hal Plotkin</a>, President of the Foothill and De Anza Community College District's Governing Board of Trustees. Hal writes,</span></p>
<p>"<em>This is the first legislation that puts the state of California squarely behind those of us who are working to create free, high-quality, vetted public domain -- or "open" -- educational resources for community college students, who stand to save literally hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming decade as a result. </em></p>
<p><em>The scholar David Wiley has observed that introducing Open Educational Resources into the public education system is the most significant development since the establishment of Land Grant colleges and universities in the mid 1800's.</em></p>
<p><em>What's also wonderful is the knowledge that, even in these difficult days when our system seems so very broken, an ordinary citizen like me can still offer up a useful idea and see it enacted into law.</em>"</p>
<p>See the news article on this <a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=9525">here</a>, and the latest version of the bill <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_2261&amp;sess=CUR&amp;house=B&amp;author=ruskin">here</a>. The <a href="http://www.fhda.edu/">Foothill-De Anza Community College District</a> in Silicon Valley is a leading institution in the open education movement; they established the <a href="http://cccoer.wordpress.com/">Community College Consortium for Open Educational Resources (CCCOER)</a> last year, which exists "to identify, create and/or repurpose existing OER as Open Textbooks and make them available for use by community college students and faculty."</p>
