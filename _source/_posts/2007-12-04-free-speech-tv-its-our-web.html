<p><a href="http://freespeech.org/">Free Speech TV</a> just uploaded their new video, <a href="http://freespeech.org/ourweb/">"It's Our Web"</a>, choosing to release it under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">BY-NC-SA license</a>. The video focuses on current changes happening online, contrasting the increased focus on opening up content with the threats that face this movement. From FSTV:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a truly pivotal time for the Internet, the most powerful and interactive medium humans have ever seen.   New commercial incursions by big online media enterprises including the widely distained "Facebook Beacon", make explicit what new media giants have been doing quietly for some time; searching for new and evermore effective ways to sell our attention, our clicks and our private information to advertisers and marketers.</p></blockquote>
