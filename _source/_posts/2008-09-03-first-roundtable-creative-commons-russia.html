<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 'First Roundtable on the Introduction of Creative Commons licenses in the Russian Federation' will be organized on Tuesday, September 9, 2008 between 16:30 and 19:00 in central Moscow. The roundtable will be chaired by Anton Nossik (SUP) and Syb Groeneveld (Creative Commons Russia).</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/">Creative Commons International</a> has been working with almost 50 local Creative Commons jurisdiction projects to port the licenses to their respective Copyright legislation. However, the CC licenses have not yet been ported to the Russian Federation. With the support of Syb Groeneveld (CC Ambassador for the Russian Federation) and his initiative to revive the discussion by hosting a first roundtable with IT and IP experts, we hope to get the porting process in the Russian Federation started in the near future.</p>

<blockquote><p>To date, the CC-licenses have not been ported to the Russian Federation. This does not mean there is no activity or interest in CC. The opportunity of introducing CC licenses in the Russian Federation has been studied. Various public and private institutes have organized well-visited lectures on the topic and the first companies, institutes and artists are planning to work with the Russian license. However not much progress has been made to start the adaptation and localization of the licenses to Russian law.</p>
<p>This Roundtable will therefore bring together a small group of legal, Internet and policy experts to set an agenda on the introduction of the licenses in the Russian Federation. The outcome should be a broadly supported six months roadmap towards introduction of the licenses and, where possible, a division of the tasks to be conducted in this process. Although places for the event are limited (max 12 people) please contact Syb Groeneveld and let him know if you are interested in the event by sending an email to syb at creativecommons dot org.</p></blockquote>
