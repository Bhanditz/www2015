<p>The DJ Vadim remix contest currently under way at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/djvadim">ccMixter</a> ran afoul of server outages and other shenanigans yesterday so we decided to extend the deadline 48 hours to accommodate entries that could not access the site yesterday. The new deadline is 9 PM PDT Saturday April 21 (4 AM GMT Sunday April 22).</p>
<p>The contest has been a huge boon to the site bringing <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/10DOUILL/9713">great new talent</a> and bringing out <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/stefsax/9794">the best in old-timers</a>. We look forward to working with BBE Records again.</p>
