<p>If you haven't already, break up your Monday with the <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=Cf7SBEwRDEhdXP3JOlrh7g_3d_3d">OER Copyright Survey</a>. It only takes ten minutes, and it's for a good cause---mainly to "gather information regarding the ways in which copyright law plays a role in, and perhaps acts as a barrier to, the practices of those who create or facilitate the production of Open Educational Resources (OER)."</p>
<p>From the survey page,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Because most content remains "all-rights-reserved" under the traditional rules of copyright, it is often the case that the creators and producers of OER must confront questions as to when and if it is permissible to use content created by others when it is not offered under an open license. For example, an OER creator may want to incorporate a clip from a film into a lesson about film techniques, or an animated video illustrating a biological process into a lesson about that process. However, if the film clip or animation is protected by â€œall-rights-reservedâ€ copyright, then the OER creator may be unsure how to proceed, or may wish to rely on some exception to copyright law that may apply under such circumstances.</p>
<p>It is our goal to develop a deeper awareness of the degree to which OER practitioners and users grapple with copyright law issues, and whether those issues pose barriers to the creation, dissemination, and reuse of OER. We hope that this initial survey will form the basis of a larger international study led by ccLearn."</p></blockquote>
<p>The survey closes on August 31, so fill it out soon!</p>
