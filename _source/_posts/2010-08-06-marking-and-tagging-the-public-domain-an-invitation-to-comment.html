<p>Almost 1Â½ years have passed since we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13304">launched CC0 v1.0</a>, our public domain waiver that allows rights holders to place a work as nearly as possible into the public domain, worldwide, prior to the expiration of copyright. CC0 has proven a valuable tool for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21473">governments</a>, <a href="https://proteomecommons.org/news.jsp?i=660">scientists</a>, <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/05/21/flickr-shapefiles-public-dataset-10/">data</a> <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/">providers</a>, providers of <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.heise.de%2Fnewsticker%2Fmeldung%2FOpen-Access-Bibliotheken-geben-Katalogdaten-frei-954945.html&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en">bibliographic data</a>, and many others throughout world. At the time we published CC0, we made note of a second public domain tool under development -- a tool that would make it easy for people to tag and find content already in the public domain.</p>
<p>We are publishing today for comment our new <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/demos/pd/">Public Domain Mark</a>, a tool that allows works already in the public domain to be marked and tagged in a way that clearly communicates the workâ€™s PD status, and allows it to be easily discoverable. The PDM is not a legal instrument like CC0 or our licenses -- it can only be used to label a work with information about its public domain copyright status, not change a workâ€™s current status under copyright. However, just like CC0 and our licenses, PDM has a metadata-supported deed and is machine readable, allowing works tagged with PDM to be findable on the Internet.  (Please note that the example used on the sample deed is purely hypothetical at the moment.)</p>
<p>We are also releasing for public comment <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Public_Domain_Norms">general purpose norms</a> -- voluntary guidelines or â€œpleasesâ€ that providers and curators of PD materials may request be followed when a PD work they have marked is thereafter used by others. Our PDM deed as well as an upcoming enhanced CC0 deed will support norms in addition to citation metadata, which will allow a user to easily cite the author or provider of the work through copy-paste HTML.</p>
<p>The public comment period will close on <strong>Wednesday, August 18</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup>. Why so short? For starters, PDM is not a legal tool in the same sense our licenses and CC0 are legally operative -- no legal rights are being surrendered or affected, and there is no accompanying legal code to finesse. Just as importantly, however, we believe that having the mark used soon rather than later will allow early adopters to provide us with invaluable feedback on actual implementations, which will allow us to improve the marking tool in the future.</p>
<p>The primary venue for submitting comments and discussing the tool is the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-licenses">cc-licenses</a> mailing list. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
