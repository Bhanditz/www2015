<p>The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7760">good people</a> over at <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/">Jamglue</a> are at it again, this time giving you the opportunity to remix American hip-hop artist <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/contests/jrwriter?src=bnr">J.R. Writer's "Where You At"</a> and Japanese Baile Funk emcee <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/contests/tigarah">Tigarah's "Color, Culture, Money, Beauty"</a>, with some very nice prizes for the respective winners. </p>
<p>Both remix contests use CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">BY-NC-SA</a> licenses on instrumental tracks, meaning you have access to cut up and modify each individual sound for your remix. While Jamglue has gotten a hold of some amazingly diverse and talented groups previously (see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7683">here</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7603">here</a>), it is just as important to recognize <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/mixes">the quality and variety of the community remixes</a>. By using CC-licensing, Jamglue allows artists to open up their content to fans in a way that not only allows for positive interaction and creation, but also maintains the commercial interests of the artists at hand.</p>
