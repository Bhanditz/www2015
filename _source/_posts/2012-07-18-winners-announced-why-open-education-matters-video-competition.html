U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SdrhGrcvsk">announced the competition with a video</a> on the Why Open Education Matters website.

<p>The prize winners were decided by a panel of distinguished experts including Davis Guggenheim, Nina Paley, Liz Dwyer, Anya Kamenetz, James Franco, Angela Lin, and Mark Surman. Due to technical problems with the public voting on the Why Open Education Matters website which prevented some persons from submitting a vote, the third prize video has been awarded by the judging panel.</p>
<p>In addition to the winning videos, all of the qualifying videos <a href="http://whyopenedmatters.org/videos">are available for viewing</a> on the competition website, <a href="http://whyopenedmatters.org">http://whyopenedmatters.org</a>. All of the videos are licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, which means others may distribute, remix, and build upon them, even commercially, as long as they give credit to the creators.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to everyone who submitted a video for sharing their creativity, talents, and passion in helping explain and promote Open Educational Resources.</p>
