<p>We're excited to announce the recipient of our Google Policy Fellowship for the Summer 2009 is Aurelia Schultz of Vanderbilt University Law School. You'll hear more about what she'll be working on shortly.</p>
<p>We also wanted to extend our congratulations to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/alumni#102">Brian Rowe</a>, our 2008 CC legal intern for nabbing <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a>'s GPF position. You can read <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2009/03/introducing-2009-class-of-google-policy.html">about all the other fellows over at the Google Policy blog</a>.  Congratulations to all the fellows and thanks again to Google for sponsoring such a fantastic program!</p>
