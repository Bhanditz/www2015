<p><a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/">Fotopedia</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/">UNESCO World Heritage Center</a>, has created a breathtaking new <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/heritage">application</a> for the iPhone and iPad. The app builds on the concept of a coffee table book, updating and enhancing the browsing experience for the web.</p>
<p>UNESCO World Heritage "seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity." With <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list">911 properties</a>, UNESCO has identified 890 heritage sites around the world. Now for the first time, you can access these sites as one comprehensive collection via the <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/heritage">Fotopedia Heritage</a> project.</p>
<p>This project would not be possible without Creative Commons, as over 18,000 of the pictures in Fotopedia Heritage book are under one of the CC licenses. The pictures come from all around the world; as individual photographers and organizations license their high quality photos under Creative Commons, the book will only grow as a community contributed and shareable resource.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie Hullot, CEO of Fotopedia, writes, "I believe it is a terrific showcase for what Creative Commons enable[s]. The biggest photo book ever... growing everyday with only high quality and 100% relevant pictures due to our community-based curation process." From the <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/products/heritage-info">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fotopedia Heritage is a new way to experience Fotopedia, the first collaborative photo encyclopedia. The team led by Jean-Marie Hullot (former CTO of NeXT and Apple's application division) built the application while the Fotopedia community added and curated the photos thus ensuring high relevance and quality.</p>
<p>Explore our heritage deeper and deeper navigating carefully chosen tags, learn more about each place reading rich descriptions from UNESCO and Wikipedia and browse an interactive map, localize precisely each site. And if you are planning a trip, you will be just one click away from TripAdvisor travel information for the World Heritage Sites you are interested in.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/heritage">Fotopedia Heritage</a> book currently has over 20,000 pictures. Find out more about how you can <a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/heritage/contribute">contribute</a>!</p>
