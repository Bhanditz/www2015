<p>The Department of Law at the University of Turin will lead the license translation, while the CNR Institute of Electronics and Information and Telecommunications Engineering (IEIIT-CNR) will take the tech lead. </p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, USA and Turin, Italy</strong> &mdash; Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative works free for copying and re-use, announced today that it would expand its International Commons (iCommons) project to Italy. </p>
<p>"We're very excited to have Turin's Department of Law working with us to bring iCommons to Italy," said Lawrence Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford, at the CSI-Piemonte convention on 'Knowledge as Public Common Property.' "Our cultural commons, needless to say, would not be complete without their participation." </p>
<p>"In a world where the space for creativity is shrinking dangerously, Creative Commons is acting to keep this area open. There was a dire need for this initiative, and we are proud to participate in the project," explained Professor Marco Ricolfi, project lead and professor of intellectual property law at the University of Turin. </p>
<p>Professor Marco Ajmone Marsan, Director of IEIIT-CNR said: "We are glad to offer the technical skills of our Institute in the field of Information and Communication Technologies to support the activities of Creative Commons in Italy." </p>
<p>First announced in March this year, iCommons is Creative Commons' project to make its machine-readable copyright licenses useful worldwide. As the affiliate institution for iCommons in Italy, Turin's Department of Law will coordinate public efforts to translate the Creative Commons licenses literally and legally &mdash; so that they are accessible in the Italian language and suit the Italian legal system. </p>
<p>In taking up iCommons, Italy joins Brazil, Japan, Finland, Ireland, China, and Taiwan in the international effort. </p>
<p>The Department of Law at the University of Turin will field comments in archived email discussions on the Creative Commons website: </p>
