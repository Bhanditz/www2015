<p>A little while ago, we blogged about the recent decisions - <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5830">one</a> in Spain and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5823">one</a> in the Netherlands - that have been handed down that involve Creative Commons licenses. English translations of these are now available for those people whose Spanish or Dutch is a little rusty.  The Spanish one is <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/judgements/SGAE-Fernandez-English.pdf">here</a>; the Dutch one  <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/judgements/Curry-Audax-English.pdf">here</a>.</p>
