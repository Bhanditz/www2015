<p>In addition to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24866">changing</a> their default licensing policy from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a> to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, the University of Michigan has enabled even greater sharing and reuse by releasing more than half a million bibliographic records into the public domain using the CC0 public domain dedication. Following on the heels of the British Library, who just <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24973">released three million bibliographic records into the public domain</a>, the University of Michigan Library has offered their <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/open-access-bibliographic-records">Open Access bibliographic records</a> for <a href="http://ckan.net/package/umich-marc-records-cc0">download</a>, which, as of November 17, 2010, contains 684,597 records.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan Library has always been particularly advanced in regards to open content licensing, the public domain, and issues of copyright in the digital age. To learn more, see the John Wilkin's <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2010/11/29/open-bibliographic-data-how-should-the-ecosystem-work/">post</a> and help to improve the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/University_of_Michigan_Library">case study</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, ever since we rolled out the CC0 public domain dedication, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data">CC0 use for data</a> has been on the increase. Check out the wiki for all <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data">current uses of CC0</a>, and feel free to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">add</a> case studies of any that are missing. </p>
