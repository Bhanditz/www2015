<p><a title="http://learn.creativecommons.org/" href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">ccLearn</a>'s Executive Director, <a title="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#82" href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#82" target="_blank">Ahrash Bissell</a>, will give a talk at Open Source Lab's fourth official workshop, a series that features various speakers promoting openness across a variety of fields. The <a title="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/" href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/" target="_blank">Open Source Lab at Stanford</a>Â was founded just last November, and already hosts video content from three past workshops on their site. The ccLearn workshop will be held tomorrow, April 23rd, at 3pm in the Learning Theater on campus. Ahrash will speak on:</p>
<p>"Open source, open content, open practices. What is â€œopenâ€, why is it compelling, and where is all of this heading? I will focus on recent developments in the open education movement, including the hopes, challenges, and promising advances in this international effort. We can discuss any number of things, including: the establishment of and current work at ccLearn (including a federated search project, best-practices in (CC) licensing, etc.), the Cape Town Open Education Declaration, key barriers to the implementation of open educational resources (OER) in both higher education and K-12, international efforts and coordination, technical platforms for enabling participation (OER creation, use, and adaptation), and more."</p>
<p>In homage to its content, the event is also open to the public---here are the <a title="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/2008/04/08/23/" href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/opensource/cgi-bin/blog/2008/04/08/23/" target="_blank">details</a>. But don't worry if you can't make it; according to co-founder Henrik Bennetsen, a video of the workshop will be available on their site later. Â </p>
