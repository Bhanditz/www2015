<p>Creative Commons has always <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F">recommended</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Tools">used</a> free and open source licenses for software. We have long <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3921">provided</a> a deed and metadata wrapper for the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/">GPL</a>.</p>
<p>Occasionally we've highlighted free software that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6126">complements CC licensed media</a>, free software that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6026">we create</a>, and pragmatic and philosophical <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6157">correspondences</a> between <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6053">free software and free culture</a>. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#51">Alex</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#53">Jon</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#31">Nathan</a> were added to CC staff in part on the strength of their contributions to free software projects.</p>
<p>Until <a href="http://creativecommons.org/software/">now</a> we haven't had a section of our website dedicated to explaining and showing examples of free and open source software, as we have for CC-licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/">audio</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/image/">images</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/video/">video</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/">text</a>, and  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education/">educational materials</a>. Undertandable given that CC licenses are not recommended for software, but an oversight given the synergies between free culture and free software and that the relevant <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F">FAQ item</a> is easily overlooked.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://creativecommons.org/software/">creativecommons.org/software</a> or click on "software" from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons home page</a>. Look for software "featured commoners" as well as more exciting CC integration with media player, content creation and publishing software in the coming months!</p>
