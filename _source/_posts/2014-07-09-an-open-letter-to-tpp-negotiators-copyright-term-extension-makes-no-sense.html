<p>Today, Creative Commons and over 35 other organizations published an <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/letter-tpp-copyright-term-extension-proposals">open letter</a> urging negotiators of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) to rescind a proposal to extend copyright terms by another 20 years beyond its current, mandatory term.</p>
<p>This week, 12 Pacific rim countries are meeting in Ottawa, Canada, to continue secret negotiations of the widely criticized TPP trade agreement. Under the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPS_Agreement">TRIPS agreement</a>, signatories are required to enact legislation granting copyright protection to individuals for the life of the author plus another 50 years. TPP negotiators, under the influence of large rights-holding companies, want to add another 20 years to the minimum copyright term.</p>
<p>If adopted, this extension would work to keep creative works out of the public domain for decades beyond the current term. It's essentially a double-life sentence for all new works. This would be an incredible loss for the commons.</p>
<p>All creativity and knowledge owes something to what came before it - every creator builds on the ideas of their predecessors. Copyright is a limited right that is given to creators, but it also has a term limit to ensure we all benefit from culture and knowledge. Both the rights granted to creators and rights afforded to the public are necessary for a vibrant culture and the proliferation of knowledge. And the "Commons" in Creative Commons starts with the public domain. It's the original corpus for remix. It's why we've developed tools to <a href="/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">better mark</a> and <a href="/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">dedicate</a> content to the public domain. Together with hundreds of millions of works whose creators have chosen to share under generous terms of reuse with CC licenses, the commons is growing richer everyday.</p>
<p>Extending the term of copyright will undermine the potential of the public commons and needlessly limit the potential for new creativity. There is no logical reason to increase the term of copyright - an extension would create a tiny private benefit at a great cost to all of us. Most people agree that the existing term already lasts far past the amount of time required to incentivize creation (the original purpose of copyright) by granting creators a limited monopoly over a creative work. Copyright should strike a balance, giving an incentive to create while also giving the public permission to use and build on that creativity. In 2002, CC co-founder Lawrence Lessig argued against an additional 20 years of copyright protection in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft"><em>Eldred v. Ashcroft</em></a>. Even Milton Friedman opposed the copyright term extension, <a href="http://www.lessig.org/2006/11/only-if-the-word-nobrainer-app/">calling it a "no-brainer."</a> Nearly all contemporary economists agree.</p>
<p>Increasing the term of copyright protection harms the commons. Any public policy that will further delay their entry into the public domain is contrary to the values we support - realizing the full potential of the Internet through universal access to the creativity that promotes active participation in culture and society.</p>
<p>Participating countries should should reject any measure in the Trans-Pacific Partnership introduced to increase the term of copyright protection. And TPP negotiations should be held in public and with the input of a broad set of stakeholders that include civil society and public interest representatives.</p>
<p>Although the letter has been presented to TPP negotiators today, they will remain open for further signatories to express their support.
