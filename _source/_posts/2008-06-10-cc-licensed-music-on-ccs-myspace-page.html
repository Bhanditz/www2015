<p>We wanted to recognize and celebrate the hard work and talent of musicians all over the world registering their songs under cc licenses - so we now feature a handful of such songs on CC's Myspace page. CC's page on this social network site receives a steady flow of visitors each day, and posting songs there will allow visitors to see (and hear!) first-hand how well-received CC's work has been in the music world.</p>
<p>The song selection will change from time to time and we would definitely appreciate suggestions of cc-licensed tunes produced by you or a musical artist you know. Make suggestions via "Send Message" on the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/creativecommons">Creative Commons Myspace page</a>.  Be sure to drop by soon to hear cool tunes from talented musicians around the world!</p>
