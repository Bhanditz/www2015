<p>Congratulations to Mozilla on the <a href="https://mpl.mozilla.org/2012/01/03/announcing-mpl-2-0/">release of the Mozilla Public License 2.0</a> after a two year versioning process. As Mozilla chair Mitchell Baker <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/01/03/mozilla-public-license-version-2-0-released/">writes</a> "Version 2.0 is similar in spirit to the previous versions, but shorter, better, and more compatible with other Free Software and Open Source Licenses."</p>
<p>MPL 1.1 is one of the more popular free and open source software licenses, most famously used for Mozilla's own Firefox browser. That MPL 2.0 is now <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2011/12/06/mozilla-public-license-2-0-and-increasing-public-copyright-license-compatibility/">compatible</a> with the GPL, the most popular free and open source software license, is a big step forward for software. Why? Read <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html"><em>Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else.</em></a> which we link to in our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F">FAQ explaining why CC licenses shouldn't be used for software</a> (except <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27081">CC0</a>). But the principle of lessening incompatibility among licenses is a general one, and applies to licenses used for cultural and scientific works, public sector information, databases, and more, as well as software. Thus one of our highlighted goals for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">version 4.0 of the CC license suite</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interoperability â€“ maximize interoperability between CC licenses and other licenses to reduce friction within the commons, promote standards and stem license proliferation;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a difficult goal, requiring long-term thinking and collaboration with other license stewards. We have a number of other goals for version 4.0 of the CC license suite as all; we hope the cumulative effect will make for a much better license suite than 3.0. Of course each license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8213">e.g., BY-SA</a>) will also remain similar in spirit. Shorter? We'll see, balanced with everything else.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://mpl.mozilla.org/2012/01/03/announcing-mpl-2-0/">MPL 2.0 announcement</a> notes, numerous people made valuable contributions to the development of that license. Possibly a first for a software license, even <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2011/08/22/making-html-legal-documents-like-mpl-look-good/">making the license look nice</a> was addressed -- something CC thinks is important, and another opportunity for people with different skills to help make licenses more useful. With a far greater diversity of projects using CC licenses, our need for community-wide feedback is even greater. We urge you to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">get involved in the CC 4.0 process</a>.</p>
