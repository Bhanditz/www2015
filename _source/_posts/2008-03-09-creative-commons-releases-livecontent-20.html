<p>Creative Commons is pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LiveContent_2_0" title="LiveContent 2.0">LiveContent 2.0</a>, a LiveDVD of Creative Commons-licensed multimedia content and free and open source software. LiveContent allows users to explore open content such as music, video, photography, books, and educational materials that can be freely used, copied, and built upon. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The LiveContent project draws CC-licensed multimedia content from a variety of diverse projects aiming to share creativity and culture more openly. Included are photographs from Flickr.com and Wikimedia Commons, music from Jamendo.com and Simuze.nl, videos from Make Magazine, Boing Boing TV and others, books from Manybooks.net, and open educational resources from MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative.</p></blockquote>
<p>LiveContent 2.0 builds upon the previous release by demonstrating a unique content "autocuration" process with Flickr.com, and calls for the further development of technologies that make it easier to spread and reuse CC-licensed content.</p>
