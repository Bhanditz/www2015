<p><a href="http://www.overmundo.com.br/overmixter/recombina/view/contest/home">RecombinaSOM</a> is a remix contest taking place as part of the <a href="http://www2.ufscar.br/home/index.php">SÃ£o Carlos's Federal University's </a>multimedia festival, "<a href="http://www2.ufscar.br/servicos/noticias.php?idNot=2049">Contato</a>". The festival's theme is recombination and will feature a number of discussions on new forms of licensing and exchanging content among audiovisual/music producers. RecombinaSOM itself will is being hosted by both  <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> and <a href="http://www.overmundo.com.br/">overmundo</a>, their collective effort being billed <a href="http://www.overmundo.com.br/overmixter/">Overmixter</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contato's theme and curatorial leading concept in this edition is "Recombination" - a remix contest as well as the Creative Commons initiatives (already part of the daily routines of "Radio UFSCar", one of the Festival promoters), fit well together. Beyond these facts, the copyright debate (one of the debate's theme of the Festival) will join participants of the multimedia  Brazilian website "Overmundo" (Golden Nica - Ars Eletronica winner) and  CTS (Centro de Tecnologia e Sociedade da FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas), an institution that coordinates Creative Commons in Brazil.</p>
<p>The Contest will be host by 'Overmixter", a partnership between CCmixter and "Overmundo", and will bring samples from the bands that are participating in the festival and material from the festival audio identity. The contest organization also will record and share samples during the festival - live presentations at the radio, live material from the gigs and more. 10 remixes chosen by the public will be part of the "Radio UFSCar" daily programming during he following three months and the first place remix chosen will be part of a compilation the station releases once a year called "Transmissoes Independentes" (its first edition is available on Jamendo). The compilation had 2 thousand copies downloaded this year and the media is distributed free of charge.</p></blockquote>
