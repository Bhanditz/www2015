<p>Yesterday, I had the pleasure of speaking on a panel at the <a href="http://www.calawyersforthearts.org/musicseminar2004.html">California Laywers for the Arts, Music Business Seminar</a>. It was a great event -- we discussed how the Internet is affecting commercial music distribution, and business models.  In the context of the file-sharing debate, I spoke about how Creative Commons can <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed-music">clarify whether artists want their works to be shared</a>. I also put forth our vision of creating a market where people can sell sampling friendly content, as is demonstrated on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">WIRED CD</a>.  Imagine if the next U2 album included sampling rights, and you could interact with your music to create something new -- that would be amazing.</p>
