<p>Thanks to the help of  Dr. Darius Whelan and Louise Crowley, at <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/law/">University College Cork</a>, we're working on porting Creative Commons licenses to Irish law. There is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/ie/">an iCommons Ireland page</a> with links to the discussion and a full <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3909">press release</a> describing the undertaking.</p>
