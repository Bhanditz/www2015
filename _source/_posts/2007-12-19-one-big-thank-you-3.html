<p>This past weekend over 1000 people celebrated CC's 5th birthday in San Francisco, Berlin, Beijing, Manila, Seoul, Belgrade, Brisbane, New York City, and Los Angeles. We are so excited that so many people came out and showed their support for the work Creative Commons has done, is doing, and will continue to do in the future.</p>
<p>If you partook in the celebrations - please tag your photos or videos with CC5Bday so that everyone may enjoy all the celebrations that happened this past weekend. Also, keep an eye out for Lawrence Lessig's presentation from the CC SF party, it will be online soon.</p>
