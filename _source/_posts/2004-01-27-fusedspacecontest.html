<p>
An interesting contest has just opened for entries, called <a href="http://www.fusedspace.org/">Fusedspace</a>. "An international design competition on innovative applications for new technology in the public domain" is how they describe themselves but keep in mind the term "public domain" in this case is more specific to public spaces. The contest is set to give away over 17 thousand Euros in prize money for the best proposals that meld public spaces, technology, art, and community. Entry deadline is April 30th.</p>
