<p><a href="http://owlmm.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-content-jamendo.html">Owl Multimedia has more than doubled the number of CC licensed tracks you can search</a> via audio similarity (sounds like a mp3 you already have) or keywords. How? By adding over 10,000 tracks from <a href="http://jamendo.com">Jamendo</a>.</p>
<p>You can find CC music through music via the <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/?engine=owl">CC Search Portal</a> or directly at <a href="http://www.owlmm.com">Owl Multimedia</a>.</p>
