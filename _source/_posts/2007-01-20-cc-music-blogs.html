<p>It's easy to predict that 2007 will be a good year for CC music when out of the gate three (that we know of) all-CC-all-the-time sites spring up:</p>
<p>First up from Belgium there's <a href="http://www.netlabelism.net/">NetLabelism</a> who are on their way to Den Haag to talk to our good buddy and CC music champ <a href="http://marcoraaphorst.nl/">Marco Raaphorst</a>. </p>
<p>Next is the audio/video site <a href="http://gwire.org">generationWIRE</a>. Check out the <a href="http://gwire.org/listenaudio.php?id=51">audio section</a> which has been featuring a hand picked selection from <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>. </p>
<p>From Brazil there's  Bruno Vellutini's very cool <a href="http://ccnelas.blogspot.com/">ccNeLas</a> who says "Since I've been listening to excellent songs published under Creative Commons licenses, I decided to create this music blog and promote these artists." </p>
<p>And while we're at it, the venerable <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/">Black Sweater, White Cat</a> has taken the baton from <a href="http://indieish.com/2006/12/31/day-365-chenard-walcker-auld-lang-syne/">cc365</a> (Grant Robertson's unique CC artist per day project for 2006) with the all new <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/search/label/BSWC%20One-a-Day">BSWC One-a-day</a>. I'll be doing a call-in to their <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/search/label/BSWC%20-%20The%20Show">live radio show</a> tonight at 6 PM PST (9 EST) to ask why they aren't playing more <a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/armchair">Professor Armchair</a> on their show.</p>
