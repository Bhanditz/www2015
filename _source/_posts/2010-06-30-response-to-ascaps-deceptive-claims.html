<p>Last week, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) sent a fundraising letter to its members calling on them to fight "opponents" such as Creative Commons, falsely claiming that we work to undermine copyright.*</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses are copyright licenses â€“ plain and simple. Period. CC licenses are legal tools that creators can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving other rights. Without copyright, these tools don't work. Artists and record labels that want to make their music available to the public for certain uses, like noncommercial sharing or remixing, should consider using CC licenses. Artists and labels that want to reserve all of their copyright rights should absolutely not use CC licenses.</p>
<p>Many musicians, including acts like <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/main/faq">Nine Inch Nails</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">Beastie Boys</a>, <a href="http://www.intrahealth.org/section/open">Youssou N'Dour</a>, <a href="http://urlyd.com/releases/tone-small-arm-of-sea/">Tone</a>, <a href="http://www.curtsmithofficial.com/music/album/all-is-love">Curt Smith</a>, <a href="http://bush-of-ghosts.com/remix/bush_of_ghosts.htm">David Byrne</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/radiohead/">Radiohead</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Yunyu">Yunyu</a>, <a href="http://kristinhersh.cashmusic.org/">Kristin Hersh</a>, and <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/featured_programs/show/remixsnoop">Snoop Dogg</a>, have used Creative Commons licenses to share with the public. These musicians aren't looking to stop making money from their music. In fact, many of the artists who use CC licenses are also members of collecting societies, including ASCAP. That's how we first heard about this smear campaign â€“ many musicians that support Creative Commons received the email and forwarded it to us. Some of them even included a donation to Creative Commons. </p>
<p>If you are similarly angered by ASCAP's deceptive tactics, I'm hoping that you can help us by <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donating to Creative Commons</a> â€“ and sending a message â€“ at this critical time. We don't have lobbyists on the payroll, but with your support we can continue working hard on behalf of creators and consumers alike. </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Eric Steuer<br />
Creative Director, Creative Commons</p>
