<p><a href="http://epicfu.com/">Epic FU</a>, the web-based art/tech/music/culture show we recentlly profiled as a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8674">Featured Commoner</a>, just posted <a href="http://epicfu.com/2008/09/fight-for-your-right-indie-mus.html">a great episode</a> that includes an interview with CC's Creative Director Eric Steuer. For those who are familiar with CC there isn't a ton of new information on what we do but for those who are new to CC, the interview acts as an awesome primer. The episode is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a> and Steve Woolf, one of Epic FU's founders, <a href="http://blog.epicfu.com/2008/09/creative-commons-means-content.html">posted a related entry</a> about CC on the Epic FU blog to complement  the piece.</p>
