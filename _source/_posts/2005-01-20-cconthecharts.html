<p>Ok, <a href="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_01.20.05/music/ahl.html">#9 on the Toronto Eye's Anti-Hit List</a>, with very some cool company. It's a start!</p>
<p>Here's the Eye's pick on CC Mixter: <a href="http://ccmixter.org/file/trompkins/1">fake french [le tigre est fatiguÃ©]</a>, featuring samples from several <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">WIRED CD</a> tracks.</p>
<p>It's about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5196">discovery</a> now.</p>
