<p>Ken Taylor, managing editor of XLR8R Magazine:<br />

<p>About Christopher Willits</p>
<p>Christopher Willits is a musician and multimedia artist located in San Francisco, California. Striking a delicate balance between acoustic and electronic sounds and systems, Willits manages to defy genre distinctions while still defining a sound unto his own. His numerous solo releases cover a broad spectrum of musical styles, and include one main commonality: Willitsâ€™ unique use of the guitar with custom-made signal processing. This home-brewed software, along with Willitsâ€™ 6-string prowess, generates a unique real-time mixture of improvised melody and rhythm. On his breakthrough LP, Surf Boundaries, Willits merges the patterns of his signature guitar sound with treated strings, brass and five-part vocal harmonies for a sonic vision that draws upon elements of shoegaze, jazz, ambient and noise.  The San Francisco Weekly named Willits â€œthe center cell of a rather complex indie rock-avant-garde electronic art Venn diagram.â€</p>
