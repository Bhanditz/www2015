<p>Nick Shockey is the Director of the <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/">Right to Research Coalition</a> (R2RC) and the Director of Student Advocacy at the <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/">Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition</a> (SPARC). Â The R2RC is an international alliance of 31 graduate and undergraduate student organizations, representing nearly 7 million students, that promotes an open scholarly publishing system based on the belief that no student should be denied access to the research they need for their education because their institution cannot afford the often high cost of scholarly journals. We spoke to Nick about similarities in the open access and open educational resources movements, the worldwide student movement in support of access to scholarly research, and the benefits of adopting Creative Commons tools for open access literature.</p>

<p>â€œIt all started in a hotel room in Paris,â€ explains Shockey, who while studying abroad at Oxford and on a brief trip to France happened to catch a CNN special about <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MITâ€™s OpenCourseWare</a> (OCW) program. Nick was immediately impressed by the idea of OCW, and upon his return to Trinity University campaigned to get his school to implement a similar program. For a number of reasons, OCW didnâ€™t catch on at Trinity, but the experience Shockey gained in advocating for it provided him with two crucial pieces that led to his work at SPARC: a deep interest in opening up the tools of education, and an introduction to Diane Graves, Trinityâ€™s University Librarian and then SPARC Steering Committee member. Shockey began advocating for open access to research at Trinity, and convinced the student government to pass a resolution supporting the <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/issues/frpaa/index.shtml">Federal Research Public Access Act</a> (FRPAA), as well as a later resolution endorsing the Student Statement on the Right to Research. The statement calls for students, researchers, universities, and research funders to make academic research openly available to all. These principles formed the foundation for what was to become the Right to Research Coalition.</p>
<p><strong>Growth of R2RC</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In the summer after Shockey moved to Washington D.C., he was able to add new signatories to the Student Statement on the Right to Research, including the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS) and the National Graduate Caucus of the Canadian Federation of Students. It soon became clear that a larger impact could be made by organizing as a coalition that actively advocated for and educated students about open access, and Nick joined SPARC full time to lead the Right to Research Coalition.</p>
<p>R2RC has grown to include 31 member organizations and now represents nearly 7 million students worldwide. â€œThe incredible diversity of our membership speaks to how important access to research is to students,â€ says Shockey. R2RCâ€™s members range in size from groups with less than a hundred students to organizations with more than a million. But Nick notes that all the member groups have two things in common: they believe students should have the benefit of the full scholarly record (not just the fraction they or their institution can afford), and they recognize that the Internet has made unfettered access possible by driving down the marginal cost to distribute knowledge virtually to zero.</p>
<p><strong>Federal open access advocacy</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>SPARC and the Right to Research Coalition have been supportive of the Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA), a law which would require 11 U.S. government agencies with annual output research expenditures over $100 million to make manuscripts of journal articles stemming from research funded by that agency publicly available via the Internet. While FRPAA didnâ€™t pass in 2010, Shockeyâ€™s very happy with the remarkable progress made, which culminated last year in the Congressional hearing on the issue of public access to federally funded research. Shockey, colleague Julia Mortyakova, and R2RC members have been advocating in support of FRPAA in various ways, such as letter-writing campaigns and in-person office visits. Shockey estimates his membership has reached out to well over two hundred Congressional offices.</p>
<p><strong>Student support for OA around the world</strong></p>
<p>Shockey describes that the current situation of limited access to academic research is a widespread problem that affects students all around the world. But, he explains that the real difference isnâ€™t between the United States and the rest of the world, but between the developed and the developing world. â€œPaying $30 for access to one article is expensive even for many researchers in the U.S.,â€ says Nick, â€œbut when you realize that $30 is an entire average monthâ€™s wage in Malawi, you can see the huge disparities in access faced by huge swaths of people around the world.â€</p>
<p>At the end of last summer, R2RC began a concerted effort to expand their coalition to incorporate international student groups, and launched <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/blog/access-around-the-world-student-stories-of-access-.shtml">their Access Around the World blog series</a> to feature stories and activities from students across the globe. In fall 2010, Shockey pitched the importance for student access to scholarly research to the European Medical Studentsâ€™ Associationâ€™s General Assembly in Athens and the European Studentsâ€™ Conference in Berlin. â€œThe students understood the issue right away and have gotten involved immediately,â€ says Nick. The President of the European Medical Studentsâ€™ Association has already made a presentation on Open Access and the R2RC at a major international medical conference, and just this month, the coalition welcomed the <a href="http://www.ifmsa.org/">International Federation of Medical Studentsâ€™ Associations</a> (IFMSA), the worldâ€™s largest medical student organization, which operates in 97 countries around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Access is crippled by cost; OA enables novel downstream benefits</strong></p>
<p>The high cost to users to access academic journals and educational materials is a criticism shared by advocates of open access (OA) and open educational resources (OER). Scholarly journal prices have increased at 200% the level of inflation, similar to that of college textbook prices. Shockey believes that the that the greatest value of open access is to help knock down the prohibitive barriers that high prices pose to individual users. â€œA singe U.S. university we studied spent about $900,000 for only 96 journal subscriptions--and that was at a well-funded school,â€ says Shockey. â€œAt less wealthy institutions, or those in the developing world, the price barriers often prove insurmountable. Students and researchers must make do with what their school can afford rather than what they need.â€</p>
<p>Nick explains that through open access, the entire scholarly record could be available for anyone to read and build upon, leading to innumerable public benefits. Â But heâ€™s most excited by the uses of open access scholarship we canâ€™t even think of at the moment. â€œLawrence Lessig points out that the real â€˜secret sauceâ€™ of the Internet is that you donâ€™t need anyoneâ€™s permission to innovate on it,â€ says Shockey, â€œand I believe open access will finally bring this ability to academic research.â€ Nick describes a world of open access in which researchers will not only be able to read any article, but also be permitted to perform semantic text mining to uncover trends no one person could discover and connect together. But for this promise to be fulfilled, he reinforces that researchers need access to the entire scholarly record, not just a selected subset, and the rights necessary to reuse these articles in new and interesting ways.</p>
<p><strong>Open access and Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p>Shockey explained that Creative Commons plays a crucial role within the OA movement by providing a standard suite of prepackaged open content licenses. â€œTo make an obvious point,â€ he said, â€œvery few researchers are also copyright lawyers, and the CC licenses make it simple for scholars and journals to make their articles openly available. CC also helps prevents a patchwork system where itâ€™s unclear which uses are allowed and which are not.â€ Â Nick notes that this sort of ambiguity can be very harmful--particularly to reuse of content, so itâ€™s important that the open access community leverages CC to ensure access and communicate rights.</p>
<p>Shockey says that the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license has become the gold standard for open access journals. In general, scholars want recognition for their work, and the CC BY license ensures attribution to the author while allowing anyone to read, download, copy, print, distribute, and reuse their work without restriction. Shockey notes that several studies have shown a strong increase in article views and citations when an article is made openly available. â€œThis makes intuitive sense,â€ Nick says. â€œIf an article is available for more people to read and build upon, itâ€™s unsurprising that it will also tend to be cited more often. Given the importance of citation counts in academic advancement, the citation increase can be an important benefit that flows from open licensing.â€</p>
<p><strong>OA support via the university</strong></p>
<p>Open access (and increasingly, OER) initiatives at universities have been promoted in part through the university library. For example, at some schools librarians help educate faculty and students about the options available to them for scholarly publishing, including administering the <a href="http://scholars.sciencecommons.org/">Scholarâ€™s Copyright Addendum</a>. Shockey thinks that the library is a natural central organizing venue for OA and OER work, and meshes well with the libraryâ€™s fundamental mission to provide their community with access to the educational resources they need. Â Nick also noted that libraries are perfectly positioned to play an OA/OER organizing role because they are one of the only institutions that reaches every department and every member of the campus community. Shockey said that some libraries have already taken the lead by supporting initiatives such as the <a href="http://www.oacompact.org/">Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity</a> (COPE), which sets aside money to pay for the publication fees that some open access journals charge, in order to help transition to an open model.</p>
<p><strong>OA and OER working together</strong></p>
<p>Open access advocates argue that access to scholarly literature should not be limited to scientists and academics, but available to patients, parents, students at all levels, entrepreneurs, and others. Shockey believes that since the OA and OER movements are both working to enable free access to the tools of education, itâ€™s important to explore the ways in which these movements can work together. Even though the R2RC is centered on open access, itâ€™s begun to weave OER into its messaging alongside open data and open science. Nick thinks itâ€™s important for R2RC members to see the larger network in which they work. â€œWhen we hit roadblocks in one area,â€ said Shockey, â€œthere are often opportunities in others, and advancing one of these pieces (be it OA, OER, open data, open video, etc) opens the door for further progress in other areas. Furthermore, once youâ€™ve convinced someone about one of these issues, be it a friend, colleague, or the U.S. Congress, itâ€™s much easier to engage them on the others.â€</p>
<p>Shockey is optimistic with regard to the future of the student open access movement, but stresses the need to move ahead with the clear vision that advancements in education, science, and scholarship require access to raw research materials. â€œWe must always remember what it is weâ€™re fighting for,â€ said Shockey, â€œacademic research is the raw material upon which not only education but also scientific and scholarly advancement depend. When we allow these crucial resources to be locked away, it hinders the entire mission of the Academy - student learning suffers, scholarly research is impeded, and scientific discoveries are slowed.â€ Nick says that widespread open access promises to benefit science and scholarship in radical ways that are almost unimaginable today. â€œOpen access will improve how we teach, learn, and solve problems in ways that are impossible within a closed system.â€</p>
<p>While there are many ways to get involved with the Open Access movement, Shockey stressed that the most important was simply to learn about this issue of access to research and start conversations with friends, colleagues, mentors, and students to raise awareness. Â The R2RC website has <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/individual.shtml">an individual version of their Student Statement on the Right to Research</a> open for anyone to sign, as well as a host of other education and advocacy resources for those interested in Open Access.</p>
