<p><em>
<p>Just a quick note to say I just downloaded your MP3 from the harvard.edu<br />
site. It's good to know that my music was good enough to be included in<br />
your report. I enjoy fact that other people can  appreciate it and use it<br />
freely in their own work.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>My friend Benjamen Walker received this email the other day.</p>
<p>(Ben is the guy behind the <a href="http://www.bostonphoenix.com/supplements/the%5Fbest/00/text/ae%5Faural.html">award-winning</a> and cult-fave Boston radio show <a href="http://yourlight.org/">Your Radio Nighlight</a> and <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/">our own cartoons</a>' sound design.)</p>
<p>Ben recently produced <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/audio/gadget">a short piece</a> for Harvard's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center</a>'s great <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/audio/">AudioBerkman project</a> called "<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/audio/gadget">The Gadget Factor</a>." The segment takes "a closer look a cool new class of high-tech toys -- the portable MP3 player -- to find out what effect these devices are having on the world of online music." </p>
<p>The piece features interviews with media analysts and lawyers -- including both EFF's <a href="http://www.eff.org/homes/fred_von_lohmann.php">Fred Von Lohmann</a> and the RIAA's <a href="http://www.riaa.com/about/leadership/default.asp">Cary Sherman</a>. And like all Ben Walker radio pieces of late, it is built around loops of Creative Commons-licensed music.</p>
<p>For "Gadget," Ben used CC'd tunes by <a href="http://www.wayneandwax.com/">Wayne Marshall</a>, <a href="http://www.opsound.org/opsound/pool/norelpref.html">Norel Pref</a>. and <a href="http://www.opsound.org/opsound/pool/laurielaptop.html">Laurie Laptop</a> -- who authored of the email above.</p>
<p>Another satisfying CC story.</p>
