<p><a href="http://www.witness.org/index.php">WITNESS</a>, an international human rights organization founded by pop musician Peter Gabriel, <a href="http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/98846">announced yesterday</a> the launch of <a href="http://hub.witness.org/">The Hub (Beta)</a>, a place for users to view and contribute human rights-related media - a potential "YouTube for Human Rights".</p>
<p>Of note to the CC-community is that The Hub's users are "advised to publish contents under a Creative Commons license", which would allow others to freely redistribute Hub videos without fear of legal ramification. Using a flexible license that allows for the free flow and sharing of information enables The Hub users to publicize human rights atrocities as far and wide as possible, increasing awareness to the issues without any legal hurdles.</p>
