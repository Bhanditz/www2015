<p>Emulating MIT and a host of other <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=160">OCW</a> institutions, the Stanford School of Engineering has jumped on the OER bandwagon by releasing ten of its courses online in multiple formats. The pilot open courseware portal, known as <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/default.aspx">Stanford Engineering Everywhere</a> (SEE), is Stanford's first move towards offering full-length course videos and other materials online for free and open use. SEE's current <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx">ten course offerings</a> consist of "instruction videos, reading lists and materials and class assignments" in three subject areas: computer science, artificial intelligence, and linear systems and optimization.</p>
