<p>In November <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30533">we wrote</a> that the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">Office of Science and Technology Policy</a> (OSTP) was soliciting comments on two related Requests for Information (RFI). One asked for feedback on how the federal government should manage <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/11/04/2011-28623/request-for-information-public-access-to-peer-reviewed-scholarly-publications-resulting-from">public access to scholarly publications</a> resulting from federal investments, and the other wanted input on <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/11/10/2011-29166/request-for-information-public-access-to-digital-data-resulting-from-federally-funded-scientific">public access to the digital data</a> funded by federal tax dollars.  </p>
<p>Creative Commons submitted a response to both RFIs. Below is a brief summary of the main points. Several other groups and individuals have submitted responses to OSTP, and all the comments will eventually be made available on the OSTP website. </p>

<ul>
<li>The public funds tens of billions of dollars in research each year. The federal government can support scientific innovation, productivity, and economic efficiency of the taxpayer dollars they expend by instituting an open licensing policy.</li>
<li>Scholarly articles created as a result of federally funded research should be released under full open access. Full open access policies will provide to the public immediate, free-of-cost online availability to federally funded research without restriction except that attribution be given to the source.</li>
<li>The standard means for granting permission to the public aligned with full open access is through a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license.</li>

<ul>
<li>If the federal government wants to maximize the impact of digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research, it should provide explicit, easy-to-understand information about the rights available to the public.</li>
<li>The federal government should establish policies that insure the public has cost-free, unimpeded access to the digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research. Access to this data should be made available as soon as possible, with due consideration to confidentiality and privacy issues, as well as the researchersâ€™ need to receive credit and benefit from the work.</li>
<li>The federal government can grant these permissions to the public by supporting policies whereby 1) data is made available by dedicating it to the public domain or 2) data is made available through a liberal license where at most downstream data users must give credit to the source of the data. CC offers tools such as the CC0 waiver and CC BY license in support of these goals.</li>
</ul>
