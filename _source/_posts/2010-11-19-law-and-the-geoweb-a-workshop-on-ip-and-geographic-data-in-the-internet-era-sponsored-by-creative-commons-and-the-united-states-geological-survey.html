<p><strong>Law and the GeoWeb</strong><br />
A workshop on "Intellectual Property and Geographic Data in the Internet Era" sponsored by Creative Commons and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in conjunction with the annual meeting of AAG, April 11, 2011, Seattle, Washington. The workshop will be held at the campus of Microsoft Research, and will be streamed live on the Internet.</p>
<p>This workshop will focus on intellectual property issues with geographic data, exploring situations when users and creators ranging from individuals to local, state and federal agencies as well as private companies and non-profits create, share and reuse geographic information from different sources over the Internet in their projects.</p>
<p>For more information, please see <a href="http://punkish.org/geoweb/index.html">http://punkish.org/geoweb/index.html</a> or search on Twitter for #lawandgeoweb</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br />
U.S Copyright Law protects tangible original works with creative content but the law also ensures that facts, that is, data that are discovered rather than invented, remain free for everyone's benefit. This ideas/expression dichotomy creates a lot of issues in the Internet age when information is very easily created, shared, used and reused.</p>
<p>With inexpensive computing and networking power available to everyone, geographic datasets are increasingly being created, shared and used by individuals, grassroots organizations, and private corporations. These data come with different expectations with regards to how they may be used resulting in a hodgepodge of licensing and contractual obligations that hinders data interoperability. Mixing data of different provenance creates new data with typically more restrictive licensing conditions. Public agencies may be unable to mix licensed data with government data due to restrictive licensing terms of the resultant dataset, and thus, may be unable to capitalize on and benefit from user-generated content.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop Structure</strong><br />
The current line-up of speakers from federal, state and local agencies, Creative Commons, grassroots agencies, intellectual property lawyers, the geospatial industry, and research and academia includes:</p>

<li>Greg Babinski, King County, State of Washington</li>
<li>Michael Brick, Microsoft Legal, Bing Maps</li>

<li>Diane Peters, General Counsel, Creative Commons</li>
<li>Tim Trainor, Bureau Chief, Geography Division, US Census Bureau</li>
<li>Paul Uhlir, Director, Board for Research Data and Information, NRC</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the workshop will encourage discussion and participation.</p>
