<p>Once again the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase">Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase</a> has selected great creative works to include in the latest version of Ubuntu, this version due out in April.  As with the previous Show Case, all of the winning entries will be bundled with the Ubuntu release and licensed under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license.  This time, however, there were three categories, so three winners.  The categories are: Audio, Video, and Image.</p>
<p>The winning audio entry was by <strong>Jean Francois Marais</strong> (aka: <a href="http://moshang.net/">MoShang</a>) for his song "<a href="http://moshang.net/MoShang-Invocation.ogg">Invocation</a>."  Invocation is from his <a href="http://stonebell.moshang.net/default.html">Stone Bell EP</a>.</p>
<p>Taking the video category is <strong>Robbie Ferguson</strong> for his video "<a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Category5-SpiritOfUbuntu595.ogv">Spirit of Ubuntu</a>" (ogg video).  Robbie hosts the <a href="http://www.category5.tv/">Category 5 Technology TV</a> show which is a live question and answer style show.  His entry is a discussion of the Ubuntu community and what it means.</p>
<p>The winning image is a photograph by <strong>William J McKee Jr</strong> titled "<a href="http://fc30.deviantart.com/fs38/i/2008/334/4/e/Canadian_Clouds_by_m0deth.jpg">Canadian Clouds</a>" that was taken soon after crossing the boarder into Canada from New York State.</p>
<p>Amazing works from all 3 winners (for more information on the winners, see the <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/2009/03/24/ubuntu-904-free-culture-showcase-winners/">official announcement</a>), and the group of submissions (still available on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase">submission site</a>, but only temporarily) was of great quality!</p>
<p>Be sure to remember that this contest will happen for each new Ubuntu release, which is <strong>every 6 months</strong>.  So, get those submissions ready for the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase">Free Culture Showcase</a> for Ubuntu 9.10 released in October of this year!</p>
