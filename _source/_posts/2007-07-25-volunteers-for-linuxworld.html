<p><a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/">The LinuxWorld Conference and Expo</a> is quickly approaching, and as always, we are incredibly excited. This time though, it isn't only because of the amazing things we will see and hear about (which are bound to be numerous) but also because it is the first time we are reaching out directly to you in the CC Community to lend a hand.</p>
<p>Our staff is small, and LinuxWorld quite large. We are looking for a few volunteers to help out at our booth by meeting/greeting people and doing some general tasks. CC schwag will be involved and, of course, you get into LinuxWorld Exhibition for free!</p>
<p>LinuxWorld runs <strong>August 7-9, from 10AM-5PM</strong>, at the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco. We are looking for 2-3 volunteers, who will be split up in 2-3 hour shifts through out the day. CC staff will be on hand the whole time, so don't worry about being stranded in a sea of open-source-dom. If you are interested, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:events@creativecommons.org">events @ creativecommons.org</a> with a little bit about yourself (any CC-related items are a plus!) and we will get back to you ASAP.</p>
