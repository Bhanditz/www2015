<p>On day 2 of <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org">CC10 </a>we focus on what makes CC more than just a bunch of licenses - our community. </p>
<p>We give a long over-due introduction to Creative Commons for those who haven't met us yet, with a favorite resource from one of our global volunteer affiliates: <a href="http://www.creativecommons.qa/">CC Qatar</a> presents <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1j0OA9N4hs">Meet Creative Commons</a>. At the same time, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35540">discuss</a> CC's geek-cred with Josh Wattles, adviser to one of our oldest artist communities - <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantART</a> - and we examine how a simple licensing decision can create community around a work, with <a href="https://twitter.com/gkjohn">Gautam John</a> of <a href="http://prathambooks.org/">Pratham Books</a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, today we get our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC10">CC10 community parties</a> started. Not 1, not 2, but 3 separate birthday events are happening around the world tonight. <a href="http://de.creativecommons.org/2012/11/20/am-8-12-feiert-berlin-10-jahre-creative-commons/">CC Berlin</a> brings us keynotes, talks, interviews and a DJ, in a party themed around the success and impact CC has built over the past 10 years. Meanwhile <a href="http://www.creativecommons.be/?q=relaunch">CC Belgium</a> is rebooting itself with a showcase of Creative Commons artists and projects. And finally, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC10_San_Francisco">CC Headquarters</a> has its own party in San Francisco, where CC staff, Board and community members will participate in interactive exhibits, live remixing (brought to you by <a href="http://globallives.org/">Global Lives</a> and <a href="http://dublab.com/">Dublab</a>) and general good-cheer. We'll have a tweet wall at the event - so if you want to be part of it, just <a href="https://twitter.com/creativecommons">tweet us</a> your birthday wishes after 5pm San Francisco time tonight.</p>
