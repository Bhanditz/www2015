<p>Public discussion on the Creative Commons translation license starts this Monday (April 26). The translation license would be used by authors who want to make their works available for others to translate into local languages. The initial idea for the license came from a lecturer at a conference in South Africa in January this year. He said that he found it virtually impossible to get permission from authors to allow him to translate articles into local languages for use by his students. </p>
