Magnes museum</a> is a museum of art and history focused on the Jewish experience located in Berkeley, California. Since late 2007 the museum has been posting their digital assets both on their website and on their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/magnesmuseum">Flickr account</a>. On Flickr, all of the high resolution images are licensed under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed.en">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives</a> license. The image to the left is of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/magnesmuseum/3365069093/in/set-72157615580610840/">19th century Turkish Wedding dress</a> which <a href="http://magnes.org/opensourceblog/?p=108">was a gift from Sara Levi Willis</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, the museum has been blogging at their <a href="http://www.magnes.org/opensourceblog/">opensource blog</a>, but you can also check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/magnesmuseum/collections/">all of their collections on their Flickr account here</a>. As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11637">more</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11326">more</a> cultural institutions come online, it is important to recognize those that understand the value in sharing their assets, so congratulations to The Magnes for taking the lead!</p>
