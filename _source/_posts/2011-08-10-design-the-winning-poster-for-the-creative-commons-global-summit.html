<p><a href="http://www.loftwork.com/blog/pickup/ccsummit2011-poster/?lang=en_US"><img src="img/ccposter-global-summit.png" alt="" title="ccposter global summit" width="720" height="230" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28611" /></a>You may have <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27141">heard</a> about the Creative Commons Global Summit to be held in Warsaw, Poland this September. In the lead up to its public launch later this week, we want you, our community, to get involved! </p>
<p>Some of our CC affiliates in Asia are hosting a poster design competition for the summit, based on the theme, â€œPowering an Open Future.â€</p>
<p>From the website,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Creative Commons Global Summit 2011 provides an opportunity for volunteers, industry leaders and practitioners of the worldwide open content licensing movement to explore and showcase the past, present and future of Creative Commons, copyright and free culture. It will be an event focused on sharing, openness and collaboration, with an eye towards setting the path for the Creative Commons community over its next 10 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>The winning designs (judged by an international panel and by popular vote) will be introduced at the Global Summit with people in attendance from all over the world, featured prominently at the venue and also as part of a CC visual arts exhibit. The designer will receive a gift of the printed poster from a professional publishing company in Warsaw.</p>
<p>All submissions must be licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> license and incorporate the CC Global Summit logo (see above for what that looks like). For the complete submission rules and to enter, visit the <a href="http://www.loftwork.com/blog/pickup/ccsummit2011-poster/?lang=en_US">competition site</a>. (In the case you are not fluent in Japanese, you can change the language to English in the upper right hand corner.)</p>
<p>The deadline is August 22 (Japan time & in less than two weeks!), so we look forward to seeing your creativity in action!</p>
