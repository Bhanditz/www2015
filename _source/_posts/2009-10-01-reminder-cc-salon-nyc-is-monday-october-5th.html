<p>Just a quick reminder that October's CC Salon NYC is Monday night!</p>
<p>We've got a brand new home for the Salons - <a href="http://openplans.org/">the Open Planning Project</a> has generously offered their incredible penthouse.</p>
<p>So come out to have some beers with the CC community watch some cool presentations, and meet some new faces in the free culture space.</p>
<p>October's Salon will feature short presentations from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-clark-estes">Adam Clark Estes</a>, director of citizen journalism at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpostinvestigativefund.com/">the Huffington Post Investigative Fund</a> talking about how the HuffPo is using CC to fuel the future of journalism, <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/community/blogosphere/bloggers/author/bernsteins/">Shelley Bernstein</a>, Chief Technology Officer of <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/">the Brooklyn Museum</a> discussing their <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/brooklyn-museum">amazing community and commons efforts</a>, and myself discussing some current CC projects, achievements, and a sneak peak at what I've been working on for <a href="http://creativecommons.net">the Creative Commons Network</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p><strong>Monday, October 5th,  from 7-10pm<br />
The Open Planning Project<br />
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=148+Lafayette+St+New+York,+NY+10013+USA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;split=0&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=1q2qStXJBY6llAew4ZjqBg&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">148 Lafayette St</a><br />
Between Grand &amp; Howard<br />

<p>We'll have free (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_beer">as in beer</a>) beer.  If you've didn't make it to any past CC Salons, don't miss this one, and if you did, <strong>you'll know to come early as space is limited</strong>.</p>
