<p>Today marks the launch of the <a href="http://www.openaccessbutton.org/">Open Access Button</a>, a browser bookmark tool that allows users to report when they hit paywalled access to academic articles and discover open access versions of that research. The button was created by university students David Carroll and Joseph McArthur, and announced at the <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11/">Berlin 11 Student and Early Stage Researcher Satellite Conference</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://oabutton.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/students-launch-button-to-put-denied-access-to-research-on-the-map/">press release</a>:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The Open Access Button is a browser-based tool that lets users track when they are denied access to research, then search for alternative access to the article. Each time a user encounters a paywall, he simply clicks the button in his bookmark bar, fills out an optional dialogue box, and his experience is added to a map alongside other users. Then, the user receives a link to search for free access to the article using resources such as Google Scholar. The Open Access Button initiative hopes to create a worldwide map showing the impact of denied access to research.</p></blockquote>

<p>The creators have also indicated that they plan to release the data collected by the Open Access Button under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>. Congratulations on the release of this useful tool. </p>
