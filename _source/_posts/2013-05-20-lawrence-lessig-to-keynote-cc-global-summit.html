<p>This week we have two exciting announcements about our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2013">Global Summit</a>, the bi-annual gathering of our community which will be held in Buenos Aires in August 2013.</p>
<p>First - we are pleased to confirm that Professor Lawrence Lessig, <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10519/Lessig">Roy L. Furman Professor of Law</a> at Harvard Law School, and one of Creative Commons' founders and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/board#lawrencelessig">current Board members</a>, will be presenting a keynote at this year's Summit. Anyone familiar with Creative Commons is likely to be familiar with Professor Lessig, who for the last decade has been one of the leading advocates for a more open copyright system worldwide and a popular public face of CC. If you are one of the few people who are unfamiliar with Professor Lessig's work, you can see an example of his inspirational speaking style in his TED talk from 2007, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity.html">Laws that choke creativity</a> (he also spoke on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim.html">reform of US political funding</a> in 2013). Details of the time and subject of Professor Lessig's talk will be distributed closer to the event.</p>
<p>Second - registration for the Global Summit is officially open. You can find the <a href="https://creativecommons.net/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&id=9">registration form here</a>. The event is free, but places are limited, so early registration is essential if you want to ensure your place at this meeting of CC commmunity, board, staff, and key stakeholders interested in the present and future of the commons.</p>
<p>Finally, while we have you, we'd also like to remind you that the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2013/Call_for_Papers">call for papers</a> for the Summit closes this week. Have you papers in by 24 May if you want to be on the main program (lightning talks and unconference sessions can be submitted later).</p>
<p>See you all in Buenos Aires in August!</p>
