<p>Al Jazeera has just launched the latest of its online project called <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net">Al Jazeera Blogs</a>.</p>
<p>The website features blog posts written by prominent journalists and correspondents from the global Al Jazeera television network. It also hosts several sub-blogs sections divided by geographical areas, such as the <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/africa">Africa</a>, <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/asia">Asia</a>, <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/Americas">Americas</a>, <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/Europe">Europe</a>, and the <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east">Middle East</a>.  In addition, Al Jazeera has a blog focused <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.net/business">on international business and the ongoing financial crisis</a>.</p>
<p>The project also features interesting tech extras such as integration with <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">OpenCalais' semantic tagging system</a>.</p>
<p>Credit once again goes to Al Jazeera English's Head of Online, Mohamed Nanabhay. Mohamed also happens to be <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18213">the author of the first commoner letter for this year's annual campaign</a>, and was one of the key players who made <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazeera's amazing CC repository</a> a reality.</p>
