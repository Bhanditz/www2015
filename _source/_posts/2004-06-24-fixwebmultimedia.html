<p><a href="http://gonze.com/weblog/story/6-24-4">Lucas Gonze</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I am thinking is that we need a tech social movement to fix web multimedia by insisting that web standards be followed. REST was such a movement in the protocol space. The Zeldman-inspired movement to use structural HTML and CSS only did the same thing with design. This would be a direct analog for multimedia. Use real URLs that are not hidden behind javascript. Use correct mime types -- no making them up because you don't have time to look up the answer. Use standard data formats -- no proprietary types. Use correctly formatted playlists -- if you have a ram playlist, the extension must be .ram rather than .rm.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said. Creative Commons likes <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/">multimedia</a> and believes in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/usingmarkup">building on standards</a>. The web will benefit from this movement. Those interested in building a commons will benefit in particular. Trivial example: It can be a big pain to share and reuse content mediated by a maze of javascript. If you want your content to be shared and built upon, do <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">license it</a>, then follow Gonze's advice. One way to do this is to take advantage of the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a>'s ability to host Creative Commons licensed audio and video content.</p>
