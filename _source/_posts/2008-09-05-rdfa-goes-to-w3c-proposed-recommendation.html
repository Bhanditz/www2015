<p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2008#item151">RDFa reached Proposed Recommendation status</a> at the World Wide Web Consortium, the final stage before becoming a W3C Recommendation.</p>
<p>Using RDFa, one can make data in web pages rendered for humans also readable in a meaningful way by computers. This is important to Creative Commons, as we have always seen the promise of the Semantic Web to describe licenses and make works more findable and reusable, ironically it has always been difficult to bring the Semantic Web to the World Wide Web we're all used to using and loving. RDFa is a crucial bridge to bring these worlds together.</p>
<p>Creative Commons, primarily through the efforts of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#13">Ben Adida</a>, our W3C Representative (see a <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000595.html">recent interview with him at the Yahoo! Search Blog</a>), has been a major contributor to the development of RDFa since 2004. I strongly suspect the standard would have taken more than four years without CC's contributions.</p>
<p>You can read an in-depth description of some of the early CC use cases for RDFa in a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/d/d6/Ccrel-1.0.pdf">paper we released earlier this year</a>, including machine-readable attribution and description of images and other resources included in web pages.</p>
<p>CC's technology team, led by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#31">Nathan Yergler</a>, is also a leading implementer of RDFa, which is now used throughout <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org">our open source projects</a>, including our license chooser and license deeds.</p>
