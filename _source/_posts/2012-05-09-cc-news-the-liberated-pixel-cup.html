			<strong>The Liberated Pixel Cup: an epic contest for gaming freedom</strong></p>
<p>
			We&rsquo;re pleased to announce the launch of the Liberated Pixel Cup, a free-as-in-freedom game authoring competition being launched in cooperation between Creative Commons, the Free Software Foundation, Mozilla, and OpenGameArt! Liberated Pixel Cup is a two-part competition: make a bunch of awesome free culture licensed artwork, and program a bunch of free software games that use it. Hopefully many cool projects can come out of this&hellip; but that will only happen if people like you get involved! Technically the project will run in three phases.

		<strong>Reminder to enter the Why Open Education Matters video competition</strong></p>
<p>
			In March, Creative Commons, the U.S. Department of Education, and the Open Society Institute launched the Why Open Education Matters Video Competition. The goal of the competition is to raise awareness of Open Educational Resources (OER) and solicit short, creative videos that help explain what Open Educational Resources are and how they can be beneficial for teachers, students, and schools everywhere around the world. There&rsquo;s been lots of interest in the competition, and we wanted to remind you that the deadline to submit your video is <strong>June 5, 2012</strong>.
