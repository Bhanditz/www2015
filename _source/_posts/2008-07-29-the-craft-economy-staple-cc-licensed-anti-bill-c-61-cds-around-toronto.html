<p><a href="http://thecrafteconomy.com">The Craft Economy</a>, a Canadian band we have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7671">talked about before</a>, recently <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/28/candian-band-staples.html">got back in the news</a> in regards to their <a href="http://torontoist.com/2008/07/the_craft_economy_kill_bill_c61.php">latest CD-stapling adventure</a>. The band has taken to the streets of Toronto, stapling 150 packages that contain a CD of two CC licensed (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/ca/">BY-NC</a>) tracks as well as a message  regarding recent Canadian legislation on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_C-61">Bill C-61</a>. From <a href="http://thecrafteconomy.com/blog/?p=43">The Craft Economy blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Weâ€™re handing out / sending / posting a bunch of CDs this weekend, throughout Toronto and the Hillside Festival in Guelph, that have a demo of Menergy and The Crash, The Wagons, The Dying Horses on it (licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 2.5 license, to bring attention to Bill C-61 (and yeah, some upcoming shows, and yeah, our upcoming CD - but really, thatâ€™s a good thing).</p>
<p>We think fighting C-61 is important, and we think you should as well. Weâ€™ve posted this before, but do some research on this bill. Itâ€™s a mess [...] Bill C-61 is going to change the way you get to listen and watch the videos and music you pay for [...] The Craft Economy has licensed our music, including this CD, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 2.5 license. This license gives you the freedom to share our music with your friends and enemies, and remix and use it in new and creative ways, provided you attribute the work back to us, and you donâ€™t make money off our work. Itâ€™s fair for you and us. This is the way art should work.Please do more reading on C-61 at the following links. A fair and civil future relies upon us, and our action.</p></blockquote>
