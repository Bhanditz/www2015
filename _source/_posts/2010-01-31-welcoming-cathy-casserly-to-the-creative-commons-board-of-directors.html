<p>I'm pleased to announce that today the Creative Commons board of directors has elected Cathy Casserly as a new member. Cathy has been a foremost champion of the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement for a decade and of Creative Commons since its inception.</p>
<p>She served as Director of Open Educational Resources Initiative at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. A year ago she <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12453">joined</a> The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as Senior Partner.</p>
<p>Cathy has become a great personal friend and invaluable mentor as I ramp up my involvement in CC's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20329">open education strategy</a>. It is a great honor for me to welcome Cathy to the Creative Commons board of directors.</p>
