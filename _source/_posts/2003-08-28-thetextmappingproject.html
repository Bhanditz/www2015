<p><a href="http://www.textmapping.org/">The Textmapping Project</a> is a site aiming to improve reading comprehension by providing tutorials for teachers, homeschoolers, and education researchers. The practice of textmapping involves creating large scrolls containing information. Information presented in this way allows students to get an idea of the "big picture" and helps them figure out ways of gleaning relevant information and themes in a larger work, among many other <a href="http://www.textmapping.org/benefits.html">benefits</a>.</p>
<p>The site itself has a comprehensive copyright section explaining <a href="">how to use their content</a> and <a href="http://www.textmapping.org/copyright.html#properAttribution">how to give them proper attribution</a> in accordance with the Creative Commons license, and they even include the HTML that users can copy and paste to their documents.
