<p>Silicon-Valley-based NGO reinforces its activities around the globe and introduces its innovative copyright licenses in Slovenia.</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, USA and Berlin, GERMANY, Ljubljana SLOVENIA â€” October 28, 2005 â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon, will launch the localization of the innovative licensing system in Slovenia as part of a four day Festival of Creativity and Free Culture.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">groupâ€™s website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Project Lead Maja Bogataj JanÄiÄ, from the Intellectual Property Institute, and Å pela KuÄan of Ljubljana Digital Media Lab LJUDMILA, who supervised the technical team, to adapt the standardized licenses to Slovenian law.</p>
<p>The licenses will be launched as part of the Festival of Creativity and Free Culture in Ljubljana, which is honored to have the support of Dr. Janez DrnovÅ¡ek, the President of the Republic of Slovenia. The festival will include an international legal seminar, hosted by Open Society Institute, on October 28 during which Lawrence Lessig, Chairman & CEO of Creative Commons, will give a lecture titled â€œShould Copyright Include the Exclusive Right to Copy?â€ The lecture coincides with the promotion of the Slovenian translation of Lessigâ€™s book â€œFree Culture.â€</p>
<p>The localized version of CC licensing system will be unveiled at the CC Launch on Saturday October 29. The launch will consist of performances of world renown violinist Maja Cerar and the duet Random Logic, who will perform a piece by composer and computer musician Douglas Geers. Greersâ€™ pieice â€œObsessive Currentsâ€, which is CC licensed, was itself inspired by the public domain works of Bach and YsaÃ¿e. During the launch, the CC-licensed work of other local artists will also be showcased. Project leads from other Creative Commons teams in Brazil, Italy and Croatia will attend the launch together with Chairman & CEO Lawrence Lessig.</p>
