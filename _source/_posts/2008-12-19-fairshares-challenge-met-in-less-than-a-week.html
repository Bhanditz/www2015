<p>We're thrilled to announce that we've met <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11519">FairShare's matching challenge</a> -- and in less than a week, too! Thanks to everyone who took advantage of <a href="http://www.fairshare.cc/">FairShare's</a> generosity and doubled the value of their gift. Instead of raising $3000, we were able to raise $6000!</p>
<p>There are only 12 days left in the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">campaign</a> and the commons movement needs your help. You can make a difference in the fight for openness on the web today by <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">donating to Creative Commons</a>. </p>
