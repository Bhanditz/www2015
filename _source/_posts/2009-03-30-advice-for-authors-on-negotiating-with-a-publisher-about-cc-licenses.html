<p>Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/03/30/howto-sell-your-publ.html">points us</a> towards <a href="http://www.blog.digital-foundations.net/?p=53">an excellent essay</a> from the team behind <em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11880">Digital Foundations</a></em> on ten key steps to negotiating a CC-licensed release with a large scale publisher:</p>
<blockquote><p>4. Pitch it with facts</p>
<p>Use case studies to argue with facts. It also helps for them to see that other reputable publishers have licensed books Creative Commons. Oâ€™Reilly has some a study on an Asterisk book that we used very effectively.</p>
<p>http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/06/free_downloads.html</p>
<p>The Asterisk book sold 19k copies over two years (about what comparable books from Oâ€™Reilly were selling), but was downloaded 180,000 times from *one* of the 5 sites that mirrored it.</p>
<p>Also consider google as arbiter:</p>
<p>Results from google search breakdown of references to the two books in the oreilly case study (at the time of negotiation, early 2008):<br />
asterisk: 139,000 references in 2 years (2005-2007), or 70,000 per year</p>
<p>understanding the linux kernel, 42,000 references in 7 years (2000-2007), 6,000 per year</p>
<p>So there was 10x the press/blog/reference/hits for the CC licensed book.</p></blockquote>
<p>Treading the sometimes delicate waters of negotiating a CC license with those immediately apprehensive to the idea is difficult at the very least - this type of information, from those who have gone through the process, is invaluable. While the <em>Digital Foundations</em> piece focuses on print publishing, the information therein is applicable across media formats, especially when combined with our ever growing <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Casestudies">case study database</a>.</p>
<p>We would be remiss not to mention James Boyle's <a href="http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2008/11/28/questions-from-authors/">thoughts</a> on the matter, particularly regarding his experience in licensing <em><a href="http://www.thepublicdomain.org/">The Public Domain: Enclosing The Commons of the Mind</a></em> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>.</p>
