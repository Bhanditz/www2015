<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7549">we've mentioned before</a>, this Wednesday (July 11th) we will be back at <a href="http://shinesf.com/">Shine</a> for another round of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC Salon-ing</a>. The presenter list is shaping up nicely and it's bound to be a great time. This aside, we need your help in making it even better.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">slideshare.net</a> will not only be in attendance to present their phenomenal slide-sharing community, but will also run "PowerPoint Karaoke" (read about it <a href="http://heathervescent.blogs.com/heathervescent/2007/04/powerpoint_kara.html">here</a>), moderated by EFF's <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/#danny_obrien">Danny O'Brien</a>. To make it all work, we need your presentations! All you have to do is upload them to slideshare.net, CC licence them, make them downloadable, and finally tag them with "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tag/pptkaroake">pptkaroake</a>". Simple enough.</p>
<p>We can't wait to see what gets posted, and are even more eager to watch one another stumble through them at the Salon. See you then!</p>
