<p><em>Below is an invitation by members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open">WikiProject Open</a> to help improve two Wikipedia articles related to openness. Wikiproject Open is a collaboration with the <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open"><img src="img/wikiproject-open.001.png" alt="wikiproject open.001" width="556" height="154" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40109" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open">WikiProject Open</a> is a community of new and experienced Wikipedians, dedicated to improving Wikipedia's coverage of all things "open," and to using openly licensed content to improve Wikipedia articles in general. In celebration of Open Access Week, we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OPEN/COTW">invite you</a> to join us in improving two Wikipedia articles this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Access_Week">Open Access Week</a>: We should have plenty of new news coverage to draw from in improving this article</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license">Creative Commons license</a>: Let's make sure this central article is thorough and accurate; we will consider splitting off sub-articles, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those new to Wikipedia, you'll find some tips to get you started on our "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_welcome">welcome</a>" page.</p>
<p>Then, just get to work on the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Access_Week">Open Access Week</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license">Creative Commons license</a>" articles! Be sure to check each article's talk page (you'll find the tab in the upper left), because we'll surely be discussing what needs to be improved and how we want to approach it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OPEN/COTW">WikiProject Open's Collaboration of the Week</a> (COTW) gets underway.</p>
<p>Collaboration of the Week programs have been implemented by a number of wiki communities over the years. Academic studies have found them to be a highly effective way to keep people engaged and productive, in addition to building a sense of community. We hope you will join us as we launch this program, and help us improve Wikipedia's coverage of important topics in the world of openness!</p>
