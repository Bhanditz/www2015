<p>So it' s week three of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">CC Swag Photo Contest</a> and we openly acknowledge our excitement with the amount of participation! Even though we had some awesome entries this week, unfortunately we could only declare one winner.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fritztr/306597158/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="img/306597158_e4a9ae5ffe_m.jpg" width="240" height="167" alt="Creative Commons" /></a></center></p>
<p>Tim Fritz, photographer and CC supporter from the US has won week three of the CC swag photo contest with his photo "Creative Commons." Fritz illustrates CC's mission with his clever use of shallow depth of field. Who knew just one rubber band could say so much? Congrats Tim!</p>
<p>There are still 2 weeks to go, so please support CC and our mission of helping enable a participatory culture by using your photographic skills and innate creativity. </p>
