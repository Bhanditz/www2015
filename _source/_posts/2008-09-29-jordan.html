<h2>More about Abu-Ghazaleh Intellectual Property (AGIP)</h2>
<p>When <a href="http://www.agip.com/">Abu-Ghazaleh Intellectual Property (AGIP)</a> was established, as TMP Agents in 1972 in Kuwait, we knew that we were facing a considerable challenge. Intellectual property protection in the region was still in its early stages of development. However, since then we at Abu-Ghazaleh Intellectual Property have devoted our efforts to promoting the importance of IP protection throughout the Arab countries.</p>
<p>We have encouraged the introduction of IP laws and an efficient IP system that has introduced two significant changes to the region. Firstly, with the new legislation the major multinational corporations have been given the confidence to expand to the region because they are now assured of protection for their products. Secondly, the creative individuals of the Arab world such as Arab architects, artists, designers, computer scientists, musicians and writers, now have the protection for their products that ensures their hard work is properly rewarded.</p>
<p>As the years have passed we have been hugely successful in achieving the goals we initially set ourselves, and today we look around the region and are proud at the comprehensive developments that we have helped achieve in the field of IP.</p>
<p>One of our contributions, of which we take pride at AGIP, is our assistance and continued support provided to governmental committees and officials charged with revising and drafting new laws and regulations for the enforcement of intellectual property rights. Our participation in this field aims to ensure adequate methods of protection for intellectual property rights.</p>
