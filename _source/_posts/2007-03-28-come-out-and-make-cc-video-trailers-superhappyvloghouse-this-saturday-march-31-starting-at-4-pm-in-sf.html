<p>Jay Dedman e-mailed me the link to the kick-off of the annual <a href="http://superhappyvloghouse.pbwiki.com/SanFrancisco">Videoblogging Week called SuperHappyVlogHouse</a>. I'm leading a discussion about <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Blogger">Creative Commons and videoblogging</a> (help contribute to that <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Blogger">wiki page</a> too, prior ) with emphasis on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Podcasting_Legal_Guide">Podcasting Legal Guide</a> that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/alumni#36">Mia Garlick</a> and <a href="http://www.vogelelaw.com/index.html">Collete Vogele</a> created. Then, I'm going to set-up some ground rules about making video trailers, and then from 4-6 PM attendees are going to be making some nice video trailers/bumpers that may be used to show what CC license someone is using on their work and to give proper attribution. Check out the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/168359">upcoming.org post about this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>superhappyvloghouse is going to be a video making extravaganza!!! Come learn how to videoblog, or just collaborate on projects with other vloggers. check out the wiki! <a href="http://superhappyvloghouse.pbwiki.com/SanFrancisco">http://superhappyvloghouse.pbwiki.com/SanFrancisco</a><br />
Remember that this is the kick off of Videoblogging Week 2007 (<a href="http://videobloggingweek.pbwiki.com/">http://videobloggingweek.pbwiki.com/</a>) where people around the world make a video each day.</p>
<p>Here's the plan:</p>
<p>4-6pm: Discussion with the Creative Commons folks on why CC is important in Videoblogging. Tech aspects, legal aspects etc. If more videobloggers put a Creative Commons License at the end of all their videos, awareness grows as our videos move around the web. Independent creators unite!</p>
<p>6-9pm: We'll all make custom CC trailers that can be used in videos. Schlomo has a stop-animation table, lots of space at Hat Factory, great neighborhood for shooting. Anyone new can team up with an experienced videoblogger to learn how it's done. Lots of video nerds will be available to answer any question you've ever had. Bring your computer and camera...or use what we have.</p></blockquote>
<p>Come on out and plug into videoblogging!</p>
