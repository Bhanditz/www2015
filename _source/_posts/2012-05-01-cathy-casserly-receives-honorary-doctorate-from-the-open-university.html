<p>In March, Cathy, our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#catherinecasserly">CEO</a>, was recognized for her contributions to open education through an honorary doctorate awarded by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23521">The Open University</a>. The Open University is home to the <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/">OpenLearn</a> initiative, which makes available over 11,000 hours of structured learning via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> and has received over 20 million visitors. In addition to sustaining the largest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheOpenUniversity/">YouTube EDU presence</a> in Europe and <a href="http://www.open.edu/itunes/">iTunes U</a> downloads totaling over a quarter a million a week, The Open University also leads the <a href="http://www.tessafrica.net/">TESSA</a> project in Africa, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, which has delivered open educational resources to over a million teachers. </p>
<p>Professor <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/history/vincent.shtml">David Vincent</a> conferred the degree, with the following remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p>The proliferation of knowledge on the web has challenged traditional boundaries between formal<br />
and informal learning. Students have been quick to seize the opportunities, using their keyboards<br />
to explore the vast archives of information now available to them. Schools and universities, and<br />
the public bodies who fund them, have been much slower. It takes courage to abandon time-<br />
honoured means of owning and protecting the learning resources that they have created and paid<br />
for. Through her leadership at a number of key American foundations Cathy has played a critical<br />
role in challenging established thinking and promoting innovation.<br />
<br />
Her approach has been essentially collaborative. She has used donor income to stimulate change in<br />
educational bodies in the United States and around the world. After a PhD at Stanford and a spell in<br />
teaching, she has served as Director of the Open Educational Resources Initiative at The William and<br />
Flora Hewlett Foundation, Vice President and Senior Partner, Innovation and Open Networks at the<br />
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and is now Chief Executive Officer of Creative<br />
Commons, which is dedicated to providing the legal infrastructure for open resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats, Cathy! CC hopes to do more great work in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">open education</a> together.</p>
