<p>Today TED <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2008/06/50_million_tedt.php">announced</a> the 50 millionth view of a TED talk, marking its success since it first launched online two years ago in June of 2006. Â <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/">TED</a> stands for Technology, Entertainment, Design---and it features talks by various speakers from Bill Clinton to Bono. However, the most viewed talks are actually given by persons previously unknown. They are ideas "flying on [their] own merit[s]", says the executive producer of TED media according to <a href="http://blog.ted.com/">TEDBlog</a>. Almost half of TED's audience comes from outside the U.S., establishing TEDTalks as a global presence. TED Curator Chris Anderson says,</p>
<p>"TED's mission is to spread ideas, and we're now doing that on a scale that was unimaginable two years ago. It's clear there's an appetite out there for big ideas and meaningful stories."</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2008/06/counting_down_t.php">Top 10 TEDTalks</a> of all time; you'll be surprised by the speakers and their subjects, with number one titled, "My stroke of insight," by neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor.Â And while you're at it, check out Richard Baraniuk's "<a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/richard_baraniuk_on_open_source_learning.html">Goodbye, textbooks; hello, open-source learning</a>," a talk by the founder of <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a>, a leading educational platform in the OER movement.</p>
