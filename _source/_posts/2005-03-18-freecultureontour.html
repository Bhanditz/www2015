<p><a href="http://www.freeculturetour.org">Free Culture</a> may be visiting a college, youth media group, or festival near you.  Brooklyn-based artist Colin Mutchler, in partnership with <a href="http://freeculture.org">FreeCulture.org</a>, has launched a five-week tour which kicked off last week at <a href="http://sxsw.com">South by Southwest</a>.</p>
<p>
The Free Culture show mixes music, images, and spoken word to demonstrate the complex and entertaining cross section between cultural property and freedom. Check it out!</p>
