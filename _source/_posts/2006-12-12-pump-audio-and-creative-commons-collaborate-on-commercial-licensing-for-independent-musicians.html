<p><strong>PUMP AUDIO AND CREATIVE COMMONS COLLABORATE ON COMMERCIAL LICENSING FOR INDEPENDENT MUSICIANS </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hudson Valley, NY and San Francisco, CA â€“ December 12, 2006</strong> â€“ Pump Audio, the leading provider of quality independent music to content creators globally,  today announced that it has teamed up with Creative Commons to expand and promote fair commercial licensing options for artists worldwide. Pump Audio is offering a variety of Creative Commons copyright licenses to its independent musicians who want to allow various forms of non-commercial use of their music.</p>
<p>â€œCreative Commons and Pump Audio share a common goal of giving artists the freedom to license their creative works as they see fit,â€ said Steve Ellis, founder and CEO of Pump Audio. â€œPump Audio is all about giving independent musicians a<br />
fair deal by connecting them with the producers in TV, advertising, and the Web who are clamoring for original and legal music to accompany their creations. By working with Creative Commons, we can provide even more independent musicians with greater commercial licensing options for their music.â€</p>
<p>As part of the collaboration, Pump Audio has introduced an online badge for artists, allowing them to designate on any Web page, artist blog, or MySpace profile that their music is available for commercial licensing through Pump Audio. Artists can pair their new Pump Audio badges with similar badges for their Creative Commons copyright licenses, enabling them to promote both their commercial and non-commercial licensing preferences. (Examples can be found at <a href="http://www.lovetheory.com/listenbuy.html">lovetheory.com/listenbuy.html</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/garynewvision">myspace.com/garynewvision</a>).</p>
<p>â€œThe goal of Creative Commons is to provide authors and artists with easy ways to mark their creative work with the freedom they intend it to carry,â€ said Lawrence Lessig, Creative Commonsâ€™ CEO. â€œWeâ€™re incredibly excited to work with Pump Audio to offer independent musicians a fair and innovative licensing option for the commercial use of their music in both traditional and online media.â€</p>
<p>Under Pump Audioâ€™s artist-friendly system, licensing revenues are split equally with musicians, and the artists retain complete ownership over their music.  Pump Audio helps independent musicians license their music to traditional producers in TV, advertising and interactive media through the PumpBox, its advanced search software and delivery system, as well as to content creators of all types through Pump Audio's Soundtrack service on the Web. Pump Audioâ€™s production customers include MTV Networks, NBC Studios, HBO, New Line Cinema and advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditions â€” to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€ â€” thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>

<p><strong>About Creative Commons </strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licences provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various organizations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as members of the public.
