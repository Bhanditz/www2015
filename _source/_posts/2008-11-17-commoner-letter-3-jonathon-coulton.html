<p>To our community - for our next commoner letter we are featuring an<br />
artist who has really proven that the CC model works for musicians.<br />
Jonathan Coulton has made a career out of sharing his music with his<br />
fans, not just aurally, but digitally and meaningfully through the<br />
prolific use of our licenses. We've also worked with Jonathan this<br />
year to offer an exciting new CC item -- a custom USB jump drive<br />
stocked with his music and source tracks. Read on for his heartfelt<br />
commoner letter and for more information about our new jump drives.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Dear Creative Commoner:</p>
<p>I first learned about Creative Commons when I heard Lawrence Lessig<br />
speak at a conference in 2004. I had been invited there to sing a<br />
silly song about the future, revenge, and robot armies to an audience<br />
of futurists and super scientists. It was a little intimidating - I<br />
was not even Internet Famous then. I was still working at my day job,<br />
trying to figure out how a career software guy in his mid 30s could<br />
ever find a way to make a living writing songs. Lessig gave his<br />
standard presentation (to this day, still the most delicious<br />
Powerpoint kung fu I have ever seen) explaining the history of<br />
copyright and the goals of Creative Commons. As we all filed out for<br />
lunch, I remember feeling like my head was on fire, it was just the<br />
most exciting idea I had ever heard.</p>
<p>In those days one of the things that was keeping me from doing music<br />
full time was my lack of a coherent plan: I make music, something<br />
happens, I make money, that was about as far as I could think it<br />
through. Creative Commons filled in a lot of the gaps for me. I knew<br />
about the internet of course, I was aware of the rise of remix<br />
culture, file sharing, and fan-created content. But there was<br />
something so compelling about the Creative Commons license, the idea<br />
that you could attach it to a piece of art you had made and declare<br />
your intentions - please, share my music, put it in a remix, make it<br />
into a music video. I was thrilled and emboldened by the idea that I<br />
could give my songs legs, so that they could walk around the world and<br />
find their way into places I would never dream of sending them. I<br />
immediately started licensing my songs with CC, and a year later I<br />
quit my job to create music full time.</p>
<p>It's hard to overstate the degree to which CC has contributed to my<br />
career as a musician. In 2005 I started Thing a Week, a project in<br />
which I recorded a new song every week and released it for free on my<br />
website and in a podcast feed, licensing everything with Creative<br />
Commons. Over the course of that year, my growing audience started to<br />
feed back to me things they had created based on my music: videos,<br />
artwork, remixes, card games, coloring books. I long ago lost track of<br />
this torrent of fan-made stuff, and of course I'll never know how many<br />
people simply shared my music with friends, but there's no question in<br />
my mind that Creative Commons is a big part of why I'm now able to<br />
make a living this way. Indeed, it's where much of my audience comes<br />
from - there are some fan-made music videos on YouTube that have been<br />
viewed millions of times. That's an enormous amount of exposure to new<br />
potential fans, and it costs me exactly zero dollars.</p>
<p>When you're an artist, it's a wonderful thing to hear from a fan who<br />
likes what you do. But it's even more thrilling to see that someone<br />
was moved enough to make something brand new based on it - that your<br />
creative work has inspired someone to do more creative work, that your<br />
little song had a child and that child was a YouTube video that a<br />
million people watched. A Creative Commons license is like a joy<br />
multiplier. The art you create adds to the world whenever someone<br />
appreciates it, but you also get karma credit for every new piece of<br />
art it inspires. And around and around. This is my favorite thing<br />
about Creative Commons: the act of creation becomes not the end, but<br />
the beginning of a creative process that links complete strangers<br />
together in collaboration. To me it's a deeply satisfying and<br />
beautiful vision of what art and culture can be.</p>
<p>This is why I've chosen to release a greatest hits album of my<br />
Thing-A-Week songs to help support Creative Commons' 2008 campaign.<br />
We've teamed up to combine not only the unreleased "JoCo Looks Back"<br />
album, but all of the unmixed audio tracks for all of the 20 songs on<br />
a custom CC green 1gb jump drive. The drives, whose entire contents<br />
are licensed under CC's BY-NC-SA license, will be available<br />
exclusively through Creative Commons' support site until December<br />
31st, and you can get one today when you donate $50 and above.</p>
