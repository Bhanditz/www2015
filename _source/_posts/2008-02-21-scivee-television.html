<p>Since <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/" title="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science Commons</a> blogged about SciVee last August, the "YouTube for science research" has expanded. If you haven't already, check out this science television for adults.  It's not your typical science programming--you won't see Bill Nye the Science Guy here--but you could definitely learn a thing or two on this site promoting open science research.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scivee.tv/" title="http://www.scivee.tv/">SciVee Television</a> fosters networking between science professionals, or anyone that wants to share their research.  You can create "pubcasts" by presenting your published scientific article in a video. The goal is to improve your research by sharing your research--a novel concept?</p>
