<p>The <a href="http://p2pu.org/">Peer 2 Peer University</a>, more commonly known now as P2PU by a growing community of self-learners, educators, journalists, and web developers, <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2010/08/26/sign-up-opens/">launches</a> its third round of courses today, opening sign-ups for "courses dealing in subject areas ranging from Collaborative Lesson Planning to Manifestations of Human Trafficking."</p>
<p>P2PU is simultaneously launching its <a href="http://p2pu.org/p2pu-school-webcraft-september-2010-courses">School of Webcraft</a>, which is a collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation and "is a powerful new way to learn open, standards based web development in a collaborative environment. School of Webcraft courses include Beginning Python Webservices and HTML5." </p>
<p>In addition, Creative Commons Counsel Lila Bailey is co-facilitating the <a href="http://p2pu.org/general/copyright-4-educators-us">Copyright for Educators course</a> this round, which will focus on United States law. The course is "for educators who want to learn about copyright, open content material and licensing" and "is taught around practical case studies faced by teachers when using copyright material in their day to day teaching and educational instruction." For more information, see the <a href="http://p2pu.org/general/copyright-4-educators-us">course page</a>. </p>
<p>Sign-ups for all other courses are available at <a href="http://p2pu.org/course/list">http://p2pu.org/course/list</a>. The deadline to sign up is September 8, and courses will run until October 27th. All courses are free to take and openly licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>.
