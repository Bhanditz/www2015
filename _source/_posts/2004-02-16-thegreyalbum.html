<p>A few months ago, hip-hop artist Jay Z released what is reportedly his last album, titled <a href="http://www.hiphopmusic.com/archives/000214.html">The Black Album</a>. He also released a vocals-only version, specifically for DJs to incorporate into new mixes. One of those mixes was done by <a href="http://djdangermouse.com/">DJ Dangermouse</a>, using only samples from The Beatles' White Album. This new mix was dubbed The Grey Album and a limited pressing was made. After <a href="http://newyorker.com/talk/content/?040209ta_talk_greenman">a mention in the New Yorker</a>, copies quickly <a href="http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html">showed up online</a> and spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>EMI, the rights holders to The Beatles' recordings issued a cease and desist order to record stores and online merchants selling it last week, since the sampling was done without permission from either Jay Z or The Beatles. Executive Director of the Creative Commons, Glenn Otis Brown was quoted in <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,62276,00.html">a Wired News piece about the album</a> and points out the problems of copyright being used to silence DJ Dangermouse and his popular mix.</p>
