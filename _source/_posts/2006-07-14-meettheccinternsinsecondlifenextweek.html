<p>So we have four fabulous interns this summer - <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#59">Amy</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#58">Katy</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#61">Margot</a> & <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#60">Asheesh</a>.  They have all been working closely with the CC team about the various projects that we have in the office right now and have been busily exploring <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> & getting to know their SL selves.  Here are some photos of them  in world (looking a little like a virtual boy band, I must confess)...</p>

<p>As Jen <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5979">posted</a> yesterday, the CC interns are going to be in Second Life next Thursday, July 20 at 4pm PDT at our HQ on <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Kula%204/46/92/26/">Kula Island</a>, talking about what they have been working on this summer.  If this is how crazy their virtual selves are - can't wait for the discussions!</p>
