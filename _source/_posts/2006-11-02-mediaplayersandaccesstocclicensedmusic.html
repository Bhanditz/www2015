<p>Last year the Linux media player <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarok_%28audio%29">Amarok</a> created a demo <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5306">LiveCD using CC licensed music from the WIRED CD</a>. In the meantime Amarok developers have added many features and have now <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/11/amarok_adds_mag.html">added access to Magnatune within the player</a>. (We've mentioned Magnatune here many times, but for new readers, it is an innovative record label that uses CC licensing, see our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/magnatune">interview with the founder</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird_%28software%29">Songbird</a> is another innovative media player, and one that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux. It includes access to CC Search via a sidebar and can "play" any web page with music links.  The screenshot below shows Songbird playing recent remixes on <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/11/amarok_adds_mag.html">Amarok post on the Magnatune blog</a> for screenshots of that integration.</p>
