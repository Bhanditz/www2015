<h2>About The Center for Media Research and Education (MOKK)</h2>
<p>The Center for Media Research and Education (MOKK) was founded in 2002 as a joint effort of the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Budapest University of Technologyand Economics and the leading Hungarian telco, Hungarian Telecom with the aim of furthering multi-disciplinary research and education in the field of new media in Hungary. MOKK's teaching and research staff comes from very different academic backgrounds - such as economics, urban sociology, media studies, cultural studies, computer science, cognitive sciences and linguistics - but share an interest in new media technologies.</p>
<p>MOKK is built around the conviction that it is impossible to understand the sociocultural effects of new technologies without taking into account their technical foundations and attributes; and conversely, in order to develop succesful new media applications one needs to understand the sociocultural context of their use.</p>
<p>MOKK is involved in several on-going R&amp;D projects such as the National Digital Archive; SzÃ³szablya (Wordchopper), an open source morphological analysis application for the Hungarian language; Hunglish, an open source mechanical statistical translator application (Hungarian-English; English-Hungarian); and Agyfarm (Brainfarm), an integrated on-line group-work, publication and communication platfrorm for Hungarian academic researchers.</p>
