<p>Creative Commons dedicates the text of its legal tools to the public domain using the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" title="CC0 Public Domain Dedication">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>. While that doesnâ€™t mean that everything possible is allowed, we believe that copyright isnâ€™t the right tool for everything someone creates, and we donâ€™t think it is the right tool here. </p>
<p>CC has never asserted copyright in the text of our licenses or other legal tools, and we made our policy clearer last year by declaring that they are released using CC0. The text of the licenses, public domain tools, and license deeds CC publishes are all unrestricted by copyright worldwide. </p>
<p><strong>No copyright â‰  no rules</strong></p>
<p>Although these materials are public domain, the Creative Commons name and logo are trademarks of the organization and may only be used according to our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies#trademark" title="trademark policy">trademark policy</a>. </p>
<p>This can be a difficult thing to communicate: while we want people to freely reuse our work, we donâ€™t want to give people the wrong idea about what they can do, and the difference between copyright and trademark can be complicated. </p>
<p>Weâ€™ve tried to make our trademark policy simple, and enforce it when necessary without overreaching. Basically,  we want to make sure that people arenâ€™t confused about what comes from Creative Commons and what doesnâ€™t, and that others arenâ€™t associating CC with things we didnâ€™t do. While we hope itâ€™s simple enough not to need much description, if you want to reuse CC materials in a way that uses our name and logo, please see our trademark policy to be sure youâ€™re in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>Credit where credit is due </strong></p>
<p>We appreciate credit for our work! We just don't require it through copyright.</p>
<p>Even though CC0 imposes no legal obligation to provide attribution, courtesy, good practice, norms, and expectations may mean that you should give credit anyway. (For example, we recommend <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data" title="CC0 data use cases">CC0 for scientific data</a>, but many reusers always include source information, both to acknowledge othersâ€™ work and to establish the dataâ€™s provenance.) Giving proper credit helps others know where the text came from so that they can find out more about it. But we recognize that sometimes itâ€™s undesirable or impractical to include a credit, and you won't be infringing our copyright if you don't.</p>

<p><strong>(Trade)mark our words...</strong></p>
<p>We <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Modifying_the_CC_licenses" title="Modifying the CC licenses">recommend against modifying the licenses</a>, and any changes to the text mean that you may not call the result a CC license. You are free to link to us, talk about us, cite us, and yes, criticize us by name without infringing, but you may not use or associate our name with a license of your own.</p>
<p>Our trademark rights address what we care about: not confusing people into thinking something is a CC license when it isnâ€™t. </p>
<p><strong>What about license proliferation?</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons provides a standard set of licenses suitable to a wide variety of uses and situations, reducing the need for custom licenses. By doing this, CC prevents license proliferation, which threatens the commons by enabling the creation of separate pools of incompatible material. </p>
<p>Though not everyone wants to adopt a CC license, we can't resolve those differences by using copyright to restrict modifications on the license text itself. Many other licenses already exist for those who wish to choose other terms. CC encourages potential adopters to consider using our standard licenses, which have a long history and a thriving user base, rather than creating new, incompatible modified versions. A license that is modified cannot be called a CC license, so while someone may create a new license based on our text, the risk of confusion or mistaken adoption is lowered. </p>
<p><strong>Your turn?</strong></p>
<p>We believe in creating a vibrant commons, and so we think it makes sense to dedicate our legal tools to the public domain so they can be copied, shared, and reused without restriction. We hope you will consider joining us in <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/" title="CC0 chooser">using CC0</a> for your own materials! </p>
