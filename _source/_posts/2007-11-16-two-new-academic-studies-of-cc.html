<p>In what <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7701">seems to becoming a trend</a>, two new academic papers have been made available online that explore the varying implications of Creative Commons in relation to copyright law and culture at large.</p>
<p>The first paper, <a href="http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/kim.html">The Creative Commons and Copyright Protection in the Digital Era: Uses of Creative Commons Licenses</a> by Minjeong Kim, examines CC licensors by using a "mixed-methods approach involving a web-based survey of CC licensors, a content analysis of CC-licensed works, and interviews - the study characterizes CC licensors, the ways that CC licensors produce creative works, the private interests that CC licenses serve, and the public interests that CC licenses serve."</p>
<p>The second paper (forthcoming), <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=1029366 ">License or a Contract, Analyzing the Nature of Creative Commons Licenses</a> by Herkko Hietanen, focuses on the functional nature of CC licenses, attempting to understand "how the licenses should be interpreted, enforced and what the potential remedies are that might exist if a licensee fails to comply with the terms of the license".</p>
