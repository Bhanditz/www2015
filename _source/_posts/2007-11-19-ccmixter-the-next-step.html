<p>We're thinking about how to take our music remix site, <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>, to the next level. <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2007/11/ccmixter_thinking_about_where.html">Read about it at the Lessig blog</a>. If you're logged into ccMixter, you can <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/survey">go here</a> to take a survey on the matter.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with ccMixter, check out the unofficial <a href="http://ccmixterblog.blogspot.com/">ccMixterblog</a>, which has tons of great examples of ccMixter reuse and collaboration, and some well-deserved <a href="http://ccmixterblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/editors-picks.html">self-congratulation</a> (or go straight to the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/editorial/picks">Editor's Picks</a>).</p>
<p>An affordance that keeps the ccMixter community focused is that no fully-mixed uploads are allowed, unless they reuse material already on ccMixter.</p>
<p>Now for the (post) title cut: <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/copyrightcriminals/trifonic/copyrightcriminals_-_trifonic_-_The_Next_Step.mp3">The Next Step</a> by <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/trifonic/4163">Trifonic</a>, licensed under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">BY-NC</a>.</p>
