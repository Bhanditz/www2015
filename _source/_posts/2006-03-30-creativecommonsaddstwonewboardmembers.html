<p>San Francisco, USA â€” March 30, 2006</p>
<p>Creative Commons is pleased to announce the addition of two new members to its Board of Directors â€” Jimmy Wales and Laurie Racine.</p>
<p>Jimmy Wales is the founder and President of the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit corporation which operates Wikipedia, the volunteer-created, multi-lingual, Web-based, free-content encyclopedia, in addition to the co-founder and chairman of Wikia, Inc., the for-profit corporation which operates Wikia.com, a broader set of collaborative communities.</p>
<p>Laurie Racine works with for-profits and not for profit enterprises that are concerned with the future of creativity in the digital age.  She was President of the Center for the Public Domain and is Chair and co-founder of Public Knowledge.</p>
<p>Lawrence Lessig, Creative Commonsâ€™ CEO & Chairman of the Board said â€œJimmy brings to Creative Commons his indepth knowledge about the issues arising from collaborative, freely licensed projects and Laurie brings her extensive managerial experience in the creative and technology communities.  Both are valuable complements that enhance the existing expertise of the Creative Commons' Board members.â€</p>
<p>About Creative Commons</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licences provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various foundations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Omidyar Network Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as members of the public.
