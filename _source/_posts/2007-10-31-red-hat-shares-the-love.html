<p>Red Hat is now offering an <a href="https://www.redhat.com/training/specials/dogood.html">opportunity</a> to learn more about  Linux and support CC at the same time! If you sign up for a Red Hat Linux course eligible for a promotional giveaway, you can waive that giveaway in exchange for a donation to CC.  Thank you Red Hat for promoting sharing in so many ways.</p>
