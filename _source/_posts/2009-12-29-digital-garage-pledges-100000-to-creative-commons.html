<p><a href="http://www.garage.co.jp/en/">Digital Garage</a> has just pledged $100,000 to support Creative Commons' work in 2010. Digital Garage has been a key corporate funder of Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6160">since 2006</a> and we're thrilled to continue having their support.</p>
<p>Digital Garage CEO Kaoru Hayashi <a href="http://www.garage.co.jp/en/corporate/messages.html">explains their mission</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital Garage was founded so we could contribute to the building of a better society by creating the Internet contexts for â€œreal spaceâ€ and ever-expanding â€œcyber space,â€ as well as by connecting Japan with countries overseas, marketing with technology and the present with the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Creative Commons is a key piece that helps enable their mission, and we're proud to continue working with Digital Garage and other innovative companies who value collaboration and creativity.</p>
<p>With Digital Garage's help, as of this moment we need to raise $105,245 of our $500,000 goal for this year's campaign. That gap will get smaller by the moment -- but only if you help. Please join Digital Garage and the thousands of people and organizations investing in the future of creativity and knowledge by <b><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donating to Creative Commons today!</a></b></p>
