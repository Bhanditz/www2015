<p>This week marks <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/19346">Creative Commonsâ€™ 7th birthday</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is helping us celebrate by generously matching all donations made to our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">annual fundraising campaign</a> for the next week, up to $3,000. Even if you've already contributed, <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">give whatever you can</a></strong> today - Twitter will match your donation so that it goes twice as far towards supporting CC.</p>
<p>Creative Commons uses Twitter to engage directly and efficiently with people worldwide who care about participatory culture and the innovation and social good that come from it. Twitter provides a valuable way for nonprofits like us to give and get feedback, promote projects, and announce milestones. If youâ€™re not one of the more than 240,000 people already following us on Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/creativecommons">visit our page</a> and become one! It's a simple way to stay up to date with all things CC.</p>
<p>Here's another way to support Creative Commons during its birthday week: When you tweet this week, include the hashtag #cc and link to our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">support page</a>, to let your community know that you value the work Creative Commons does:</p>

<p>We need everyoneâ€™s contribution in this final push for our 2009 annual campaign, so please <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate today</a></strong>!</p>
