<p>This in from CC pal <a href="http://www.fredbenenson.com/">Fred Benenson</a>, current CC Salon NYC organizer:</p>
<p>New York City's next Creative Commons Salon is Friday November 17th, 6:30pm at <a href="http://www.fontanasnyc.com/">Fontana's</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&q=Fontana%27s+Bar&near=new+york+city&ie=UTF8&dtab=0&ei=FxHpRNWdNoHqsQHsrqXQCw&cid=40714167,-74006389,13149917605501535099&li=lmd&ll=40.717887,-73.992104&spn=0.044627,0.062828&om=1">105 Eldridge St.</a> between Broome and Grand in the Lower East Side). This salon features Megan Miller from <a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/">PopSci.com</a> who will be discussing and presenting <i>Popular Science</i>'s recent foray into the digital world known as Second Life. Tim Schwartz from the <a href="http://www.movingimage.us/">Museum of the Moving Image</a> will also be joining us and discussing the recent projects and digital exhibitions at his museum.</p>
<p>So drop by on Friday for some cheap drinks, and come ready to talk about the Commons in NYC. This is the last salon of the year, as our December salon is combined with a special birthday party for Creative Commons on Friday, December 15th.</p>
