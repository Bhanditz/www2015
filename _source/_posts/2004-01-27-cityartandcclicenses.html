Over at the blog "A Month Full Of Wednesdays" <a href="http://amfow.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_amfow_archive.html#107440322009007354">I noticed a post</a> describing a recent Minneapolis <a href="http://www.janetzweig.com/public/CallForEntries.html">call for music and video to play in stations</a> and a <a href="http://www.euclidtransit.org/public_art/default.asp">recent call for artwork</a> for Cleveland's public transit. The post mentions an idea to extend Cleveland art requests to include audio for use in stations and the transit authority's hold system.</p>
<p>The author mentions that Creative Commons licenses would be a good idea to level the playing field and allow the municipal companies to share the music with others on their site freely. We can't help but agree; these projects calling for artwork, music, and video for public transportation ask creators to contribute their work for the good of the community, much like our licenses do for the good of a greater culture.</p>
