<p>San Francisco, USA, June 21, 2005:</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible<br />
copyright licenses for authors and artists, released today its long-<br />
awaited present to the Free Culture Movement, represented primarily<br />
by FreeCulture.org, which celebrated its first birthday on April 23,<br />
2005. The present is a recording of "Happy Birthday to You" by some<br />
of the 'leaders of the free world'--meaning some of the leaders in the<br />
free culture, free software and open source software movements. The<br />
present is now offered to the world from Creative Commons' site in<br />
exchange for donations to pay the licensing fees of 8.5 cents per<br />
download, with the rest of the donations going to support the Free<br />
Culture Movement.</p>
<p>The Free Culture Movement was formed at Swarthmore College,<br />
Swarthmore, PA, by more than 100 students. These students were<br />
organized by a group who sued Diebold and won, after Diebold sent a<br />
cease and desist letter to the Swarthmore university administrator<br />
alleging violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Faced<br />
with such grave accusations, the university administrator shut down<br />
the students' website--that is, until they won the right to have it<br />
reinstated. A year later, there are nine chapters across the country,<br />
and more brewing around the world.</p>
<p>In keeping with tradition, Creative Commons wanted to sing "Happy<br />
Birthday" to the Free Culture Movement and help the Free Culture<br />
Movement on its way with donations by those supportive of its cause.<br />
Because "Happy Birthday" is still under copyright, however, to do so,<br />
Creative Commons needed to get a license.</p>
<p>The American Composers, Authors and Publishers directed Creative<br />
Commons--because it wished to only make a single download--to Warner<br />
Chappell Music. Warner, after discussing license terms and quoting an<br />
applicable license fee, refused to grant a license and directed<br />
Creative Commons to Harry Fox. Finally, through Harry Fox, Creative<br />
Commons was able to obtain a license and sing "Happy Birthday" in<br />
public to the Free Culture Movement, somewhat belatedly given the<br />
delay in securing the necessary rights.</p>
<p>The song is now available for download and donations are welcome to<br />
help cover the licensing fees and to assist the Free Culture Movement<br />

song are the designated 'leaders of the free world'--The Staff of<br />
EFF", Mitch Kapor, Dan Gillmor, Brian Behlendorf, Ian Clarke, Jimmy<br />
Wales, Brewster Kahle, and Gigi Sohn.</p>
