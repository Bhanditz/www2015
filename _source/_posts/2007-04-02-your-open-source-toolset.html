<p>Last fall we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6157">mentioned</a> a great post by Wikipedia leader (and now  CC board member) Jimmy Wales on why <a href="http://blog.jimmywales.com/index.php/archives/2004/10/21/free-knowledge-requires-free-software-and-free-file-formats/">free knowledge requires free software and free file formats</a>.</p>
<p>Now Wikipedian Erik MÃ¶ller weighs in with a practical post on <a href="http://intelligentdesigns.net/blog/?p=53">Wikimedia's open source toolset</a>, which may be seen as a paean to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Toolset">open source media creation software</a> generally (Wikipedia leading the way).</p>
<p>Erik specifically calls out <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, a drawing application with contributions from now CC employee Jon Phillips (his open source contributions were <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6158">crucial to getting a job here</a>).</p>
<p>Inkscape also happens to have a built-in feature enabling CC licensing of drawings, something <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Content_Creation_Applications">we hope to see in many more content creation applications</a>.</p>
