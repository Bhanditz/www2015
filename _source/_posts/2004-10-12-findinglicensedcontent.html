<p>If you can't be bothered to open up your web browser and head over to <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org">our search engine</a>, but still have a hankering for licensed content, there's good news.  Well, good news if you run Mac OS X.  We now have a Creative Commons Search channel for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/sherlock/">Sherlock</a></p>
<div align="center">
<a href="http://drop.creativecommons.org/sherlock/screenshots/ccsherlock.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/ccsherlock_thumb.png" border="0" /></a>
</div>
<p>You can connect to the channel at <a href="sherlock://drop.creativecommons.org/sherlock/ccsearch.xml">sherlock://drop.creativecommons.org/sherlock/ccsearch.xml</a>. It still has some rough edges, and there's definitely room for improvement.  If you're interested in helping, the code is available at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cctools">CC Tools</a> SourceForge project.  Give it a try, and let me know what you think.</p>
