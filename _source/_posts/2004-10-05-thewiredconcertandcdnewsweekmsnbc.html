<p>Another great <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6186259/site/newsweek/">article</a> on the WIRED CD and Concert, this one from Newsweek/MSNBC.</p>
<p>The piece features great quotes from the bands <a href="http://spoontheband.com">Spoon</a> and <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/matmos/">Matmos</a>, who happen to be two of my favorites, two of the WIRED CD contributors, and nice fellows to boot.</p>
