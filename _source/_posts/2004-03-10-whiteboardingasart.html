<p>I'm at the <a href="http://www.iftf.org/">Institute for the Future</a> today for the Future of Cooperation Expert Colloqium. (I'm in favor of the future, and cooperation, as it happens, so it's a good fit.)</p>
<p>One of the many interesting things I've learned about today is "visual journalism," which you could also call "whiteboarding for posterity." Eileen Clegg, who is memorializing this meeting with visual journalism, told me about <a href="http://almaden.ibm.com/coevolution/gallery.shtml">a series</a> of brainstorm-murals she created to sum up a big-thinkers symposium at IBM this fall. The images are all CC-licensed, right there on <a href="http://almaden.ibm.com/coevolution/gallery.shtml">the IBM website</a>. Check out <a href="http://almaden.ibm.com/coevolution/images/visualjournal/index.shtml?image01">the mural</a> that resulted from a session led by Berkeley's <a href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hal/">Hal Varian</a>.</p>
