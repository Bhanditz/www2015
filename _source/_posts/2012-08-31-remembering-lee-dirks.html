<p><img src="img/leedirks.jpg" width="200" height="250" style="float:right;padding-left: 10px" />Two years ago, I was trying to organize my first Creative Commons-sponsored event, a joint CC-USGS workshop titled <a href="http://punkish.org/geoweb/index.html">Law and the GeoWeb</a>. I ran into Lee in the keynote room at the <a href="http://www.codata2010.com">CODATA</a> conference in Cape Town and asked him to suggest a speaker from Microsoft. Lee said he would do better&#160;&#8212; he would host the entire workshop at his digs at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA. Several conversations and emails later the workshop was made possible with generous provision of the facilities, food, and transportation, and the entire workshop was also <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=147570">taped and archived for posterity</a>, all because of Lee&#8217;s spontaneous offer. At one point I asked him, &#8220;Why?&#8221; Lee replied that that&#8217;s what he did, he worked to promote conversations on free and open access to science. That is simply what Lee did.</p>
<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/ldirks/">Lee Dirks</a> and his wife Judy <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/08/29/2-americans-peruvian-die-in-peru-highway-accident/">died this week in a car accident</a> in Peru. The scientific and education community engaged in open access lost a champion and a friend.</p>
