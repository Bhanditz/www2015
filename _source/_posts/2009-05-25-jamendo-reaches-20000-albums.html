<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://blog.jamendo.com/2009/05/25/20000-albums-we-can-hardly-believe-it/">Jamendo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>20,000 albums? We can hardly believe it!</strong></p>
<p>Well, it seems&nbsp;like&nbsp;just a few months ago we were celebrating 10,000 albums published on jamendo&nbsp;and this weekend we passed the <strong>20,000 album mark</strong>!</p>
<p>Actually, it was&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.jamendo.com/2008/06/18/10-000-albums-on-jamendo/">11 months ago</a>&nbsp;to be precise.&nbsp;Look at it this way and youâ€™ll understand why weâ€™re the first to be impressed with the figures: it will have taken jamendo 3 years to gather 10,000 albums, and then just under one year later, that number has doubled!</p>
<p>Itâ€™s pretty safe to say weâ€™re going strong. And even safer to say itâ€™s all thanks to you: artists, members and everyone contributing to spread the word of free music!</p>

<p>You can see those 20,000 albums broken down by license at <a href="http://jamendo.com/creativecommons">jamendo.com/creativecommons</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of "we can hardly believe it" and collections of CC licensed media, I recently noticed a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5425">post on this blog from 2005</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Weâ€™re also happy to see growth at Flickr has gone way beyond our expectations to nearly 1.5 million photos licensed for reuse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two months ago Flickr reached <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13588">100 million CC licensed photos</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Jamendo and may today's surprise only hint at an astounding future.</p>
