<p>Last December, when ccLearn issued its <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/what-status-for-open">report</a> to the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, Creative Commons Netherlands published its own entitled, "<a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/publicaties/Pages/Reuseofmaterial.aspx">Reuse of material in the context of education and research</a>." However, the report was only available in Dutch until recently. Now, thanks to Paul Keller (Creative Commons Nederland) and Wilma Mossink (SURF), the English version of the report is online. It recommends the most open Creative Commons license, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/deed.en">Attribution Only</a>, for reuse of material in the context of education and research. From the original <a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/publicaties/Pages/Reuseofmaterial.aspx">announcement</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"The rise of the Internet and other new ICT tools have led to drastic changes in the options for distribution and reuse. These changes demand a reorientation in the rules for sharing educational and research materials.</p>
<p>Since sharing educational and research materials is high on the agenda of Dutch higher education and research institutions, SURFdirect and Creative Commons examined the different Open Content licences that are available and that will make clear to reusers what they are permitted to do with material held in repositories. </p>
<p>SURFdirect has indicated that the choice of licence must not create barriers to the future use of educational and research material, that it can be applied at both research universities and universities of applied sciences [hogescholen], and that this can in fact be done in 80% of cases, this report recommends using the most liberal Creative Commons licence for textual output...</p>
<p>Another important recommendation in this report is that SURF should set up an effective awareness-raising campaign in order to introduce and explain Creative Commons licences to those â€˜in the fieldâ€™."</p></blockquote>
<p>The report itself is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/deed.en">CC BY</a>, and you can download the report as an <a href="http://www.surffoundation.nl/en/publicaties/Pages/Reuseofmaterial.aspx">openly editable document</a>.</p>
