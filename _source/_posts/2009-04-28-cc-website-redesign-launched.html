<p>We just turned on the first big creativecommons.org site design changes since <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7710">October 2007</a>.  If you're reading in a feedreader and haven't visited the main CC site in awhile, here's a home page screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/"><img src="img/creativecommonsorg-20090428-500.png" alt="CC homepage screenshot" title="CC homepage screenshot" width="500" height="580" /></a></p>
<p>The blog (which of course you're reading now) no longer dominates. Of course headlines from the main CC blog and from jurisdiction projects are still present on the home page, and you can always visit the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog">main blog page</a> or <a href="http://planet.creativecommons.org">planet</a> for the full blog experience.</p>
<p>Previously we made the CC wiki match the main site's theme as closely as possible. That was a good idea at the time, but now that the world is more familiar with wikis, we've brought wiki tools and navigation to the fore.  Here's a screenshot of wiki navigation for a logged in user:</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/"><img src="img/wikicreativecommonsorg-20090428-500.png" alt="CC wiki screenshot" title="CC wiki screenshot" width="500" height="112" /></a></p>
<p>We've also made some incremental improvements to license deeds, consolidating important items that aren't top level license properties under a "With the understanding that:" heading, see screenshot below:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"><img src="img/cc-by-sa-30-deed-20090428-500.png" alt="CC BY-SA deed screenshot" title="CC BY-SA deed screenshot" width="500" height="725" /></a></p>
<p>Next steps include redesigns of the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org">CC wiki main page</a>, our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international">international landing page</a>, further improvements of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">license chooser</a>, and a rethinking of <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org">CC Search</a>.</p>
<p>If you have ideas about how we could improve creativecommons.org sites, please leave a comment, <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues">file a bug</a>, or even submit a patch. All of CC's sites are built on free software and are themselves free software. Visit our <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org">code repository</a> and a guide to where to find source code for the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creativecommons.org_Themes">themes we use for WordPress, MediaWiki, and Drupal</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations on this redesign launch to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#51">Alex Roberts</a>, our senior designer, with support from other staff, and suggestions and <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/donate">financial support</a> from you. Thanks!</p>
