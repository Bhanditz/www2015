<p>One week after the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Diachi plant in March, the Safecast project was born to respond to the information needs of Japanese citizens regarding radiation levels in their environment. Safecast, then known as RDTN.org, started a campaign on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1038658656/rdtnorg-radiation-detection-hardware-network-in-ja">Kickstarter</a> "to provide an aggregate feed of nuclear radiation data from governmental, non-governmental and citizen-scientist sources." All radiation data collected via the project would be dedicated to the public domain using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>, "available to everyone, including scientists and nuclear experts who can provide context for lay people." Since then, more than <a href="http://blog.safecast.org/about/">1.25 million data points</a> have been collected and shared; Safecast has been featured on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLdOkKAeROg">PBS Newshour</a>; and the project aims to expand its scope to <a href="http://blog.safecast.org/2011/11/bgeigie-hackerspace-world-tour/">mapping the rest of the world</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Safecast supports the idea that more data â€“ freely available data â€“ is better. Our goal is not to single out any individual source of data as untrustworthy, but rather to contribute to the existing measurement data and make it more robust. Multiple sources of data are always better and more accurate when aggregated.<br />
<br />
While Japan and radiation is the primary focus of the moment, this work has made us aware of a need for more environmental data on a global level and the longterm work that Safecast engages in will address these needs. Safecast is based in the US but is currently focused on outreach efforts in Japan. Our <a href="http://blog.safecast.org/team/">team</a> includes contributors from around the world."</p></blockquote>
