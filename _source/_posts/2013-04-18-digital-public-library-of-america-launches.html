<p>Creative Commons would like to congratulate the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a> on its official launch today. The DPLA, which has been in planning since 2010, brings together millions of digital resources from numerous libraries, archives, and museums.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dplaalpha/2013/04/18/dpla-coming-soon/">From DPLA</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Digital Public Library of America will launch a beta of its discovery portal and open platform at noon ET today. The portal will deliver millions of materials found in American archives, libraries, museums, and cultural heritage institutions to students, teachers, scholars, and the public. Far more than a search engine, the portal will provide innovative ways to search and scan through its united collection of distributed resources. Special features will include a dynamic map, a timeline that allow users to visually browse by year or decade, and an app library that provides access to applications and tools created by external developers using DPLAâ€™s open data.</p></blockquote>
<p>In January, <a href="http://dp.la/2013/01/21/press-digital-public-library-of-america-recommends-cc0/">DPLA announced</a> that all of its metadata would be in the public domain under the <a href="/about/cc0">CC0 Public Domain Declaration</a>. The Open Knowledge Foundation's Joris Pekel <a href="http://openglam.org/2013/01/21/digital-public-library-of-america-recommends-cc0/">applauded that announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision to apply the <a href="/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 Public Domain waiver</a> to the metadata will greatly improve interoperability with Europeana, Europeâ€™s equivalent of the DPLA. Now that more different initiatives start publishing digitised heritage and its metadata, interoperability becomes more and more important in order to create a linked web of cultural heritage data, instead of new data silos. By both choosing the CC0 Public Domain waiver, Europeana and the DPLA take a great a step forward in achieving their goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>We applaud DPLA's commitment to open data and are excited about the launch of such an important resource.</p>
