<p><a href="http://www.twidox.com/"></a><a href="http://www.twidox.com/">Twidox</a>, "a free, user generated online library of 'quality' documents," launched their private beta today. The "private" beta can be accessed with a beta-code, which virtually anyone can obtain by registering. For readers of this blog, you can simply type in the beta-code "creativecommons" to check out Twidox.</p>
<p>Twidox is a content repository where anyone can upload and publish their work under a Creative Commons license, donate it to the public domain, or retain "all rights reserved" copyright. They have built in CC licensing, so you can easily tag your resources under the license of your choosing. Twidox's focus is on:</p>
<ul>
<li>academic papers and articles</li>
<li>research material</li>
<li>professional and industry specific documents</li>
<li>coursework and dissertations</li>
<li>data and statistics</li>
</ul>
<div>Like Scribd, IssueLab, and a host of other platforms that have built in CC licensing, ccLearn encourages the open publication of educational materials on the internet. We will follow the progress and evolution of Twidox, who "[does] not see similarÂ sites as competitors." They state that "Rather than trying to compete with organisations such as the â€˜Max-<span>Planck Instituteâ€™ and â€˜Frauenhofer Instituteâ€™, for example, we see them as potential co-operation partners and welcome partnerships." They also differ from other content repositories in that they are working to cull content on a wider scale by collaborating with various European organizations, versus simply hosting individually contributed materials. So far, Twidox is working with the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking and also their Office on Drugs and Crime.</span></div>
<p></p>
<div>Twidox was founded by Nicholas and Daniel MacGowan von Holstein and Jan Deppe. The idea for Twidox began in a university when they began "discussingÂ the difficulty of searching for relevant quality documents for research purposes (access toÂ knowledge). The greatest obstacle lay in the relevance of search results returned fromÂ search engines, getting access to subscription-paying sites that did have relevantÂ information and the vast number of websites from different organisations that heldÂ documents on the same subject."</div>
<p></p>
<div>We look forward to seeing collaborations occurring between Twidox and organizations with similar aims.</div>
