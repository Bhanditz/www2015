<p><a href="http://www.joelblain.com/">Joel Blain</a> recently wrote in with an interesting observation:</p>
<p>"I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385333854/">a bio on Woody Guthrie</a>. It's pretty interesting. The book reprints one of the "Copyright Warnings" he included on his recordings in the ealry 40's</p>
<blockquote><p>"This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don't give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that's all we wanted to do."</p></blockquote>
<p>It just made me think of Creative Commons. I dunno if you've seen or heard it before, but I thought I'd pass it along."</p>
<p>Nice find, thanks Joel!</p>
