<p>NPR's <a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2004/Jan/hour1_011604.html">Science Friday</a> last week spoke with Howard Chang, of Stanford Medical School's <a href="http://cmgm.stanford.edu/biochem/deptbiochem.html">Biochemistry Department</a>. Chang discussed his recent article, co-authored with several colleagues and published in the <a href="http://plos.org">Public Library of Science Biology</a> open-access journal, which explores how scientists can learn about cancer from studying the way common wounds heal.</p>
<p>Like all <a href="http://plos.org">PLoS</a> publications, Chang and company's article, <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020007">"Gene Expression Signature of Fibroblast Serum Response Predicts Human Cancer Progression Similarities between Tumors and Wounds,"</a> is free under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/">attribution license</a>.</p>
<p>Recall that one of Creative Commons' <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3957">resolutions</a> is to explore a Science Commons. More unencumbered scientific knowledge to come . . .</p>
