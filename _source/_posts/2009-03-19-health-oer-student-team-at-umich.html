<p>When it comes to the open educational resources world, we all know that the University of Michigan is a pretty hopping place to be, what with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12859">Molly Kleinman</a> as their copyright specialist and their Attribution-only (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>) licensed <a href="http://michigan.educommons.net/">OER repository</a>. Since they pop up pretty regularly in our blogosphere, I didn't want March to pass without a shout-out to the four Health OER advocates (students) that presented at the <a href="http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/">Clinton Global Initiative University</a>, which <a href="https://open.umich.edu/blog/2009/03/10/u-m-health-oer-student-team-selected-to-participate-in-clinton-global-initiative-university/">Open.Michigan</a> wrote about in substantive detail last week.</p>
<p>The students, Nejay Ananaba and Stephanie Munz (School of Dentistry), Matt Simpson (Medical School), and Kathleen Ludewig (School of Information and Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy), are part of a Health OER team committed "to [making] comprehensive health curricula available as open educational resources (OER) to healthcare educators and students." </p>
<p>The scope of the team's strategy spans projects in several countries, including Ghana, South Africa, and Liberia. One significant component is their plan to open up the university's first and second year medical school curriculum in their OER Repository by the year's end. This would allow virtually any country to adapt, redistribute, and teach top notch health OER sans the copyright hassles. </p>
<p>Other projects include establishing the first dental school in Liberia using OER for its curriculum, and developing an OER program and institutional policies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana.
