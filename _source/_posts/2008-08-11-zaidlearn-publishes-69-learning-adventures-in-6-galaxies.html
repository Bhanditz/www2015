<p>One of my must-read blogs on technology and education, <a href="http://zaidlearn.blogspot.com/">ZaidLearn</a> has been rating various learning tools since July of last year. The blog was started by e-Learning Manager for INCEIF, Zaid Alsagoff, who has done research in the areas of "educational gaming, role-play simulation, virtual classrooms, learning (content) management systems, e-learning standards" and "instructional design and courseware development."</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.openeducation.net/2008/08/10/free-e-book-an-excellent-resource-for-teachers-seeking-to-be-technologically-relevant/">OpenEducation.net</a> alerted me to Zaid's first e-book, "<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/4545960/69-Learning-Adventures-in-6-Galaxies">69 Learning Adventures in 6 Galaxies</a>," which compiles and examines the various "learning nuggets" that have been posted on ZaidLearn for the past year. The 267 page book contains a wealth of information regarding the internet and education, espousing some interesting theories like George Siemen's Connectivism and lines of thought from famous persons like Albert Einstein and Henry Ford.</p>
<p>The book is available for download at <a href="http://zaidlearn.blogspot.com/2008/08/69-learning-adventures-in-6-galaxies-my.html">ZaidLearn</a> and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/4545960/69-Learning-Adventures-in-6-Galaxies">Scribd</a>, licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a>.</p>
