<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_industry">The fashion industry</a> has always been an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_industry#Intellectual_property">interesting topic</a> for those interested in copyright and creativity - appropriation, reusue, sampling, etc. are approached in a sometimes similar, yet often starkly different, manner than in other content industries. Styles thrive off of building on pre-existing trends, sometimes directly imitating an established look, and the market decides whether or not this reconceptualization is of worth. It is a debate that has unexpected depth and raises numerous interesting questions - TechDirt has a <a href="http://techdirt.com/blog.php?tag=fashion+industry">bevy of great articles</a> that discus the issues more thoroughly. </p>
<p>Seemingly noting this debate, Berlin-based fashion label <a href="http://www.pamoyo.com/en/">Pamoyo</a> have decided to release the designs for their clothes under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/de/deed.en_GB">BY-NC-SA license</a>, allowing people to recreate Pamoyo's styles at home as long as they don't sell their creations. Similarly, someone can build upon one of Pamoyo's existing designs - if they release the new design publicly they must do so under the same license, continuing the process of reuse and creativity. </p>
<p>Unrelated to CC but interesting nonetheless is Pamoyo's decision to use either recycled clothing or organic cotton for the clothing, with a portion of all profits donated to German Environmental group <a href="http://grass-routes.org/projects.html">Grass Routes</a>. The designs haven't been posted yet, but <a href="http://pamoyo.com/en/atelier/atelier.html">keep your eyes on this space</a> as they should pop up soon (via <a href="http://www.smartplanet.com/news/fashion/10001239/be-an-ethical-fashion-copy-cat-with-pamoyo.htm">SmartPlanet</a>).</p>
