<p>Today, Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/2007/10/creative-commons-launches-third-annual-fundraising-campaign/">officially launched</a> its third annual fundraising campaign. Our goal is to raise $500,000 before Dec. 31st which means we need your support! To help promote this campaign we've redesigned our website (as you may have noticed) to include a dynamic map which shows where in the world our support comes from and released the new <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/donate">2007 limited edition campaign tshirts</a>. We've also revamped the Lessig Letter series and are finalizing the plans for the 2nd annual CC swag photo contest -- stay tuned for details.</p>
<p>I just want to reiterate how important our community's support is to sustaining Creative Commons and the broader movement for "free" culture. We exist for you -- <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/donate">please help us raise these needed funds</a> so we can continue our work providing options for those who believe in a participatory culture.</p>
