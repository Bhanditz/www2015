<p>Hosted by <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccmixter</a> and in collaboration with on-line record company <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> ("we are not evil"), our new remix contest has officially begun. Dust off those samples, record that guitar track, lay down some piano hooks, mix in some Lisa DeBenedictis vocals and send your lovely new creation directly to ccmixter. Not only will you be contributing to the growing online community of remix culture but you have a chance to win an assortment of prizes, including a record contract with Magnatune. </p>
