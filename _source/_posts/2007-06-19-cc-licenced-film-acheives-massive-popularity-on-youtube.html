<p>The Spanish short film, <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12Z3J1uzd0Q">Lo que tÃº Quieras OÃ­r</a></em>--released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/es/">CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license</a>--has achieved a huge amount of popularity on YouTube, totaling close to 10,000,000 views!</p>
<p>While the film itself is quite brilliant, the CC license enables its viewers to not only freely distribute the film, but also remix it as long as they give credit, do so with non-commercial intent, and share their new works under the same license. We can only hope that part of the short's online success has been enhanced by this decision to utilize CC licensing.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the film's <a href="http://www.loquetuquierasoir.com/">website</a> (Spanish; <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.loquetuquierasoir.com%2F&amp;langpair=es%7Cen&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8">English translation via Google</a>) as well!</p>
