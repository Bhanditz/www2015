<p>We're very excited to announce that Davis Guggenheim, a celebrated director and producer of both documentary and dramatic film and television, has joined our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#20">Board of Directors</a>.   Davis brings to our team the invaluable perspective of a creator with both extensive commercial  experience and a commitment to public policy.</p>
<p>In 1999, Davis undertook an ambitious project documenting the challenging first year of several novice public school teachers. Two films resulted from this intensive immersion in the Los Angeles public school system: <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/firstyear/">The First Year</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/firstyear/">Teach</a></em>.  Both films sought to address the tremendous need for qualified teachers in California and nationwide and to create awareness of this crisis -- as well as to inspire a new generation to become teachers.  In 2002, Davis received a <a href="http://www.peabody.uga.edu/news/pressreleases/pressrelease.asp?ID=67">Peabody Award</a> for <em>The First Year</em>.</p>
<p>Davis was an Executive Producer on <em>Training Day</em> and directed a feature film called <em>Gossip</em>, both for Warner Bros.  His television directing credits include recently completed episodes of "The Shield," "Alias," and "24" as well as such critically acclaimed programs as "NYPD Blue," "ER," and "Party of Five."  He is currently a Producer and Director of the upcoming HBO series "Deadwood."</p>
<p>GuggenheimÂ’s other documentary films include <em>Norton Simon: A Man and His Art,</em> produced for permanent exhibition at the Norton Simon Museum, and <em>JFK and the Imprisoned Child,</em> produced for permanent exhibition at the John F. Kennedy Library. Guggenheim wrote and edited many films with his father, four-time Academy Award winner Charles Guggenheim.  Davis graduated from Brown University in 1986.</p>
