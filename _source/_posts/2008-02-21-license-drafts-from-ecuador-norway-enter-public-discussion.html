<p>It is a great pleasure to invite all interested parties to join the teams in <span id="st" name="st" class="st">Ecuador</span> and Norway in discussing these drafts adapted to their respective jurisdictional law.</p>
<p>For their progress and dedication thus far, we would like to thank the CC Ecuador team<span id="st" name="st" class="st"></span>, lead by Dr. Juan JosÃ© Puertas Ortega and Carlos Correa Loyola, and team members Dra. Patricia Pacheco Montoya and Abg. VerÃ³nica Granda GonzÃ¡lez, with support from the <a href="http://www.utpl.edu.ec/">Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja</a>.</p>
<p>Our warmest congratulations extend as well to CC Norway, whose Legal Lead Peter Lenda and Public Lead Gisle Hannemyr, along with their Legal Advisory Board and affiliate institution <a href="http://www.hio.no/content/view/full/4563"> Oslo University College</a>, have demonstrated extreme thoughtfulness and commitment in producing the first draft of the CC license ported to Norwegian law.</p>
<p><em>We welcome your participation in the discussion of these two license drafts!</em></p>
