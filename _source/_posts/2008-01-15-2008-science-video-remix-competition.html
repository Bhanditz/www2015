<p><a href="http://www.laptop.org/en/vision/index.shtml" title="One Laptop Per Child">One Laptop Per Child</a> and <a href="http://www.intelligenttelevision.com/" title="Intellligent Television"> Intelligent Television</a> are working to bring educational video to kids (namely 8 to 16 year-olds) who don't have it.  Your submissions will help to increase the amount of great educational video content available as part of the  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" title="Open Education movement"> Open Education movement</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, anyone can enter---kids, students, teachers, filmmakers, working people with time on their hands... The aim is to gather as much existing scientific video material as we can; this is the first stage of the competition. All contributed video material must be openly licensed (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" title="CC-BY">CC BY</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" title="CC-BY-SA"> CC BY-SA</a> ), which means it can be copied, distributed, transmitted, and adapted by others.</p>
<p>There are other prizes too, which will be awarded by an international panel of judges. After you submit the prime material, the remixing stage will be announced. Remember, it's all about the best science archives. Happy gathering!</p>
