<p>Regional collaborations are strengthening CC projects worldwide. Regular conferences and outreach, coordinated on a regional level by CC Project Leads, are bringing visibility to local initiatives and promoting the ideals of sharing and free culture worldwide. Previous meetings have yielded clearer strategies and collaborations, as demonstrated by the recent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11099">Latam Commons</a>, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9655">growing COMMUNIA network</a>, and last year's successful<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7994"> ACIA workshop</a> in Taipel.</p>
