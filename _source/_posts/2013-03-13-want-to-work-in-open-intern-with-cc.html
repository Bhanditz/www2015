<p>CC is once again opening its doors up to interns this US summer, offering opportunities to those with an interest in community development. </p>
<p>The 2013 Community Support Intern will work with our staff to facilitate CCâ€™s global volunteer network and provide general support for our international activities. This means everything from assisting with coordinating collaborative projects to writing information resources and planning community events. This year will be particularly exciting, as the intern will be helping with preparation for our Global Summit in Buenos Aires, our bi-annual community meeting and single largest outreach event. </p>
<p>The position, which is open to enrolled students of any discipline or level, runs for 10 weeks over June-August here in our Mountain View office. International applicants are strongly encouraged and overseas experience is a plus, although you need to be eligible to work abroad through your university and/or a third-party work-study program. Creative Commons believes strongly in the skills development benefits of internships, and work tasks can be tailored to meet the intern's interests and experience.</p>
<p>For more information and instructions on how to apply, see our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/opportunities#commsupp">Opportunities</a> page.</p>
