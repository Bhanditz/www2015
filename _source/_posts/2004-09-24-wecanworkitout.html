<p>BBC commentator Bill Thompson, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3685988.stm">riffing on the ongoing dispute between Apple Computer and Apple Corps</a> (the Beatles), has a suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the days they set up Apple Corps they were radical hippies who challenged the establishment in many ways.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if they did the same thing now, and made the music available without rights management systems, under a non-commercial Creative Commons license that let others reuse their songs?</p>
<p>It would be a wonderful gesture to the future, recognising that the Fab Four only succeeded because they were inspired by those who came before, taking riffs and musical forms from others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it'll never happen with the Beatles. However, today's radical musicians may wish to consider the message that wraps up Justin Cone's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/movingimagecontest">Building on the Past</a> <strong>before</strong> selling out:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Creativity always builds on the past.<br />
<br />And you're building the past right now.<br />
<br />Share now.<br />
<br />Shape tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
