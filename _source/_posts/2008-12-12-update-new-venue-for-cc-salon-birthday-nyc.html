<p>I was not expecting our humble NYC CC Salon / Birthday to become so popular that I had to find a new venue, but that's what has happened.</p>
<p>With over <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=50435427568&ref=ts">140 people and 76 maybes RSVP'd</a>, TOPP and I were a little worried about whether the building would still be standing after the event.</p>
<p>So our friends at <a href="http://www.foryourimagination.com">For Your Imagination</a> have graciously offered us their loft for the event on Tuesday. I've <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=50435427568&ref=ts">amended the address on the Facebook event</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=10562">blog post</a>, but here it is anyway:</p>
<p><strong><br />
Tuesday, December 16th from 7-10pm<br />
