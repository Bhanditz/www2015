<p><a href="http://www.aviary.com">Aviary</a>'s mission is to "make the world's creation accessible." So it makes sense that they've baked Creative Commons licensing into their platform of live image editing applications. The site has launched with <a href="http://aviary.com/tools">three distinct tools</a> (with more to come) that help artists create and share fantastic images with the eventual intention of creating a new kind of market place to encourage commercial licensing of their CC licensed work through our new <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC+ protocol</a>. Aviary supports both our Attribution and Attribution-NonCommercial license.</p>
<p>One other feature that is unprecedented about Aviary is the ability to load other creator's work directly into a new work, thus allowing for radically efficient in-platform remixing of content. Just think of what could happen if YouTube offered in-browser remix functionality for other people's videos.</p>
