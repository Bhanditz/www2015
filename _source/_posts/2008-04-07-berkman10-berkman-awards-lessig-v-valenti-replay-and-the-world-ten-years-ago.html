<p><span style="float:right;margin:10px"><a href="http://www.berkmanat10.org"><img alt="Berkman at 10" id="wym-1206554246949" src="img/bat10logo_2.png" height="91" width="92" /></a></span>The <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center for Internet & Society</a>, the wellspring of Creative Commons, is celebrating its tenth year with a public conference and awards.</p>
<p><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/berkmanat10/registration">Conference registration</a> is open. A number of current and past CC staff and international project leads will be present.</p>
<p><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/berkmanat10/awards">Nominations for the first Berkman Awards</a> due April 11:<br />
<blockquote>The awards will be presented to people or institutions that have made a significant contribution to the Internet and its impact on society over the past decade.</p>
<p>The primary awardee will receive $50,000, and five smaller awards will be given in specific categories such as: human rights/global advocacy; academic and intellectual leadership; pro bono work; infrastructure/communications tools; arts/culture/media; and news/information/journalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Berkman is also highlighting media from its first ten years, including a classic <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4135">Lessig v. Valenti debate</a> from 2001.</p>
<p>Creative Commons launched December, 2002, a little over five years ago. Wikipedia is seven. Ten years ago Berkman and Mozilla were just getting started. The free software movement was just getting started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_software">25 years ago</a>, but widespread recognition of its potential is not much more than ten years old. What's up for the next 5, 7, 10, and 25 years? <a href="http://www.berkmanat10.org">Berkman@10</a> may be the best conference venue to obtain some insight. The conference, and the future of openness, are sure to be interesting.</p>
