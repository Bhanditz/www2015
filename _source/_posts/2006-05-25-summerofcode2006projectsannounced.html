<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5857">previously mentioned</a>, Creative Commons is participating in this year's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>.  Creative Commons was awarded four project slots by Google, and the selecting the top four was challenging.  We received many, many excellent proposals, and I personally want to thank everyone who took the time to think about a project and submit it.  The projects we'll be working with students on this summer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding EXIF embedding and Flickr upload support to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher">ccPublisher</a>, Robert Litzke</li>
<li>Adding support for uploading to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcHost">ccHost</a> from <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher">ccPublisher</a>, Bruno LuÃ­s GonÃ§alves Dilly</li>
<li>Creating a <a href="http://banshee-project.org/Main_Page">Banshee</a> extension to support embedded licenses, Luke Hoersten</li>
<li>Updating <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/MozCC">MozCC</a> to support <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RDFa">RDFa</a>, Landan Hicks</li>
</ul>
<p>We're very excited to see what this summer's projects will produce.  And if you have some free time this summer, there are still <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges">plenty of ideas</a> for projects that would help the Commons.</p>
