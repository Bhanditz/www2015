<p>So the the American Institute of Graphics Arts (AIGA for short) and the U.S. Department of Transportation released a set of 50 universal symbols "copyright-free" <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentAlias=symbolsigns">online</a>. The symbols are "designed for use at the crossroads of modern life: in airports and other transportation hubs and at large international events." They are intended to be clearly legible from a distance and comprehensible to people of different ages and cultures.</p>
<p><a href="http://funwithstuff.com/blog/index.html">Iain Anderson</a> took these images and produce a <a href="http://funwithstuff.com/dswmedia/airport.html">digital short called "airport"</a>, which is licensed under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license</a>. As Iain says "I'm especially happy to see many blogs in different languages linking to airport, especially as that was the idea. I mean, the symbols were meant for international word-free understanding, it only makes sense that the animation should be word-free and universally understandable too."</p>
