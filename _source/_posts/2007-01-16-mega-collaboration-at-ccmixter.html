<p>In yet another example of our community taking the lead, over 20 ccMixter musicians over the course of eight months and hundreds of emails (including two viruses that wiped out the project each time forcing two re-starts) all under the watchful eye of <a>cdk</a> have unleashed <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/cdk/8522">Mega Collaboration - Welcome to Mixter</a>.  But the story wouldn't mean much if the results didn't pan out. Clocking in at over 13 minutes (!) the result could easily have come from any <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/djspooky-mcguinn">DJ Spooky</a> album. At times experimental at times funky but never losing it's emotional, soulful edge cdk and friends paint a vivid emotional landscape through instrumentation, textures and beats that will not be soon forgotten.</p>
