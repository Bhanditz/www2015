<p><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Howell/?p=113">Notes on "Law That Works" at VON '07</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's not made explicit frequently enough, but one of the core purposes of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative  Commons</a> is to let agents and bots have sex with our permissions data.  That's why the licenses are machine readable.  That's why they can be embedded as metadata in digital files.  Accordingly, we see the early progenitors of flying contracts today.</p></blockquote>
