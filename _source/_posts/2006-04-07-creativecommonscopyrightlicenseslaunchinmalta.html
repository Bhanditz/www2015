<p>San Francisco, USA, and Berlin, Germany â€“ April 7, 2006</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible copyright licenses for authors and artists, today unveils the localized version of its innovative licensing system in Malta. With Malta offering Creative Commons licenses tailored for the specifics of the local legal system, Creative Commons licenses and tools are now available in 30 jurisdictions worldwide.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">groupâ€™s website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Project Leads Brian Restall, Daniele Cop and Alex Spiteri Gingell to adapt the standardized licenses to Maltese law. Creative Commons Malta is being supported by Projects in Motion Ltd.</p>
<p>Today the Maltese versions of the Creative Commons licenses will be launched in Malta, at a launch event being held in the Ammon Suite at the Dolmen Hotel. The launch will follow the closing ceremony of the â€œGlobalisation and Harmonisation in Technology Lawâ€ conference held by the British & Irish Law, Education Technology Association (BILETA).   The event will be hosted by the Law & Information Technology Research Unit of the University of Malta. Professor Lawrence Lessig (Chairman and CEO of Creative Commons) will give the keynote address.</p>
<p>Brian Restall, CEO of Projects in Motion Ltd. Said â€œThe intention behind porting the Creative Commons licenses to Malta was to encourage Maltese artists, students, academics, and researchers to share and distribute their work for free; and help relax the current copyright all-or-nothing proposition. This will permit the local content industry to allow others to copy, distribute, and build on their work so that it can be used in other creative and interesting ways, while still protecting certain parts of their work. This is a very important milestone for the Maltese content industry and provides the legal basis for the free exchange of digital content and a sharing economy in Malta.â€œ</p>
