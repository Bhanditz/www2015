<p>The most frequently used audio and video formats on the web are not open (they're software patent encumbered), which has hindered the development of free and open source media tools. Open audio and video formats face a tough chicken and egg problem: not interesting to publishers if not supported in software, and not interesting to software developers if not much published open format audio and video.</p>
<p>Wikipedia and its media repository, Wikimedia Commons, have long been an important piece in this adoption puzzle. Along with only accepting <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing">liberal copyright licensing</a>, they accept only <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:File_types">free file formats</a>.</p>
<p>Late July the Wikimedia Blog featured two hopeful items regarding open media formats. Both are still developing and well worth checking out despite this late posting.</p>
<p>First, an announcement that <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2008/07/23/kaltura-sponsors-michael-dale-open-source-video-developer/">MetaVid lead developer Michael Dale has been hired by the Wikimedia Foundation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>As many of you may <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Invites_Users_to_Take_Part_in_Open%2C_Collaborative_Video_Experiment">know</a>, Wikimedia is working with <a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/">Kaltura, Inc.</a> to explore collaborative video editing in the Wikimedia projects. Iâ€™m very happy to announce that Kaltura has decided to support the further development of a 100% open source video editing solution integrated into <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a>. To this end, Kaltura is sponsoring Michael Dale, lead developer of the <a href="http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">MetaVid project</a>, to work in the Wikimedia Foundation offices in San Francisco beginning in early August.</p>
<p>Michael will work on adding support for video editing operations and other video-related functionality to MediaWiki, with a rich user interface built entirely on open standards like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_theora">Ogg Theora</a>. Michaelâ€™s work priorities will be coordinated between Kaltura and WMF. I am hoping that we can make incremental improvements to Wikimediaâ€™s video capabilities that will start to become visible to users soon.  <img src="img/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>This is really excellent news. MetaVid impressed when <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5901">presented at a CC Salon two years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Second, a post on news that <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2008/07/31/firefox-31-to-support-open-video-and-audio/">Firefox 3.1 to support open video and audio</a>. This post also has an excellent summary of why open formats matter for free culture. <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2008/07/31/firefox-31-to-support-open-video-and-audio/">Go read it!</a></p>
