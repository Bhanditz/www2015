<p>If you're in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne%2C_Victoria">Melbourne</a> or will be next Wednesday, check out the Free 'Screen' Culture forum which is taking place as part of <a href="http://www.artslaw.com.au/Events/ArtsLawWeekVictoriaMay15to19.asp">Arts Law Week</a>. <a href="http://www.openchannel.org.au/">Open Channel</a> is hosting the forum which will feature 7 panelists debating "Creative Commons - new technologies and licensing for the screen." There will also be a live video and sound remix by Dale Nason and <a href="http://www.toysatellite.org/secession/artists/steve_law.php">Steve Law</a>.  </p>
<p>Panelists will include Philippa Campey from Film Camp, Dale Nason from Cinematic Dispersion,  Nic Suzor from <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">Creative Commons Australia</a>, Frank Rodi from the <a href="http://www.apra.com.au/default.asp">Australasian Performing Right Association</a> (APRA) and Andrew Garton from <a href="http://www.openchannel.org.au/">Open Channel</a>. Given APRA <a href="http://www.apra.com.au/writers/forms_and_guidelines/creative_commons.asp">advises</a> it's members that Creative Commons licensing is confusing and should be approached with caution, the forum should prove to be very interesting and reflect a diversity of views.</p>
<p>Details: May 17, 7 - 9pm at <a href="http://www.cinemanova.com.au/">Cinema Nova</a>, 380 Lygon St, Carlton, AUD5 entry fee (free for OPEN CHANNEL Members) at the door.</p>
