<p><img src="img/kmaa_booklet_cover_sm.jpg" alt="" title="kmaa_booklet_cover_sm" width="200" height="200" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />Last time we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14831">checked in</a> on <a href="http://www.frostwire.com/">FrostWire</a>, an open-source Bit Torrent and Gnutella client, we noted a distinct promotion of CC-licensed music and content to their community. This push has grown drastically in the months following with <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/">FrostClick</a>, FrostWire's curated blog/directory, constantly featuring new and exciting work released under the full <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/">spectrum of our licenses</a>.</p>
<p>Two recent releases in particular highlight the FrostWire community's appetite for open and free music. <a href="http://kelleemaize.com/">Female rapper</a> Kellee Maize's <em><a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2010/01/29/kellee-maize-aligned-archetype-hottest-new-female-mc-with-an-original-dancehip-hop-flavor/">Aligned Archetype</a></em>, a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> licensed hip-hop record, has already received <strong>over 100,000 downloads</strong> from the FrostClick community since its debut last week. Derek Clegg's <em><a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/index.php/2010/02/08/derek-clegg-kjc-popindie-folk-with-a-dab-of-country/">KJC</a></em>, a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> licensed indie-folk effort, has received over <strong>25,000 downloads</strong> in just three days of promotion. These numbers are inspiring to say the least, illuminating the power of curation within communities.</p>
<p>FrostClick is constantly featuring fantastic content, so be sure to check <a href="http://www.frostclick.com/wp/">their blog</a> for regular updates.</p>
