<p>Several of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">iCommons</a> partner groups have asked if they could translate our movies, <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/getcreative/">Get Creative</a> and <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/reticulum_rex/">Reticulum Rex</a> into other languages. Thanks to the licenses we applied on each movie, those are definitely allowed and we'd like to encourage others to contribute to this effort. Towards that end, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/translating">we've put up all the raw audio, script, and flash files</a> for translation purposes.</p>
