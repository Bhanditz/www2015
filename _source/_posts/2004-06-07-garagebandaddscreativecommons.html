<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,63720,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_5">Wired has a short write-up</a> of the <a href="http://garageband.com/">GarageBand</a> (the website for musicians, not the Apple software) annoucement to include a Creative Commons license during song uploads. If you've never tried out GarageBand, sign up and give it a whirl. Listeners rate song samples as one vs. another, and you can view the top rated songs in numerous genres. There's an impressive array of music, all from unsigned bands. On the musician side of things, you can upload music and get feedback and ratings from fans, sort of like a musical HotOrNot.com.</p>
