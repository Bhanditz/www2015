<p>Be creative, be open, and give it your best shot. "Let your imagination run wild and get creative,â€ is the slogan from Magnatune and Creative Commons on their latest venture.  Online record label <a href="www.magnatune.com">Magnatune</a> and non-profit creative licensing organization Creative Commons  announce that they will co-host a digital music remix contest beginning in May of 2005 and will begin accepting entries on June 15, 2005.  The contest will be hosted at <a href="www.ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> and features the music of Magnatune rock artist <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/artists/debenedictis">Lisa DeBenedictis</a>, who will voluntarily have her work sliced, diced and mixed by contestants.  Music samples and contest rules are currently posted at ccMixter, which will begin accepting remix submissions as of May 13, 2005.  Among the prizes for the remix contest is the opportunity for the winner to appear on the Lisa DeBenedictis Remix Compilation album and be eligible for an assortment of cash prizes.</p>
<p>â€œRemixed music is an exciting new kind of musical art form emerging in the open environment of internet file sharing,â€ said Magnatune founder and CEO, John Buckman.  â€œAnyone with a creative urge can take existing music tracks and change them into something completely new and different.  â€œThis kind of event helps artists to stretch their limits and gain access to a wider variety of great musicâ€ explained Magnatune founder and CEO, John Buckman â€œ and we expect some really fantastic remix arrangements to come out of the contest.â€</p>
<p>Contest entrants will have the opportunity to use Magnatune music to create their own remix compositions and submit their best works.  Music samples will be posted on the CCMixter Web site beginning in mid-May.  The contest will officially open on May 16 and will begin accepting entries, through July 31, 2005.  More details regarding contest rules are available at <a href="www.ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a>.</p>
<p>Lisa DeBenedictis is one of Magnatuneâ€™s more than 175 artists who enjoys 50-50 profit splitting and full rights to her music.  A "one-woman operation," she plays a variety of instruments including piano, guitar, keyboard, violin, oboe and mandolin.  DeBenedictis is the sole writer, performer and producer of all her music.  Her songs have been described as ethereal, fresh and original, earning her the comparisons other well-known female soloists including Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan.  Prior to going solo, DeBenedictis performed in a rock duo called â€œRing of Nineâ€ and California Avant Rock duo â€œDirtyDirtyRockStar.â€  In addition to writing songs, Lisa composes instrumental music for film.</p>
<p>The concept of "open source" file-sharing originated in the computer software world, and has moved into music. Individual tracks, a drum or bass line within a recording, can be taken and remixed with other tracks to create a completely new composition.  Other musicians can then modify, improve or add to the â€œsourceâ€ without worrying about obtaining permission from the original artists. Unlike other illegal music remix contests where an artistâ€™s work has been taken and sold without the artistâ€™s permission, Magnatune and Creative Commons have partnered with Lisa DeBenedictis for this effort.  Contest participants will be allowed to freely copy selected Magnatune music to produce their works.</p>
<p>Fellow Magnatune recording artist and CC Mixter contest manager Victor Stone, of the group â€œFour Stones,â€ has been remixing music for several years.  â€œIt is incredibly fun and inspiring to be able to use the best music and make it your own,â€ said Stone.  "It makes remixing a natural extension of what composers have been doing for thousands of years.â€</p>
<p>Producers often work for months to build their multi-layered remix compositions.  Remix tracks can be highly sophisticated with limitless musical sound samples and layers.</p>
<p>Magnatune music is available for sharing through use of Creative Commons licensing.  The Creative Commons license allows for free sharing and building upon existing works, be it musical, written, or images.  â€œWe have been using the Creative Commons copyright licensing very successfully,â€ reports Magnatuneâ€™s founder and CEO,said John  Buckman.  â€œThrough open-source licensing we are able to offer a fair deal to our customers and musicians.â€  Unusual in the music industry, Magnatune splits profits from album sales with the artists and allows them to keep the rights to their music.</p>
