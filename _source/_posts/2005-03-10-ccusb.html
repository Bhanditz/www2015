<p>Last week on this weblog:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5306">USB memory and hardware media player vendors take note -- you can ship your device with great music without asking for permission, because permission has already been granted.</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://magnatune.com/info/press/releases/tuneplug"><img align="right" border="0" src="img/tuneplug_release_pr.jpg" /></a><br />
Today:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://magnatune.com/info/press/releases/tuneplug">Magnatune and Hana Micron Launch TunePlug Portable USB Drive With Pre-Loaded MP3 Music From Leading Independent Artists</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn't exactly a "permission has already been granted" case.  Magnatune uses a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">NonCommercial</a> license, so the USB drive vendor had to ask permission to sell drives filled with Magnatune tracks. However, it is a device shipped chock full of CC-licensed music, which is pretty cool.</p>
