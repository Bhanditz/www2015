<p>Those is the SF-Bay area take note - this Saturday, March 1, <a href="http://www.othercinema.com/">Other Cinema</a> will be screening <a href="http://stealthisfilm.com/Part2/"><em>Steal This Film II</em></a> (discussed earlier <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7789">here</a>) with an introductory talk by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Prelinger">Rick Prelinger</a>. If that wasn't enough, the night looks to be filled with a variety of copyright-related goodness (see description below). From <a href="http://www.othercinema.com/mainframe.html">Other Cinema</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>OC inaugurates its 24th year with a festive celebration of the Open-Source spirit! Headlining is the West Coast premiere of Jamie King's half-hr. Steal This Film (2), a spot-on primer on strategies of access and appropriation in today's Info Age. Initiating the evening is local hero Rick Prelinger, in person, with a provocative performative lecture on motion picture archives. ALSO: The â€œPranksâ€ section of Kembrew McLeod's Freedom of Expression (a phrase that he copywrited, by the way), narrated by Naomi Klein,  plus a heavy mix of media interventions, capped by David Cox' pop-cult mash-upâ€”get thisâ€”in 3-D! And in keeping with the sharewareethic, bring in your unwanted books for potlatch at 8pm with DJ Onanist and FREE-flowin' bubbly! </p></blockquote>
