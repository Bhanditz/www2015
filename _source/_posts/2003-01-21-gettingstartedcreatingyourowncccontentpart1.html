<p>Creative Commons licenses are designed so that creators can share their works with others easily. You might ask "What can I create if I am not an artist, writer, or musican?" but there many options when it comes to personal publishing online.</p>
<p>The first such example is a <b>weblog</b>. Many weblog authors have applied licenses to their daily writings, and you can too. If you're new to weblogs and want to know how to get started, O'Reilly offers <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/12/30/weblog_intro.html">a good introduction to weblogs</a> and walks the reader through using <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> for the first time. Blogroots offers <a href="http://www.blogroots.com/new_to_blogs.blog">a brief introduction</a> that steers readers to using <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger.com</a>'s site to create and manage their weblog.</p>
