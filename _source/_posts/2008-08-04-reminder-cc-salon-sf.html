Check out the presentation lineup:</p>

* CC's Creative Director, Eric Steuer, will talk about the soon to be launched film maker's toolkit.<br />
* Robin Sloan, Product Strategist from <a href="http://current.com/"> Current TV</a>, will wrap up the evening by talking about Current, Creative Commons, and Collaborative Storytelling: What does massively-multiplayer online TV production look like? And does CC fit in to the process?</p>
