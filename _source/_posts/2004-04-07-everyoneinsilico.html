<p><a href="http://nomediakings.org/IMadeMain.htm">Everyone in Silico</a> is a futurist sci-fi novel set in Vancouver, 2036. It came out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568582404/">a couple years ago</a>, but this week <a href="http://nomediakings.org/writing/free_ebook_released.html">the author decided to license it under Creative Commons</a> and produce free downloadable ebook versions. As the author says "So if you like the book, send pals this link, e-mail it to friends, fileshare it on illegal networks -- you'll be helping me out. I know from experience that I'll reap dividends."</p>
