<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/creativecommons/3027812333/" title="Mega Green Flashdrive by creativecommoners, on Flickr"><img src="img/3027812333_e7a0d03f6c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Mega Green Flashdrive" class="alignleft" /></a>  We sold our last <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10668">"JoCo Looks Back" USB jump drive</a> sometime this morning -- they went at an incredible rate that surprised everyone including our supplier. But do not despair, more are on their way, and everyone who <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">donates $50 or more before December 31st will receive one</a>. Thanks for your continued support of CC!</p>
