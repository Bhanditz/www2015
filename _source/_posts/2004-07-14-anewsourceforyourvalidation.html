<p>Since I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3875">first</a> <a href="http://yergler.net/blog/archives/2003/10/15/creative-commons-license-validator">implemented</a> ccValidator late last year, I've been encouraged by the amount of feedback and suggestions I've received.  Common-ers everywhere have pointed out bugs, suggested improvements and  encouraged it's development into a useful tool.</p>
<p>Today, ccValidator has a new home: <a href="http://validator.creativecommons.org">validator.creativecommons.org</a> and a handful of new features.  The validator now supports metadata specified as a seperate file with a <code>&lt;link ...&gt;</code> tag, and hopefully provides some improved error messages when it runs into problems.  If you have any validation links, don't worry: we're redirecting calls to the validator at <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/ccvalidator">yergler.net</a> to it's new home.</p>
<p>Go ahead, kick the tires, and <a href="http://yergler.net/contact">drop me a line</a> if you have a suggestion or bug report.</p>
