<p>Crooked Timber has a post today on <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/003003.html">copyright and attribution</a> that cites Creative Commons:</p>
<blockquote><p>In short, the informal economy of academic attribution is much more like the kind of alternative economy that, say, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a><br />
is trying to create than it is like the copyright industry. Academics<br />
are usually happy when others rip, remix or even parody their work - as<br />
long as the remix artists acknowledge them by name. Similarly, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216">Creative Commons</a> licenses now include a requirement for attribution <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216">as standard</a><br />
(it used to be optional, but 97-98% of Creative Commons users wanted it<br />
in their licenses, so that the CC crowd decided that it was easier to<br />
make it the default). The requirement that people not plagiarize (i.e.<br />
that they not use othersâ€™ work without attribution) presents no<br />
problems whatsoever for â€˜free culture.â€™</p></blockquote>
