<p><a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/"><img src="img/europeana-150.jpg" width="150" height="216" align="right" border="0" /></a><a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">Throughout the #cc10 celebrations</a>, we're highlighting different CC-enabled media platforms, to show the breadth and diversity of the CC world. Today, as we're talking about <a href="/weblog/entry/35563">governmental and institutional adoption of CC tools</a>, it seemed appropriate to discuss <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/">Europeana</a>, the massive digital library of European history and culture.</p>
<p>For people who get excited about open cultural data, one of the most exciting moments of 2012 came in September, when <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34017">Europeana announced that it was releasing its metadata to the public domain under the CC0 waiver</a>. This release of 20 million records represents one of the largest one-time dedications of cultural data to the public domain.</p>
<p>While the data was previously available through the Europeana website, dedicating it to the public domain multiplies its usability. From the <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_col_count=2&_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_itemId=1284453&_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_javax.portlet.action=setItemId">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This release, which is by far the largest one-time dedication of cultural data to the public domain using CC0 offers a new boost to the digital economy, providing electronic entrepreneurs with opportunities to create innovative apps and games for tablets and smartphones and to create new web services and portals.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Europeana's move to CC0 is a step change in open data access. Releasing data from across the memory organisations of every EU country sets an important new international precedent, a decisive move away from the world of closed and controlled data.</p></blockquote>
