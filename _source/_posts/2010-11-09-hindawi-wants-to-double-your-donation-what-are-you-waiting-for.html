<p><a href="http://www.hindawi.com/">Hindawi</a>, open access scholarly journal publisher, wants to double your donation to Creative Commons! Starting right now, Hindawi is matching every dollar of the next $3000 given to CC. That means if you donate $10, $25, $75 to CC right now, your impact will be automatically doubled thanks to Hindawi. Judging by how fast we met wikiHow's challenge a couple weeks ago, you should <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">donate quick</a> to make sure your gift gets doubled!</p>
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/" class="aligncenter"><img src="img/donate-8.png" alt="" title="donate-8" width="172" height="43" class="size-full wp-image-24163" /></a></p>
<p>Here's why Hindawi has chosen to support us this year and why they're challenging you to join them in giving to CC:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hindawi.com/"><img src="img/Hindawi-Logo-Web-10.jpg" alt="" title="Hindawi-Logo-Web-10" width="75" height="73" class="alignright size-full wp-image-24457" style="margin-right:30px" /></a><em>"As an open access journal publisher we believe that it is important for our readers to be comfortable reusing and redistributing our articles without fear of violating any copyright restrictions, and Creative Commons licenses make it clear to readers what they can do with our content."</em></p>
<p>Join Hindawi in <a href="https://www.creativecommons.net/donate">supporting CC</a> and have your donation automatically doubled. If you've haven't yet given to our fundraising campaign (or even if you already have!), now is your chance. It's easy, and you're just <a href="https://www.creativecommons.net/donate">a few clicks away</a> from showing the world you care about an open, sharing online (and offline) world.</p>
