<p><a href="http://gratisvibes.com/">Gratisvibes</a> is a newish blog reviewing and recommending CC licensed electronic music:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gratisvibes aims to lead readers to the best of Creative Commons-licensed Electronic Music on the web, spreading the word for greater musical freedom for both artists and listeners alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>ccMixter star <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/teru">teru</a> has a new remix project, <a href="http://ccmusictime.blogspot.com/">ccMusictime</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The following mixes were made to be used in a classroom setting as background and/or intermission music. In the class I am attending at the moment we frequently work on our own and then meet back up after a pre-determined time. For example we would go work at computer terminals for thirty minutes or take a break for fifteen. The mixes can be used as a musical stopwatch playing 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes of work/study friendly music.</p></blockquote>
<p>The samples are of course from ccMixter and fully attributed.</p>
