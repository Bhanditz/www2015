<p>As anyone following this site closely must know, the Wikipedia community and Wikimedia Foundation board <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14668">approved</a> the adoption of the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> (CC BY-SA) license as the main content license for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites. A <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13967">post about the community vote</a> has many links explaining the history and importance of this move.</p>

<p><a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2009-June/052616.html">Starting last week</a> with English Wikipedia (there are <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Special:SiteMatrix">over 700 Wikimedia sites in over 250 languages</a> -- the image to the right is sourced from <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org">one of them</a>), the <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/5362794">copyright notice</a> on Wikimedia sites is being changed to CC BY-SA. See the <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use">Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>The outreach effort to non-Wikimedia wikis to take advantage of this migration opportunity is ongoing. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14769">Help</a> if you can. One very important milestone was reached June 19, when most wikis hosted by Wikia (there are thousands, including some <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Big_wikis">big ones</a>) <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia:Licensing">converted to CC BY-SA</a>.</p>
<p>Hooray for Jimmy Wales, founder of both Wikipedia and Wikia! (Note the two organizations are unrelated.) CC is fortunate to also have Wales as a member of our board of directors. Without his <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7876">vision</a>, this unification of free culture licensing would not have been possible.</p>
<p>Here's to a huge win for Wikipedians, all of free culture, and everyone who made it possible! Already the licensing change is <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2009-June/052659.html">enabling content to flow between Wikipedia and other projects</a>. Will you <a title="see last paragraph" href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14668">interoperate</a>? See a <a href="http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2009/05/31/wikipedia-migration-impact/">post on my personal blog</a> for a long-winded conjecture about long-term impacts of the licensing change.</p>
<p>Finally, note that this is only one instance of the Wikipedia community showing great foresight and leadership. For example, clearly the Wikipedia community's <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2009-May/052123.html">steadfast commitment to open formats</a> played a major role in giving open video (effectively meaning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora">Theora</a>) a chance for wide adoption, which it now appears on the verge of. Hooray for visionary free culture communities and many wins to come!</p>
<h4>Addendum 2009-06-30</h4>
<p>Erik Moeller writes on the Wikimedia Foundation blog that the <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/30/licensing-update-rolled-out-in-all-wikimedia-wikis/">licensing update has been rolled out on all Wikimedia wikis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the most significant reason to choose CC-BY-SA as our primary content license was to be compatible with many of the other admirable endeavors out there to share and develop free knowledge: projects like <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/">Citizendium</a> (CC-BY-SA), <a href="http://knol.google.com/">Google Knol</a> (a mix of CC licenses, including CC-BY and CC-BY-SA), <a href="http://wikieducator.org/">WikiEducator</a> (CC-BY-SA), the <a href="http://eoearth.org/">Encylcopedia of Earth</a> (CC-BY-SA), the <a href="http://eocosmos.org/">Encyclopedia of the Cosmos</a> (CC-BY-SA), the<a href="http://www.eol.org/"> Encyclopedia of Life</a> (a mix of CC licenses), and many others. These communities have come up with their own rules of engagement, their own models for sharing and aggregating knowledge, but they&#8217;re committed to the free dissemination of information. Now this information can flow freely to and from Wikimedia projects, without unnecessary legal boundaries.</p>
<p>This is beginning to happen. A group of English Wikipedia volunteers have created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Citizendium_Porting">WikiProject Citizendium Porting</a>, for example, to ensure that high quality information developed by the Citizendium community can be made available through Wikipedia as well, with proper attribution.</p>
