<p>Today in the Wall Street Journal, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324669104578204300433143478.html">Creative Commons co-founder Lawrence Lessig has a thoughtful piece</a> about Bassel Khartabil, the longtime CC volunteer who has been detained by Syrian authorities since March.</p>
<blockquote><p>In late 2012, <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,18#thinker19">Foreign Policy named Mr. Khartabil one of this year's top 100 thinkers</a>. The magazine singled him out for "fostering an open-source community in a country long on the margins of the Internet's youth culture."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But Mr. Khartabil wasn't able to accept that honor. He was arrested in March by Syrian authorities because of his work and has been held&#160;&#8212; at times in utter isolation&#160;&#8212; ever since. His family fears the very worst.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Khartabil isn't a partisan, aligned with one Syrian faction against another. He represents a future, aligned against a totalitarian past. The Syrian government is fearful of the potential threat to the totalizing control that defines the modern Syrian state. The government thus wants to shut the free-software, free-culture movement down, in a way that only a totalitarian regime can.</p></blockquote>
