<p>Representatives of two of our favorite organizations recently got together -- <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and CC Brazil affiliate <a href="http://www.direitorio.fgv.br/cts/">Centro de Tecnologia e Sociedade da Escola de Direito da FundaÃ§Ã£o Getulio Vargas no Rio de Janeiro</a>. JT Batson from the Mozilla marketing team <a href="http://jtbatson.blogspot.com/2007/06/today-we-met-with-management-team-from.html">wrote about the meeting</a>. Excerpt:<br />
<blockquote>At Mozilla, we often struggle to relate our core goal (promoting a innovation and choice on the web) to something meaningful for daily users. This challenge isnâ€™t unique to Mozilla. One of the main goals of CTS is to ensure that their research and work, which if focused on development, innovation and democracy, is accessible to the average person. In addition to their many blogs aimed at general consumers, they also developed a real world approach to explaining the impact of copyright owners pushing for â€œpermanentâ€ copyright to materials by having 20 different musicians record different tracks from a high profile Brazilian classical musician whose family is fighting to extend the copyright on his work indefinitely. If the copyright expires on January 1, for example, the 20 new tracks will be released on the 2nd and then on the 3rd, the CTS team will promote a contest to see who can do the best remix of the tracks, which could never have been done before in mass because of the copyright. Rather that just issuing a press release bemoaning the problem, their work to make copyright expiration palatable to a broader audience is down right impressive (forgive my butchering of the example).</p></blockquote>
<p>That is from the first of <a href="http://jtbatson.blogspot.com/2007_06_01_archive.html">several interesting posts about Mozilla's trip to Brazil</a>.</p>
