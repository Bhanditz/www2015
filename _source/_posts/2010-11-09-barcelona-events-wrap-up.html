<p>Since we last <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24072">blogged</a> about CC in Barcelona, we've been very productive. Two weeks worth of open events have yielded several talks around open educational resources (OER) search, discovery, and policy at Open Ed, recommendations and tools for greater open content reuse at the Mozilla Drumbeat Festival, and a 12 month plan for the future of the Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://openedconference.org/2010/">Open Ed 2010</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to an excellent <a href="http://linc.mit.edu/linc2010/presentations/casserly.pdf">talk</a> by board member Cathy Casserly, CC staff members Nathan Yergler and Timothy Vollmer both gave talks that led to fruitful side conversations that will be helpful going forward. Nathan's talk on â€œ<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Search_and_Discovery:_OER%27s_Open_Loop">Search and Discovery: OERâ€™s Open Loop</a>â€ spurred conversations about one of the underlying issues of OER search, which is, "how do you (software, crawlers) know what's an OER and what is not?" Timothy Vollmer's talk on the â€œ<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tvol/inacol-survey-an-inquiry-into-oer-projects-practices-and-policy-in-us-k12-schools">iNACOL survey: An inquiry into OER projects, practices, and policy in U.S. K-12 schools</a>" identified how OER is being used in K-12 online education and investigated the existing OER models at the state, district, and school level. The survey revealed the widespread knowledge of OER among the respondents, but also ongoing questions about the funding models and professional development needs to alert other teachers and administrators about the process and benefits of exploring OER. On the whole, survey respondents were optimistic about the potential for OER, wanting to see it implemented for a wide variety of functions, including the development of digital textbooks to replace hard copy texts, as a component in building better assessment mechanisms, to augment learning materials for struggling students, credit recovery, independent study, college prep and tutoring, special education, library tutorials, and to provide opportunities for students to engage in content and classes that the school doesnâ€™t offer. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/festival/program">Mozilla Drumbeat Festival: Learning, Freedom, and the Web</a></strong></p>
<p>CEO Joi Ito gave a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mozillaeu/5145173989/in/photostream/">keynote</a> and CC's International Project Manager (and Drumbeat Festival program co-chair) Michelle Thorne worked closely with Mark Surman and other Mozillans to make this event happen--a huge shout-out to all the Mozilla volunteers! The Peer Learning Lighthouse tent, organized by <a href="https://creativecommons.net/superheroes/delia-browne/">CC Superhero Delia Browne</a>, Alison Jean Cole (P2PU), and myself, focused specifically on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/Educating_your_users">overcoming barriers to reuse of CC licensed content</a> and a future School of Copyright & Creative Commons at P2PU. One of the coolest outcomes of this tent was tech specifications around a CC attribution generator, a browser and platform plugin that would export the metadata around a CC licensed work to produce a formatted attribution. University of Michigan's <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/">Molly Kleinman</a> and our CTO Nathan Yergler, in collaboration with Mozilla, are working to make this tool a reality. Discussions on the School of Copyright & Creative Commons revolved around increasing global and linguistic reach of the <a href="http://p2pu.org/general/copyright-4-educators-aus">Copyright for Educators</a> courses, and also adapting the course for librarians, policymakers, and creators.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/27668213/Workshop2010">P2PU Workshop</a></strong></p>
<p>All P2PU-produced content is under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>. In order to more effectively educate P2PU participants and course organizers, the P2PU community are planning to integrate copyright and CC license education into its orientation process, in addition to emphasizing the <a href="http://p2pu.org/values">P2PU value of openness</a> as part of a "<a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/31847034/BCNSocialContract">social contract</a>" at the beginning of every course, which will be revised to explicitly call out the license. Additionally, the revamped P2PU platform will introduce values and licensing in the latest stage at the sign-up phase.</p>

<p>Of course licensing was far from the only issue that was talked about. Governance, nonprofit incorporation, sustainability, course formats and content, quality control, research, and more were heavily workshopped, and all outcomes from the workshop are available at the <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/31740468/Workshop2010Agenda">P2PU wiki</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA</a> of course. Immediately after the workshop, the P2PU techsprint, involving volunteer developers and designers, produced the next iteration of the P2PU platform--which you can preview <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johndbritton/5139835878/">here</a>.</p>
