<p>
A great new audio project worth highlighting is the <a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/">Speech Accent Archive</a> at George Mason University. It features 264 native and non-native speakers reading the same paragraph in english. Ever wonder what <a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/romanian2.html">a Romanian from Bucharest</a> sounds like in relation to <a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/english21.html">a Boston accent</a>? Look no further, as <a href="http://classweb.gmu.edu/accent/howtouse.html">it is all released under a Creative Commons License</a>.</p>
