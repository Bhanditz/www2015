<p>For people wanting to learn about CC and its application in different sectors, there is a sea of materials available online. In particular, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">CC&#8217;s international affiliates</a> create a huge number of educational resources that cross language and cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33374">I wrote a post</a> about my work sorting through some of these resources to identify some of the best, focusing on CC license use for public sector information, for publishing content on a variety of digital platforms, and for generating revenue. As promised, today I&#8217;ll highlight some of the resources I&#8217;ve discovered.</p>
<h2>Intro to CC</h2>
<p>For those who are just getting acquainted with Creative Commons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.creativecommons.qa/">CC Qatar</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P-bQB8zUSo">Meet Creative Commons</a> video offers a great introduction to the benefits of CC licensing, the different types of licenses in CC&#8217;s license suite, and how to choose a license that&#8217;s right for your work.</li>
<li>CC Poland has created a great quick guide to the licences in their <a href="http://creativecommons.pl/2012/06/open-poster-about-cc-licenses/">open poster</a>.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re looking for more depth, the new <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-open/">School of Open</a> initiative, a collaboration between P2PU and CC, is just getting off the ground, but it already offers the short <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/groups/get-cc-savvy/">Get CC Savvy</a> course.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CC and Government</h2>
<p>For those interested in the potential of CC licenses to encourage unexpected and innovative re-use of information collected and published by government agencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://epsiplatform.eu/content/topic-report-no-23-creative-commons-and-public-sector-information-flexible-tools-support-psi"><em>Creative Commons and Public Sector Information: Flexible tools to support PSI creators and re-users</em></a>, a paper by CC&#8217;s own Timothy Vollmer and Diane Peters, explains how CC licenses encourage public sector information re-use and why <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> are the most appropriate licenses for this type of information.</li>
<li>If you want to go deeper into this topic, you may wish to look at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8015"><em>Creative Commons licensing for public sector information: Opportunities and pitfalls</em></a> by Mireille van Eechoud and Brenda van der Wal, which was produced in collaboration with <a href="http://creativecommons.nl/">CC Netherlands</a>.</li>
<li>There is also <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/29773/"><em>Enabling Open Access to Public Sector Information with Creative Commons Licenses&#160;&#8212; The Australian Experience</em></a> by Anne Fitzgerald, Neale Hooper and Brian Fitzgerald, which is summarized in the <a href="http://www.aupsi.org/presentations/documents/AF_-Government_cc.pptx">Creative Commons in the Public Sector</a> (3.7 MB PPTX) presentation from <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">CC Australia</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Journalism and Blogging</h2>
<p>For those working on journalism and citizen media in the digital age:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Electronic Frontier Foundation has developed a <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal">Legal Guide for Bloggers</a> that covers many legal topics pertinent to content publishers, including fair use and the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.cientec.or.cr/accceso/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ccjournalism_steuer111209.pdf">Emerging Journalism Models & Creative Commons</a> (3.7 MB PDF) presentation by CC&#8217;s Eric Steuer provides several case studies of new models for journalism that take advantage of CC licenses.</li>
<li>Over at Ars Technica, there&#8217;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/08/creative-commons-images-and-you/">Creative Commons images & you: a quick guide for image users</a>, which gives pointers on finding CC licensed images and offers guidelines for using images under CC NonCommercial licenses.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business Models</h2>
<p>Finally, resources that demonstrate how open content licenses can form an important component of online revenue models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.aupsi.org/presentations/documents/ccmelb2012-EBweb.pptx">Creative Sector Case Studies</a> (1.1 MB PPTX), again from CC Australia, presents cases studies of creators generating revenue by releasing their work to the public under CC licenses.</li>
<li>Musician <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.uk/blog/tabid/84/EntryId/22/Dan-Bull-reaches-number-9-in-the-Indie-charts-with-music-to-which-he-has-waived-copyright-using-CC0.aspx">Dan Bull</a> (via CC United Kingdom), writer <a href="http://whenihavetime.com/2009/04/06/interview-with-cory-doctorow-part-1-copyfight-and-creative-commons/">Cory Doctorow</a> (who has been <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/30/cory-doctorow-copyright-tech-media_cz_cd_books06_1201doctorow.html">writing on the subject</a> for years), and filmmaker <a href="/weblog/entry/14760">Nina Paley</a> have all been interviewed about how (and why) they use CC-licensed works to build a relationship with their audience, increase their distribution, and promote themselves.</li>
<li>On his blog <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</a>, Mike Masnick has written some of the definitive articles about monetization through what he calls the <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090719/2246525598.shtml">&#8220;Connect with Fans + Reason to Buy&#8221;</a> business model.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on business models, see my fact sheet, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/f/f7/BusinessModelsforCreativeWorks.pdf">Business Models for Creative Works & Creative Commons Licensing</a> (90 KB PDF).</p>
<p>The links above represent just a small portion of the resources out there teaching about Creative Commons licensing in different spheres. For more materials, a good place to start is our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Main_Page">wiki</a>, which has pages that collect resources and case studies on a wide range of topics. For resources in your language or relevant to your country, check out your <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">local affiliate&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<p>In closing, I wanted to mention that my internship at CC came to an end last week. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed working with the CC team and learning about the organization&#8217;s work, and hope to stay a part of the CC community.</p>
