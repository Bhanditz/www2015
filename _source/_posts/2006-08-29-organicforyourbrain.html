<blockquote><p>I have been working away listening to streams of fully CC-licensed remixes and tracks from the awesome <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">CCMixter</a> site all day, and just wanted to tell someone. What brought me there was the announcement that <a href="http://www.edtechpost.ca/mt/archive/000733.html">my old favourite</a>, <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/index.php">Freesound</a>, is now <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5968">integrated into ccMixter</a> via the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Sample_Pool_API">Sample Pool API</a>. Ahh, CreativeCommons content - think "Organic," but for your brain ;-)</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Scott! That's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6008">what I'm talking about</a>.</p>
