<p>Santiago, Chile: ccLearn is hosting a three day conference on "open licensing, open technologies, and the future of education in Latin America" from November 19th to the 21st. The conference is split up into three meetings over the three days.Â </p>
<p>Nov 19 is for Creative Commons International, where CC affiliates will meet to discuss the latest developments in licensing and other CC-related issues. Though this day of the conference is only CC, the latter two days are open to all. From the Latam Commons 2008 invitation:</p>
<p>"We are writing to invite you to join us in Santiago, Chile, on Nov 20-21, for a ground-breaking meeting about open licensing, open technologies, and the future of education in Latin America. The meeting on Nov 20 is called Latam Commons 2008: Creative Commons, Open Education, and the Public Domain. It is being co-hosted by ccLearn, the education division of Creative Commons, and Derechos Digitales."</p>
<p>You can <strong>register</strong> for the Nov 20 meeting on Open Education <a href="http://accesoalacultura.cl/registros-cclearn/">here</a>. Registration is <strong>free and open</strong> to anyone until we reach our capacity of 60. So register now to reserve your spot.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.derechosdigitales.org/">Derechos Digitales</a> is also hosting a seminar on the public domain on Nov 21, to which everyone is welcome." There is no attendance limit on this day.</p>
<p>"Latam Commons 2008 is expected to include representatives of different organizations and projects in open education from throughout the Latin American region. The meeting will be a participatory gathering in which all attendees will be able to discuss a range of issues relevant to open education in Latin America, with the goal of developing a broad understanding of major education issues in the region and a focused vision of how open education and widely available educational resources can address these needs. As the workshop will be dynamic and discussion-based, we are inviting anyone interested in these issues to attend and contribute.</p>
<p>Please visit the registration page at: <a href="http://accesoalacultura.cl/registros-cclearn/">http://accesoalacultura.cl/registros-cclearn/</a> You can sign up for one or both of the meeting days at this site. Registration is free, and some meals will be provided for all registered participants. Visit the meeting wiki (<a href="http://derechosdigitales.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_Learn">http://derechosdigitales.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_Learn</a>) for additional information about travel, lodging, and the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>This meeting is intended to catalyze conversations and projects that will continue after the meeting is over, and to build relationships among people and organizations so that we can bring our collective energies and resources to bear on common challenges for open education. Future meetings are already planned, and we look forward to seeing the progress on this global effort that grows out of Latam Commons 2008.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions or concerns to Ahrash Bissell, Grace Armstrong, or Claudio Ruiz. We hope to see you in Santiago."</p>
