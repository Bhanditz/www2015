<div id="_mcePaste">Creative Commons creates and supports free copyright licenses that creators can use to communicate how others can use their creativity. CC's "Some Rights Reserved" has been the mantra for millions of users who wish to share on terms more generous than the default "All Rights Reserved".</div>
<div><img class="size-full wp-image-22682 alignnone" style="border: 0px initial initial;" title="cc.primary.srr" src="img/cc.primary.srr_.gif" alt="" width="88" height="31" /></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">While the branding of Creative Commons--including the logo, license icons, and taglines such "Some Rights Reserved"--has proven beneficial in educating users and growing the "we like to share" community, CC remains grounded in its promise to develop and steward legal and technical infrastructure that makes sharing easy, legal, and scalable.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Users choose the conditions they wish to apply for their creative work--such as a photograph, blog, educational resource, or song from our licensing page. With a few clicks, users then receive the code which embeds the licensing information into the website page where the resource lives. Visually, this is noted with a Creative Commons license icon.</span></div>
<div><a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/license-chooser.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22677 alignnone" style="margin: 10px;" title="license chooser" src="img/license-chooser.png" alt="" width="500" height="359" /></a></div>
<div>Over the years, users have become more familiar and comfortable in licensing, marking, and properly attributing Creative Commons-licensed works.Â <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">But still, we see there's a lot of education to do, and at CC, we want to make sure users "say what they mean" when they license their creativity under a Creative Commons license. To that end, we're retiring a the "Some Rights Reserved" icon. </span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">This icon was available via the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">CC license chooser</a>.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">While the complete output provided a correct link to the specific license, the visual component was simply the "Some Rights Reserved" icon. As you can see, simply saying "Some Rights Reserved" is akin to saying "licensed under Creative Commons" -- it's useful, but only to the extent that users take the time to investigate the specific license terms. By nudging users to "say what they mean", CC will continue to champion easy-to-use, practical licensing and marking. Plain and simple, the "Some Rights Reserved" icon is not appropriate as a component of a license notice. Don't worry, for those that are already using the icon, we'll continue to serve up the image from our servers. However, going forward, the "Some Rights Reserved" button will not be a choice offered to users via the license chooser. We think this change will only help the CC community of users to better communicate what they mean in a more clear and useful way.</span></div>
<div>Creative Commons <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking">hosts information on the wiki</a> that explains the best practices with regard to marking for both creators and users. And, community members have been helping <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/2008/08/15/cc-howto-1-how-to-attribute-a-creative-commons-licensed-work/">explain how to attribute Creative Commons-licensed works</a>.Â <span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Interoperability is something we think about all the time, and there's no shortage of ongoing discussions about the best way for users to be able to use and reuse content. If we wish to support interoperability, we need users to communicate what they truly mean. In order for users to say what they really mean, they need to communicate the specific license.</span></div>
