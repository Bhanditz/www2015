<p>Creative Commons and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT)  introduce innovative copyright licenses to Australia</p>
<p> San Francisco, USA and Brisbane, AUSTRALIA ï£§ Jan. 19, 2005 ï£§ Creative  Commons, a nonprofit organization that offers a flexible copyright for creative work, today unveiled a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Australia. The Creative Commons licenses afford authors and publishers an  intermediate degree of protection over their photos, music, text, films, and educational materials under a â€œsome rights reservedâ€ copyright, in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reserved.â€</p>
<p>With the announcement, Creative Commons now offers free legal tools in a total of fifteen country-specific versions. The organization already provides copyright licenses specific to Austrian, Belgian, Brazilian, Croatian, Dutch,  Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, U.S., Taiwanese, Canadian, and Spanish law, thanks to a global network of artists, lawyers, and technologists.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™s offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with project lead Professor Brian Fitzgerald of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Australia, to adapt the standardized licenses for use under  Australian law.</p>
<p>Professor Fitzgerald, an internationally recognized expert in intellectual  property and technology law, said, â€œNormally to use other people's copyright you have to go through a time-consuming process to negotiate your legal rights. What we aim to do with Creative Commons is to be able to license or negotiate  those rights through a website with the click of a mouse."</p>
<p> Creative Commons released the new legal tools, which are available free of  charge from the Creative Commons website, at a conference at the QUT today. Lawrence Lessig, professor of law at Stanford University and chairman of Creative Commons, delivered a public lecture on open content licencing at the  conference.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s wonderful to see this organization become truly global,â€ said Neeru  Paharia, Assistant Director of Creative Commons, who is visiting Brisbane for the launch. â€œWe hope to localize the Creative Commons licences to other countries of the Asia-Pacific region very soon.â€</p>
<p>The worldwide expansion of the Creative Commons is one of the main priorities of the San Francisco-based organization for 2005.</p>
