<p>Creative Commons is hiring a web developer/sysadmin (let's call it a web engineer) for its San Francisco office.  The technical requirements are broad but not deep -- the ideal candidate would have the ability to learn quickly and willingness to tackle any technical task with gusto -- from IT drudgework to developing cool web apps. See the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#web">job description</a> for application details.</p>
<p>Please forward to anyone who would be interested but just happens to be offline for a spell. What other excuse would they have for not reading the CC blog? :-)</p>
<p>Also check out our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities">openings for General Counsel and CC Learn Executive Director</a>.</p>
