<p>In case you missed it, we have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities/#intern">extended our deadline for 2008 Summer Intern Applications to March 21</a>, meaning that you have two more weeks to get <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8037">all the necessary materials submitted</a>! The CC internships are a great opportunity to engage with the CC-community as a whole and actively experience the amazing opportunities the bay area has to offer. There are four different intern positions available - <strong>Community Development</strong>, <strong>Business Development</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong>, and <strong>Development/Fundraising</strong> - presenting a variety of avenues for potential interns to explore.</p>
<p>As a former intern, I feel comfortable saying that while these positions are not for the faint of heart ("full time means <em>full</em> time!", "why isn't this wiki formating working?") they are incredibly rewarding in terms of a give/get ratio. You have the opportunity to work on some amazing projects with some equally (if not more) amazing people and ultimately walk away with a ton of real experience under your belt. Anyone who is interested in the issues that face the CC-community and is looking for a valuable way to spend their summer should apply for one of these positions without hesitation.</p>
