<p>If you missed out on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4025">moving images contest</a> earlier this year, you have a second chance of sorts.</p>
<p>The Center for the Study of the Public Domain's <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/contest/">Arts Project Contest</a> is based on our moving images contest.</p>
<blockquote><p>A contest to create a 2-minute moving image that explains to the public some of the tensions between art and intellectual property law, and the intellectual property issues artists face, focusing particularly on either music or documentary film.</p></blockquote>
<p>Entries, due November 1, must be released under a Creative Commons license.</p>
