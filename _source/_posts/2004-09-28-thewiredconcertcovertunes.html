<p>Another cool aspect of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4415">the WIRED show last week</a>: Gil and Byrne both played a lot of covers. As Justin Cone's <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=opensource_movies&collectionid=Justin_Cone_-_Building_On_The_Past">award-winning Creative Commons film</a> says, "Creativity always builds on the past . . ."</p>
<p>Among his originals, Gil also played:</p>
<blockquote><p>--Cambalache (Enrique Santos Discepolo -- a dark Argentine tango)<br />
<br />--Imagine (John Lennon)<br />
<br />--Three Little Birds (Bob Marley)<br />
<br />--No Woman No Cry (Bob Marley, with some Portuguese lyrics)<br />
<br />--Soy Loco Por Ti America (Caetano Veloso)
</p></blockquote>
<p>And Byrne covered:</p>
<blockquote><p>--I Zimbra (this Talking Heads song isn't technically a cover, but the lyrics are from a Dadaist "sound poem" by Hugo Ball from the 20s, so I'm counting it)<br />
<br />--One Rainy Wish (Jimi Hendrix -- yes, Hendrix with a string section -- fantastic!)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4415">And together</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>--Asa Branca (Gonzago & Teixeira)<br />
<br />--Don't Fence Me In (Cole Porter)</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, if only sampling from other people's songs were as simple as <a href="http://www.cdbaby.net/dd?f=8">doing</a> <a href="http://www.ascap.com/licensing/licensingfaq.html">covers</a>. Soon, it will be -- <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">for a handful of songs</a> at least.</p>
