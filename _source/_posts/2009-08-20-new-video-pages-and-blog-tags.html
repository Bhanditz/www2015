<p>I've spent the last few months of Summer volunteering for Creative Commons, and in that time I've had a great opportunity to do a few little things that should make CC outreach and communication a little bit more effective.</p>
<p>First, I've been working a lot on the Videos section of the site, dealing specifically with promotional and informational CC videos.  I've reorganized <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Videos">the Videos page on the Creative Commons wiki</a>, finally putting together all the source assets and translation information in one place.  That page may change a bit more in the coming weeks, but already it's a lot clearer and easier for people who want to engage with the videos.</p>
<p>In addition to the wiki page, I've added a few links and a bit more information to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos">the individual video pages on the main site</a>.  We hope that now the translation materials and source assets are displayed more prominently, people who are inspired will be enabled to jump in and translate or remix or mash up the videos.</p>
<p>The other major project I've been tackling this summer is adding "tags" to the CC weblog posts.  As you'll notice on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/">the right of the main Commons News page</a>, our most popular tags are visible are now visible, and each individual post has tags at the bottom of it, which you can click on for more posts tagged in the same way. For example, check out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/free-music-archive">Free Music Archive tag</a> which displays all the posts related to WFMU's Free Music Archive project. I've tagged a full year of CC posts and we will continue this habit going forward.  This should make it easier to find things that we've blogged about that are especially relevant to your interests, as well as track related stories more efficiently. </p>
<p>These are just a few little projects I've had the pleasure of tackling as a CC volunteer.  I hope it makes it easier for everybody to find their way around the site!</p>
