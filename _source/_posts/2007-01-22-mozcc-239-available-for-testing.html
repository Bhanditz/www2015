<p>If you're a fan of embedded metadata (and really who isn't?), you might want to check out the latest release candidate of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/MozCC">MozCC</a>, version 2.3.9.  MozCC 2.3.9 isn't available from addons.mozilla.org yet; we're just putting it out there for some testing.  You can find the download link <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Installing_MozCC">in the wiki</a>.  This version includes fixes for two problems recently reported:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance slow-downs when visiting pages with lots of metadata and</li>
<li>problems with MozCC breaking other Firefox extensions (including <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4106/">Operator</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find bugs or have suggestions, you can report them by <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Report_MozCC_Bug">filing a bug</a> or leaving a comment on this post.   We hope to ship the final release (2.4.0) next week and make it available for automatic update for those of you who've installed from addons.mozilla.org.</p>
