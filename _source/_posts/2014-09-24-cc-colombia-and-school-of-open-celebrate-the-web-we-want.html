<p>This Friday, School of Open and Creative Commons affiliates in Colombia are throwing a celebration of the Web We Want that will highlight open licensing, copyright reform, and free culture. The event takes place as part of the Creative Commons Film Festival in BogotÃ¡. Its purpose is three-fold:</p>
<ul>
<ol>1) To launch a campaign to promote fair use in copyright reform that is pending Colombia. This campaign is named, <em>Liberen la cultura</em> or <em>Let's set culture free</em>.</ol>
<p></p>
<ol>2) To support the Colombian biologist Diego GÃ³mez, who is facing a criminal case against him for copyright infringement. This campaign is named #CompartirNoEsDelito or #sharingisnotacrime.</ol>
<p></p>
<ol>3) To promote live music, books, magazines and films under CC licenses.</ol>
</ul>
<p>As part of both campaigns, affiliates will hold a LicenciatÃ³n, a day of awareness, learning and practice for open licensing and its relationship to free culture. This activity incorporates portions of the School of Open course, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42977">ABC del derecho de autor para bibliotecarios de AmÃ©rica Latina</a> (ABC of Copyright for Librarians in Latin America). Promotional material about the course will also be shared.</p>
<p>Colombian volunteer Maria Juliana says,</p>
<blockquote><p>We are pleased to announce that as part of the Creative Commons Film Festival, the program will include a Celebration of the Internet, a space that seeks to unite all of us who are interested in an open web where we can contribute and share content freely -- a space to celebrate the Web We Want!<br />
<br />
We will be celebrating with our friends â€œRadio Pachoneâ€ and our special guests will be: â€œLa Real Academia del Sonidoâ€ and â€œRadio Mixticiusâ€.<br />
<br />
The celebration takes place thanks to â€œA Year of Actionâ€ campaign of Web We Want, this campaign convocated organizations around the world to generate actions to celebrate 25 years of the web; we are one of the organizations which benefited.</p></blockquote>
