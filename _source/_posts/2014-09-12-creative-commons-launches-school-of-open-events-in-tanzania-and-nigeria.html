<h3>About Maker Party</h3>
<p><em>School of Open and Creative Commons is excited to be partnering with Mozilla to celebrate teaching and learning the web with <a href="http://party.webmaker.org/">Maker Party</a>. Through thousands of community-run events around the world, Maker Party unites educators, organizations and enthusiastic Internet users of all ages and skill levels.</p>
<p>We share Mozilla's belief that the web is a global public resource that's integral to modern life: it shapes how we learn, how we connect and how we communicate. But many of us don't understand its basic mechanics or what it means to be a citizen of the web. That's why we're supporting this global effort to teach web literacy through hands-on learning and making with Maker Party.</em></p>
<h3>About the School of Open</h3>

<p><em>The <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a> is a global community of volunteers focused on providing free education opportunities on the meaning, application, and impact of "openness" in the digital age and its benefit to creative endeavors, education, and research. Volunteers develop and run courses, workshops, and real world training programs on topics such as Creative Commons licenses, open educational resources, and sharing creative works. The School of Open is coordinated by Creative Commons and P2PU.</em></p>
