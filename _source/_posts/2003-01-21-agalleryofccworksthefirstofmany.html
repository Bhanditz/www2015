<p>The folks over at eastwest.nu have setup <a href="http://www.eastwest.nu/mtblog/archives/gal/cat_simulacra_some_rights_reserved.html">a small gallery of images</a> that use Creative Commons licenses. This is a great example of how others can use CC licensed works that matches much of the intention behind the licenses. My own images are featured which I was surprised but pleased to see, and others featured have <a href="http://www.harrumph.com/h/000086.shtml">expressed similar satisfaction</a> with it. In the future I could imagine seeing other, larger-scale galleries of licensed works, I could see new stock photo sites created featuring CC licensed works, and I could even envision books of CC licensed photographs that work within the licenses. Anyone can be an editor, and compile sets of their favorite works for redisplay on their own site (paying attention of course to license terms like proper attribution and non-commercial uses).</p>
