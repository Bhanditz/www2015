<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/"><i>Red Hat Magazine</i></a> has posted a good <a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/023sep06/features/jamendo/">interview with Laurent Kratz</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo</a>, a large (and rapidly growing!) site for Creative Commons-licensed music. In the interview, Kratz discusses his company's business model and how artists can use openness to expand their audience and make money. Read on â€¦ and look out for another interview with Kratz coming soon (conducted by yours truly) at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creativecommons.org</a> as part of our Featured Commoners series of articles.</p>
