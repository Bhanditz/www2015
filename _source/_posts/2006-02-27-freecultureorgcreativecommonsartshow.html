<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5753">Last time</a> we reported on FreeCulture.org NYU, they were getting accolades in the Village Voice for taking part in a regional <a href="http://freeculture.org/">FreeCulture.org</a> summit. Now NYU FreeCulture.org has organized an <a href="http://www.freeculturenyu.org/ccartshow/">art show</a> featuring works all licensed under Creative Commons. The opening is this Wednesday, March 1st on 7th floor of the Kimmel Student Center at 7 pm. The show will also be on-line. This art show is the first of its kind-good work NYU FreeCulture.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b>: Last June, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5509">blogged</a> about Rob Myers show in Belgrade of all licensed Creative Commons art. Also, in 2005, <a href="http://www.remixreading.org/">Remix Reading</a> hosted an art remix contest of all CC licensed art. Thanks <a href="http://tom.acrewoods.net/about">Tom</a>!</p>
