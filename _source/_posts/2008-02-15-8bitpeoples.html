<p>Today <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8043">seems to be the day that</a> unique, experimental, CC-licensed record labels show up on our radar. <a href="http://8bitpeoples.com/">8bitpeoples</a>, "a collective of artists sharing a common love for classic videogames", specializes in retro video game goodness, creating music that <a href="http://8bitpeoples.com/our_mission.html">reflects a clear obsession with old NES soundtracks</a> and the wonderfully brittle noises of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>.</p>
<p>Less record label than musical co-op (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_6">Elephant 6</a> in an arcade) 8bitpeoples release their various works under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND license</a>, allowing their musical creations to be legally shared freely across the web. <a href="http://8bitpeoples.com/discography_gfx.php#8BP078">Check out their back catalog here</a>, complete with <a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com/_images/discog/jewel/rushjet1_-_out_there.gif">aesthetically similar cover art</a>. </p>
