Flickr describes Moo Cards as â€œtiny wonderful calling cardsâ€ for the real world.  To make Moo Cards, log into your Flickr account and click on Moo in the â€œDo More With Your Photos!â€ box.  You can choose a photo from your personal Flickr stream for the front of the Moo Card, and you can customize text for the back of the card.  When you customize your text, Moo has introduced a CC License option that allows you to insert your CC license information and the CC logo on the back of the Moo Card.</p>
