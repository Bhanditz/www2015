<p>October 13, 2007  --- San Francisco, CA, USA and Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization dedicated to building a body of creative work that is free and legal to share and build upon, unveiled today a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Greece.</p>
<p>With the Creative Commonsâ€™ project in Greece joining the effort, Creative Commons licenses are now being offered in localized versions in a total of 39 countries around the world.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with project leads Marinos Papadopoulos, Theodoros Karounos, and Prodromos Tsiavos to adapt the standardized copyright licenses to Greek law.</p>
<p>Today the Greek version of Creative Commons will be launched in Athens, at an event in the Ceremonies Hall at the University of Athens. Lawrence Lessig, founder and CEO of Creative Commons, will give the keynote address at the ceremony, which will be hosted by Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET).</p>
<p>â€œThe real value of the Creative Commons licenses,â€ says Marinos Papadopoulos,  â€œcomes in clarifying what is useful to both creators and users of intellectual property, while also providing them with the tools to share creations in a mutually acceptable legal environment. By helping both creators and users determine the value of intellectual property sharing, Creative Commons in Greece is helping an explosive growth in creativity.â€</p>
<p>About GRNET</p>
<p>The Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET) supports the research and development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) within Greece and internationally, through the provision of its high-capacity networking and grid computing infrastructure, the strengthening of e-Learning &amp; e-Business practices, as well as the participation in international research and education efforts. GRNET operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Development and is supervised by the General Secretariat for Research and Development.</p>
<p>About Creative Commons</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach. Creative Commons is sustained by the generous support of organizations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as members of the public.
