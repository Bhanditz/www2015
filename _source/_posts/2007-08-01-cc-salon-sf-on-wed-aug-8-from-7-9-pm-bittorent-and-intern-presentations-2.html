<p>This is just a reminder - on Wednesday, Aug 8th, from 7-9 PM, we will be returning to <a href="http://shinesf.com/">Shinesf.com</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1337+Mission+St.+San+Francisco&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">1337 Mission St. in San Francisco</a>) for another <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">Creative Commons Salon</a>! The Salons are a great opportunity to meet-up with others interested in Creative Commonsâ€™ flexible licensing, technology and standards and informally discuss how we can all work together.</p>
<p>Joining us will be <a href="http://www.ashwinnavin.com/">Ashwin Navin,</a> President and Co-Founder of Bittorent, Inc., who will be discussing the overlaps between the CC community and Bittorent as well as what this means in the near future. Also, all of us summer interns will be presenting on what weâ€™ve been up to for the past two months. We have some other tricks up our sleeves, but you will have to wait until Monday to find out what...</p>
<p>As always, music and drinks will top everything off. Here is the link on <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/199764/">Upcoming</a> - weâ€™ll see you there!</p>
