<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">pete was juggling tomatoes. bored. so he telephoned a few friends instead. â€œhow about getting together to make an anti-racism song and music video?â€ all said yes without hesitation. not because pete threatened them with a rusty knife. only because they love malaysia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so began <a href="http://www.malaysianartistesforunity.info">Malaysian Artistes For Unity</a>, a collaboration which has since swelled to over 150 active members working with creative, non-partisan projects to build awareness and tolerance in Malaysia.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The group, in close partnership with <a href="http://creativecommons.org.my/">Creative Commons Malaysia</a>, has released <a href="http://www.malaysianartistesforunity.info/?page_id=20">a lovely video</a> to share their cause. Shot in Kuala Lumpur and co-directed by Yasmin Ahmad, the video features a colorful cast of well-known Malaysian artists singing "Here In My Home," a song written and co-produced by Pete Teo from CC Malaysia's board of directors. The text is in four languages and speaks to the diversity and vibrancy of Malaysia's cultural communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">The video and audio files are <a href="http://www.malaysianartistesforunity.info/?page_id=19">available to download</a> under CC BY-NC-ND and CC BY-NC-SA. Furthermore, <a href="http://www.digitalmalaya.com/unity/">Unleash Creativity for UNITY</a>, a spin-off project by Muid Latif and Digital Malaya, has been developed  to encourage CC-licensed remixes of the video and other works to share and spread art in Malaysia.</p>
