<p>I'm excited to be speaking tomorrow with the young journalists at the <a href="http://boston.journalismconvention.org/">National High School Journalism Convention</a>. A few months ago, Creative Commons had a table at <a href="http://sanfrancisco.journalismconvention.org/">a similar convention in San Francisco</a>. When we saw the enthusiasm that the students there had about open licensing, we decided to start planning a session about Creative Commons for young journalists.</p>
<p>Whenever I'm talking with high schoolers about Creative Commons, one thing always strikes me. <em>They get it</em>. Today's young content creators don't dream of spending 40 years working for a single publisher or media company. They're preparing to piece careers together working on projects for lots of clients with lots of different business models; therefore, they intuitively know the value of using open licensing to get their work out to as wide an audience as possible. <a href="/weblog/entry/39685">Or as Cathy put it</a>, "The creators who are thriving today are the ones who use internet distribution most innovatively; in fact, the ones who are most generous with their work often reap the most reward."</p>
<p>I'm hoping to use this session to meet some people at school journalism programs who'd like to experiment with ramping up their sharing. What if your school newspaper went 100% CC for a year? Where would the content get republished? How would it impact your staff's r&#233;sum&#233;s? Interested? Let's talk.</p>
<p>Here are my slides for the session (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yaucoZetAtRBjWBtLPG-UfAtE3LD8Mz6gZEu1eTxQxU/edit?usp=sharing">see the speaker notes</a> for more information and links):</p>
