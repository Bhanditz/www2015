<p>It has been 24 hours since the launch of the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/">CCi Scholarship Funding Campaign</a>  and the response has been incredible. $6,366 has been raised so far thanks to you! At this rate we'll finish the campaign 6 days before the 2 week time period ends.</p>

<p>There are several different ways you can participate and support CC. One way would be to visit the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/store">CC Store</a> and check out one of our popular CC T-shirts. One of my personal favorites is the CC Logo shirt. Thank you again <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeblogs/323586599/in/pool-ccswagcontest06/">MikeBlogs</a> for this amazing photo (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7408">reason</a> that we are attempting this feat is to enable as many of the CCi Affiliates as possible to attend the critical <a href="http://icommons.org/isummit-07/">iCommons iSummit</a> in June. These dedicated volunteers have played a large role in the momentum behind CC and the global digital commons. And for this work we are forever thankful.<br clear="all" /></p>
