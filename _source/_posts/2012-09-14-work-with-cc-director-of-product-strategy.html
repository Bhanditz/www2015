<p>Creative Commons is looking for an experienced, innovative, and technically inclined individual to drive product development at CC. This individual will play a highly influential role in the future of Creative Commons as we look to the next 10 years.</p>
<p>For those that have been paying attention, this is indeed a re-imagination of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28240">previous solicitation for a Chief Technology Officer</a>. This role has expanded to be a more general direction setting position within CC vis-a-vis tools and products that will enable and sustain CC and its community.</p>
<p>Creative Commons started with a vision of leveraging the Internet to scale the sharing of our collective cultural, scientific, and educational output. To that end, there is an unimaginable number of freely licensed works to build upon, and to build services around, and 90% of the technical groundwork is laid (meaning, of course, there is still more than 90% of the way to go!). Now is an incredibly exciting time to lead the product and technology efforts of Creative Commons â€” be part of a great team, help communities yearning to share better and more effectively, and engage with developers around the world to help build a better future.</p>
<p>And it is an interesting place to work! Some unique aspects of the CC technical and product team:</p>
<ul>
<li>All software developed by CC is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>; see our <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/">source repositories</a> and <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues">bug tracker</a>;</li>
<li>We have a small (two software engineers, one system administrator) technology team focused on maintaining and improving CCâ€™s services (implemented using Python, CiviCRM, WordPress, MediaWiki, and other technologies); additionally technology suffuses all of our work, including when policy-oriented â€” the technology team and especially CTO are frequently called on to provide leadership on broad issues;</li>
<li>See our <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/">CC Labs blog</a> for occasional posts on the details of our technical work and thoughts on related happenings;</li>
<li>Watch recordings of past <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/TechSummit">CC technology summits</a>;</li>
<li>Read about the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_REL">CC Rights Expression Language</a>, a set of recommendations implemented across CCâ€™s services and by many publishers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weâ€™re accepting resumes through October 12. See the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/opportunities#dps">job posting</a>  for details.</p>
