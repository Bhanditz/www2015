<p>There's more action at the online home of Into Infinity (see this <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8998">previous post</a> for a full description of the project). The new automated <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/nesting">"nesting"</a> page pulls in visual pieces of the show at random and embeds them within one another to create interesting combinations. Sometimes the results don't quite make sense together, but I've been surprised by how often they turn out incredibly well. I hooked my laptop up to a large television this morning and let the page run for a couple of hours - my flatscreen never looked so arty.</p>
<p>Also, we just came across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TddBRWfWRuE">two</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftNE0ySo5vM">videos</a> by musician <a href="http://keenaninstereo.blogspot.com/">Keenan Gaynor</a> that show him using Into Infinity's <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/mixer">Audio Mega-Mixer</a> (see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10534">previous post</a>) to mix the project's sound loops and create new music on the fly. We'll be adding more features to the mixer soon that will allow you to do things like record your jam sessions.</p>
