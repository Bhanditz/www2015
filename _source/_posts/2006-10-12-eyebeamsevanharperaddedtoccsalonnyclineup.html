<p>There's a great addition to the line-up for the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/114069">CC Salon NYC</a> happening at Nublu from 8-10pm this Friday, October 13:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Evan Harper of <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/">Eyebeam</a></b><br />
Evan oversees technical things in the Production Studio. Professional highlights include recreating memorable scenes from the Donny & Marie Show in diorama form and fixing broken appliances he found on the sidewalk. When he isn't hard at work he likes to bake cookies, read to blind children and feed orphaned birds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>More info about the event can be found in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6094">previous blog post</a>.</p>
