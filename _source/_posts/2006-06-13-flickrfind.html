<p>Last month we noted that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5906">Flickr added the same CC search options</a> to its advanced search that <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/cc">Yahoo! web search</a> offers (Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">advanced search</a> has differently phrased but equivalent functionality).</p>
<p>Now we've added Flickr search to our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/find/">find page</a>, from which you can now search for CC-licensed content indexed by Google and Yahoo! as well as the 14.2 million CC-licensed images hosted by Flickr (1.5 million added in less than a month).</p>
