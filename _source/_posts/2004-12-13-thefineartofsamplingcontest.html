<p>On December 15, 2004 Creative Commons will launch the Fine Art of Sampling Contest.  The contest intends to build off of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">WIRED CD</a>, where contestants will be challenged to sample the WIRED CD song(s) they love most, into their own creation of musical genius. Look for the announcement here on December 15th!</p>
