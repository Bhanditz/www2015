<p>This from someone who attended <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4415">the concert</a> last Tuesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was truly one of the most inspired shows I've seen in a while. Not just the music, which was tremendous, but the entire feeling, established early on through the films; that we were involved in reclaiming and resuscitating creativity and the cross fertilization of cultures. The only downside for me was that it was SO inspired, I started beating up on myself during the performance for not cleaving closer to my own personal dreams. So ever since that show I've been working on getting the hell out of TV production. Thanks, Creative Commons!</p></blockquote>
<p>I promise I didn't write this myself. I don't even think I could have come up with this. Inspiring stuff.</p>
