<p>Thanks to everyone who came out to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=8901">September's CC Salon NYC</a>, and to the wonderful TOPP for hosting us again. We had an even bigger turn out this time (perhaps because <a href="http://www.timeout.com/newyork/events/city-picks/204001/creative-commons-salon-nyc">Time Out New York wrote us up</a>), but just as much fun. Keep an eye out for December's event!</p>
