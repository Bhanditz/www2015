<p>In the world of weblogs, we've noticed a couple notable recent adopters of Creative Commons licenses. <a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/theme/dvd-2600-trial.html">Jon Johansen</a>, the teenage hacker that famously <a href="http://web.lemuria.org/DeCSS/">cracked DVD encryption</a> so he could watch a movie he purchased on his computer, started a blog called "<a href="http://nanocrew.net/blog/">So Sue Me</a>." He was <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=466519">recently acquitted</a> of charges he did anything wrong.</p>
<p>A great looking blog centered around the design of books, called <a href="http://www.ospreydesign.com/foreword.html">Foreword</a>, is another interesting new site carrying a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>Also of note is <a href="http://www.accessify.com/about-accessify.asp">Accessify.com</a>, a site aimed at helping webmasters build websites that are accessible to everyone (which is also under a Creative Commons license). They offer <a href="http://www.accessify.com/articles/default.asp">articles</a> and <a href="http://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/default.asp">tools</a> to help you attain Bobby and Section 508 compliance with your sites.</p>
