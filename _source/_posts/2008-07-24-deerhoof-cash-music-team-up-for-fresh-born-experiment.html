<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">One of my favorite bands, <a href="http://deerhoof.killrockstars.com/">Deerhoof</a>, has teamed up with innovative media company <a href="http://cashmusic.org/">CASH Music</a> (we've talked about CASH's great work <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7896">here</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8089">here</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8415">here</a>) for a very interesting project. In a sly nod to the ubiquity of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN1126044820080712?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">pre-release music leaks</a>, the group has issued the <a href="http://deerhoof.cashmusic.org/">sheet music for its upcoming single "Fresh Born"</a> under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license in advance of the October release of <em>Offend Maggie, </em>the band's new album on <a href="http://www.killrockstars.com/">Kill Rock Stars</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It's a neat experiment in encouraging interactivity: Deerhoof's recorded version of "Fresh Born" isn't even available yet, but there are already several great recordings of the song - all made by other people - floating around online. Visit the <a href="http://deerhoof.cashmusic.org/">CASH site</a> for the most up-to-date collection of links to versions of the song. Lucas Gonze has made the music <a href="http://gonze.com/blog/2008/07/23/deerhoof-offend-maggie/">easier to work with digitally</a> by retranscribing it with music notation software. Also, be sure to check out New York public radio station WNYC's cool <a href="http://blogs.wnyc.org/culture/2008/07/21/deerhoof-fans-get-first-look-at-leaked-song/">video</a> of Deerhoof fans using their sight-reading abilities to collaboratively create a rendition of the song.</p>
