<p>There are over half a billion pieces of Creative Commons&#8211;licensed content in the world. That&#8217;s an impressive number, but it only hints at how powerful and widespread CC licenses have become. The real impact is in the stories of how people like you use CC licenses. When you use a CC-licensed photo in a presentation or share your latest song under CC, you&#8217;re a part of the story of CC&#8217;s impact in the world. We&#8217;re proud to share in this amazing journey with you.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re excited to launch <a href="http://teamopen.cc/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog1&utm_medium=blog">Team Open</a>, a new initiative of our staff and community. We&#8217;ve been spending the past few months talking to the CC community, looking for its favorite stories of how CC licenses benefit real people. You&#8217;ll meet a young scientist fighting cancer with free research, an entrepreneur who&#8217;s putting the <em>public</em> back in <em>public domain</em>, and a quirky musician who&#8217;s built his career on giving music away. We hope these stories inspire you, and we hope you feel inspired to share them with your friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>We're also launching our <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog1&utm_medium=blog">annual fundraising campaign</a> today. We have some cool giveaways this year, including a Team Open t-shirt and set of trading cards. To make it fun, we&#8217;re setting a little goal for ourselves. We'd like to see 600 donors by January. We'll be keeping you up-to-date on our progress via <a href="//twitter.com/creativecommons">Twitter</a> and <a href="//facebook.com/creativecommons">Facebook</a>. If Creative Commons is important to you but you've never made a donation, this could be the day!</p>
<p>CC is more than a license to share; it&#8217;s a license for all of us to create a better world.</p>
