<p><img src="img/ccmixter.jpg" alt="ccmixter" title="ccmixter" width="240" height="240" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />This Monday, we began a  guest curation series at our <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/">Free Music Archive portal</a>. Rather than attempt to distill the vast landscape of CC-licensed music on our own, we thought it better to reach out to those on the ground working to support and expose these type of artists in their given communities. What better way to start then with a <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/ccMixter_Above_Ground_Collection">selection of tracks</a> from <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> admin/developer/mentor <a href="http://fourstones.net/">Victor Stone</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For all the activism in the Open Music movement, nothing pushes the ball forward like brilliant, evocative music. While there is plenty of underground music of all sub-genres at ccMixter, there is also a growing collection of mainstream, above-ground producers who understand the value of sharing as a means of boosting their own creativity along with their exposure.

<p>You can listen and download Victor's full playlist at the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/ccMixter_Above_Ground_Collection">FMA</a> and <a href="http://ccmixter.org/playlist/browse/6260">ccMixter</a> - titled <em>Above Ground Collection</em>, it is brimming with excellent music from producers with "an ear for the popular without sacrificing artistry."</p>
