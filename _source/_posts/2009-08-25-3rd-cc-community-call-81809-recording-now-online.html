<p>We hosted our third community conference call last Tuesday, August 18. Donors were invited to join members of CC's staff and board, including CEO <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board#22">Joi Ito</a> and new Board Member <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board#10">Glenn Otis Brown</a>, to hear updates from CC's most recent board meeting, which included an overview of the steps we are taking to develop CC as a global organization, as well as progress on consolidating around the core Creative Commons brand. We also took questions and comments from participants. The call was a great success and a valuable opportunity to reach out to and connect with our supporters; we will continue to host community conference calls on a quarterly basis, and anyone <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">giving $300 or more</a> will be invited to take part.</p>
<p>An audio recording of the call is <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/CcCommunityCall-Q32009">now available online</a>. Thanks to everyone who participated, and as always, we would like to extend a big thank you to all members of our community for your continued support!</p>
