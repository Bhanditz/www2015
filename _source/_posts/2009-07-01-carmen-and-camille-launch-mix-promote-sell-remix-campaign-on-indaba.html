<p>Twin sister pop-rock act <a href="http://www.carmenandcamille.com/">Carmen and Camille</a> recently launched a very cool <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/contests/show/carmenandcamille">CC remix project</a> with Indaba Music. They've made the audio stems from their previously unreleased song â€œShine 4Uâ€ available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>, and are encouraging people to use them in new songs. Since the stems are under CC's most permissive license, you're free to not only share but also sell and commercially license your remix, as long as you give the duo credit for supplying the source material.</p>
<p>The sisters, whose music has been featured on MTV's <em>TRL</em> and who have licensed many of their tracks to shows such as <em>The Hills</em>, worked closely with Indaba on the project. Says vocalist/guitarist Camille, in the project's press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I think what makes us most excited about the outcome of this campaign is getting to hear our song redone in many different ways. We can't wait to hear what people can add to the track. And the new versions of the song may bring us new fans that it would have taken us a long time to reach, which is great." </p></blockquote>
<p>We think these two have the right idea!</p>
<p>Upload your remix to Indaba Music through July 21st, 2009. Winners will be announced on August 14th; prizes include Camel Audio software, Sennheiser headphones, and pro memberships to Indaba Music.</p>
<p>Indaba tells us that entries are currently at the rate of about 1,000 per week, which means there's a huge amount of music being created that will be available for all kinds of uses under the CC license that Cameron and Camille chose. We'd love to hear from anyone who ends up selling or commercially licensing their remix - if this applies to you, please shoot us a note at press@creativecommons.org.</p>
