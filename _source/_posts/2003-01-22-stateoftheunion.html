<p><a href="http://www.publicampaign.org">Public Campaign</a>, a campaign-finance reform advocacy group, made its "State of the Union" <a href="http://www.publicampaign.org/stateoftheunion/">poster</a> available under a Creative Commons license on its website today.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.publicampaign.org/stateoftheunion/images/700pixels.jpg">image</a> features the president of the United States making a State of the Union address --  not to the houses of Congress, but to the trading floors of a stock exchange.  It's a great example of the ever-growing importance of our rip-mix-burn culture to politics and art. </p>
<p>The president will give this year's address next week.</p></p>
