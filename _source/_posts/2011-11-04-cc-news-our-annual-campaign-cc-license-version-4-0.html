			<strong>You Are the Power of Open: 2011 Creative Commons Annual Campaign</strong></p>
<p>
			Last week we launched our Annual Campaign. Please join us in powering the future of openness! In addition to fueling the activities below, Creative Commons relies on donations to build and constantly improve the technical and legal tools that enable openness to flourish. The future of openness is bright, but ensuring that future requires urgent and sustained effort. CC is continuing to improve the usefulness of our licenses and helping even more artists, institutions and governments share their works. We are reaching a critical mass and need your support now more than ever. <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1111&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">Donate now</a>, or read <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29993?utm_campaign=newsletter_1111&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">more</a>.</p>

			<strong><span class="row-title">Copyright Experts Discuss CC License Version 4.0 at the Global&nbsp;Summit</span> </strong></p>
<p>
			The Creative Commons 2011 Global Summit was a remarkable success, bringing together CC affiliates, board, staff, alumni, friends and stakeholders from around the world. Among the ~300 attendees was an impressive array of legal experts. Collectively, these experts brought diversity and depth of legal expertise and experience to every facet of the Summit, including knowledge of copyright policy across the government, education, science, culture, and foundation sectors. We designed the Summit&rsquo;s legal sessions to leverage this expertise to discuss our core license suite and the 4.0 license versioning process.

		<strong>Blackboard to add support for CC Attribution</strong></p>
<p>
			Blackboard, the popular Learning Management System (LMS), has announced that they will build in support for CC licensing, specifically enabling instructors the ability to publish and share their course materials under the CC Attribution (CC BY) license. Cable Green, CC&rsquo;s Director of Global Learning, notes, &ldquo;The core part of any OER is an open license, and Blackboard has shown its leadership by empowering instructors to share so others can revise, reuse, remix and redistribute their courses.&rdquo; Read <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/29633?utm_campaign=newsletter_1111&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">more</a>.</p>
