<p><a href="http://www.makezine.com/">MAKE</a> (which is, incidentally, one of the coolest magazines around) is hosting the <a href="http://makezine.com/faire/movies/">MAKE: Movies</a> film festival as part of the <a href="http://makezine.com/faire/">Maker Faire</a>, taking place on April 22 and 23 at the <a href="http://www.sanmateoexpo.org/">San Mateo Fairgrounds</a>. You've got a few more days (until Wednesday, April 12) to submit your CC-licensed project demo videos, DIY tech documentaries, and how-to clips. Need music that you can use noncommercially in your entry? Check out one of the sites indexed on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/">audio page</a>.</p>
