<p>Gina Trapani and Adam Pash are editors at Lifehacker, but over the last couple of months they've been penning (wiki-ying?) a guide to Google Wave. The preview edition of The Complete Guide to Google Wave will be available for purchase as a DRM-free PDF in November of 2009, and the first edition will debut in January as both a PDF and a softcover print book, with new editions to follow throughout 2010.  </p>
<p>But what's great is that Trapani and Pash have authored and collaborated on the book using MediaWiki and are releasing its content under our Attribution-ShareAlike license. This means its content is not only compatible with Wikipedia (allowing it to be imported to and exported from the encyclopedia), but also free to share, sell, and reproduce. </p>
