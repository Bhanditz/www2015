<p>This past weekend, our very own Jon Phillips had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://pixelodeonfest.com/">The First Annual Pixelodeon Festival</a>, an independent video festival that specifically celebrates global online video. From <a href="http://newteevee.com/2007/06/11/web-video-moves-and-shakes-at-pixelodeon/">NewTeeVee</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While much of the discussion focused on how to make a business out of producing video content for online distribution, Creative Commons Jon Phillipsâ€™ presentation on new ways to think about copyright reminded me that it was ultimately a celebration of new tools and ideas for people making motion pictures online.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jon was also interviewed by <a href="http://ryanishungry.com/">Ryan is Hungry</a>, a wonderful videoblog that focuses on the environment and sustainability (check out <a href="http://ryanishungry.com/2007/06/07/jon-phillips-creative-commons-guru/" title="Ryan is Hungry &gt; Jon Phillips Interview">the video here</a>). In the interview, Jon goes into detail concerning CC's mission as a whole and, more specifically, how CC and CC licenses pertain to vloggers. The folks at RIH draw a comparison between CC's mission in relation to media development and the motivation behind sustainable living, a wonderful analogy that I haven't previously thought of before.</p>
<p>You can check out a myriad of pictures from the festival <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/pixelodeon/pool/">here</a> (including <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/karmagrrrl/540344154/in/pool-pixelodeon/" title="Flickr &gt; Jon and a big CC logo">this wonderfully big CC logo</a>). Similarly, you can see/download Jon's presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rejon/phillips-remix-cycle-pixelodeon-2007">here</a>, via the spectacular <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">slideshare.net</a> (which we have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7452">previously profiled</a>).</p>
