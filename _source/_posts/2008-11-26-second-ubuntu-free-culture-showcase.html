<p>After the great success of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8690">first Ubuntu FreeCulture Showcase</a> just 4 months ago the great people at Ubuntu have opened up the door for submissions for <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase">the latest Showcase</a>.  The Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase is a way to show off the high-quality creativeness of the Free/Open Source community.</p>

<p>The winners of the competition are given more than just bragging rights as well.  As Jono Bacon, Community Manager for Ubuntu, has put it in <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1427">his announcement</a>, "with each development cycle we present the opportunity for any Free Culture artist to put their work in front of millions of Ubuntu users around the world."  That is millions of new eyeballs and ears to experience your creative work.  The deadline for submissions is February 6th, 2009 so get to work on your submission now!</p>
<p>Also, this time around the competition is not limited to only music and video as they have added the Image category to the mix.  The image can be any type of photography or computer generated still art.</p>
<p>All submissions for the Showcase will be licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license.  The choice of license shows Ubuntu's commitment to the ethos of Free Software and Free Culture.

This is a really great choice on behalf of Ubuntu to use the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">BY-SA</a> license and help build the commons of free as in freedom material.</p>
