<p>Pop star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a> and her husband, rocker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Rossdale">Gavin Rossdale</a> recently welcomed a baby, Zuma Nesta Rock Rossdale, into the world. Many celebrities contract with a magazine to arrange an exclusive photo session that debuts mother with newborn. But Stefani and Rossdale took a different approach and hired their own photographer and put the photo online for the public under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND</a> license, along with some additional terms that allow all print magazines, newspapers, and blogs to use the photo - even commercially, with some restrictions. You can download a high-res version of the photo (and check out the additional terms the photo is available under) at <a href="http://www.gwenstefani.com/news/default.aspx?nid=17103">Stefani's site</a>.</p>
