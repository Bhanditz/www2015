<p>From February 8 - 10, the <a href="http://iml.usc.edu/">Institute for Multimedia Literacy</a> at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a> will be holding a phenomenal series of panels and screenings focused on DIY video in the digital age, tittled "<a href="http://www.video24-7.org/">24/7: A DIY Video Summit</a>". Topics of discussion range from the artistry and aesthetics involved in this new form of film creation to the copyright debate surrounding it. With presenters ranging from media theorist <a href="http://www.henryjenkins.org/">Henry Jenkins</a>, to documentary filmmaker/theorist <a href="http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/%7Eajuhasz/">Alexandra Juhasz</a>, to our very own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#0">Lawrence Lessig</a> (CEO) and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#22">Joichi Ito</a> (Chairman of the Board), the folks behind 24/7 have compiled an amazing list of panels and screenings for those interested in how digital video is changing our perceptions of contemporary DIY video and film.</p>
<p>Of particular note to those in the CC-community is the panel "DIY Media: The Intellectual Property Dilemma", which features <a href="http://www.benkler.org/">Yochai Benkler of Harvard Law</a>, Lawrence Lessig, and <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/fred-von-lohmann">Fred von Lohmann of EFF</a> (moderated by <a href="http://law.usc.edu/contact/contactInfo.cfm?detailID=317">Jen Urban,</a> Director of the USC Intellectual Property and Technology Law Clinic) and the plenary session "Envisioning the Future of DIY", which features Joi Ito, Benkler, Henry Jenkins, <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com/">John Seely Brown</a> and Lessig.
