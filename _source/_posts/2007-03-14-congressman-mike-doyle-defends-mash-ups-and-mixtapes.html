<p><a href="http://www.house.gov/doyle/news.shtml">Congressman Mike Doyle</a> gave a great speech about mash-up artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Talk_(musician)">Girl Talk</a> and mixtape king <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Drama">DJ Drama</a> as part of last week's <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/cmte_mtgs/110-ti_hrg.030707.future_radio.shtml">Future of Radio</a> congressional hearing. <a href="http://463.blogs.com/the_463/2007/03/perhaps_the_coo.html">The 463</a> has the transcript and some teriffic analysis; <a href="http://splashcastmedia.com/us-rep-defends-mixtapes-and-mashups-on-floor-of-congress">SplashCast</a> has the must-see video.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"I hope that everyone involved will take a step back and ask themselves if mash-ups and mixtapes are really different or if it's the same as Paul McCartney admitting that he nicked a Chuck Berry bass-riff and used it on the Beatles hit 'I Saw Her Standing There.'</em></p>
<p><em>"Maybe it is.  And, maybe Drama violated some clear bright lines.  Or, maybe mixtapes are a powerful tool.  And, maybe mash-ups are transformative new art that expands the consumers experience and doesn't compete with what an artist has made available on iTunes or at the CD store.  And, I don't think Sir Paul asked for permission to borrow that bass line, but every time I listen to that song, I'm a little better off for him having done so."</em></p></blockquote>
