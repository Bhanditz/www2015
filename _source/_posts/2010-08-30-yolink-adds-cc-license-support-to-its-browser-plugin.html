<p><a href="http://www.yolink.com/">yolink</a>, "a next-generation search technology," has added CC license support to its updated <a href="http://www.yolink.com/yolink/browser_plugin/">browser plugin</a>. yolink's browser plugin allows you to quickly scan your search results by specific key terms, effectively simplifying your more complex or advanced searches. Once you've found a relevant article, you can then share it with others via social media sites or a Google doc---all through the browser plugin window. The plugin has added CC license support, which means if you start a document with CC licensed site content the license will be retained and displayed in the doc.</p>
<p>For example, say I run a Google search on "Creative Commons". Via the yolink browser plugin, I quickly scan the Google results for the Wikipedia article. If I want to start a Google doc with a particular passage, I don't have to visit the Wikipedia page to manually copy and paste it---I can simply click on the check box next to the text I want and create a Google doc, all within the plugin window. yolink will automatically create a Google doc with the selected text and paste in the CC license info. See:</p>
