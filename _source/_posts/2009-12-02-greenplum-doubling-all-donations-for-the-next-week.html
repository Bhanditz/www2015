We're entering the final weeks of our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">2009 fundraising campaign</a>, and if you have yet to make a gift to CC (or even if you have!) now is the time to do so because any amount you give will automatically be doubled by <a href="http://www.greenplum.com/">Greenplum</a>! Give today and Greenplum will generously <strong> match every donation dollar for dollar </strong> for the next week - up to $5,000! <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">Donate now</a></strong> to help us meet their challenge!</p>
<p>Formed in 2003, Greenplum is led by pioneers in database systems, data warehousing, supercomputing, Internet performance acceleration and open source. With technical and business leaders from large-scale computing companies like Amazon, eBay and Yahoo, and database companies including Oracle, Informix, Teradata, Netezza, Microsoft and Tandem, Greenplum is tapping the best minds in the business to deliver the next-generation of data warehousing and analytics. Greenplum deeply understands the importance of the internet to create digital tools for the 21st century, and we're delighted to have them as a corporate sponsor of our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">campaign</a>!</p>
