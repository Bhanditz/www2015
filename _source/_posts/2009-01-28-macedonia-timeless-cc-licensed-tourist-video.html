There is nothing new about these sort of videos being produced, but what is novel is that the video is being released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.5/mk/">CC BY-ND license</a>, a decision that encourages the legal sharing of the video.</p>
<p>If the point of <em>Macedonia Timeless</em> is to drive tourism to Macedonia, then licensing the content in a way that allows legal re-posting shows foresight - fans of the video can upload it to whatever video sharing site they like as long as the provide proper attribution. You can watch the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmQMEJPJ_Q0&amp;eurl=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/25/macedonia-timeless/&amp;feature=player_embedded">YouTube</a> or download it <a href="http://www.macedonia-timeless.com/Links/Downloads.aspx">here</a>. Be sure to read Global  Voices' <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/25/macedonia-timeless/">nice analysis</a> of the video as well, which touches upon a variety of issues beyond CC licensing.</p>
