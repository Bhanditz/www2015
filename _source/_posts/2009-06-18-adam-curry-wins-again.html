<strong>Adam Curry wins again!</strong><br />
by Paul Keller</p>
<p>In 2006 <a href="http://www.curry.com">Adam Curry</a> initiated and won the <a href="http://creativecommons.nl/2006/03/10/curry-wint-zaak-creative-commons/">first ever lawsuit centering around the use of a Creative Commons licensed work</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5823">English</a>). Back then the Dutch gossip-mag 'weekend' had published photos from Curry's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamc1999/">flickr account</a> without asking Curry for permission and the Amsterdam court of first instance decided that this use was explicitly prohibited by the non-commercial condition of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license</a> that Curry uses for his Flickr pictures.</p>
<p>One would assume that other gossip-mags would learn from this and refrain from using photos from Adam's Flickr stream, but exactly that happened 2 weeks ago when '<a href="http://www.telegraaf.nl/prive/?cid=rprive">PrivÃ©</a>' used another <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamc1999/3417638514/">picture</a> to illustrate an article without Adam permission. As in the previous case Adam immediately reacted, this time by demanding that the publisher of PrivÃ© pay him a compensation for the unauthorized use or he would take them to court. Back then Adam wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of taking them directly to court I added twist this time, and gave them the option of paying 5000 euros directly to the War Child Foundation and my legal costs. Failure to comply by June 2nd and I will take them to court. It's national news, lead story on the 6:30 news and all that good stuff :)</p>
<p>According to a public response from the magazine's editor, they will 'see me in court' as they believe they have 'fair use' rights because of the picture's 'news value'. Pretty funny coming from a gossip rag.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the deadline set by Curry passed without an official reaction from PrivÃ© it turns out that the defiant reaction form the magazines editor was not worth the <a href="http://www.ad.nl/cultuurenshow/3254384/Adam_Curry_wil_geld_van_Priv_om_Flickrfoto.html">paper it was printed on</a>. Today Adam received a mail from from his lawyers indicating that PrivÃ© has settled along the terms provided by Curry in order to avoid the court hearing that was scheduled for the 23rd of June [translation from <a href="http://creativecommons.nl/2009/06/18/adam-curry-wint-opnieuw-voor-creative-commons/">Dutch original</a> by Creative Commons Netherlands]:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Adam,<br />
the conflict between Telegraaf Tijdschriften Groep ("TTG"), the publishers of among others PrivÃ© and yourself has been settled in your favor.</p>
<p>TTG wil pay you an amount of compensation and TTG has signed a declaration  (backed up by a penalty)  that in the future they will no more infringe on copyrights held by Adam Curry  in photos published by him on www.flickr.com. You will donate the compensation received to Warchild and STOP AIDS NOW!.</p>
<p>Given the above, the court hearing scheduled for the 23rd of july will not take place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Creative Commons congratulates Adam Curry with this victory that once again illustrates that when necessary the Creative Commons licenses offer enough legal protection against unauthorized used of the licensed works. Thanks again Adam!</p>
