<p>A little over two weeks ago, the very first <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7545">CC Salon London</a> took place with great success. A slew on interesting presentations and good times filled the night with a last-minute presentation of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7540">Where Are The Joneses?</a> capping things off nicely. For those not in the London area, you can read about the night's festivities and catch video of Tom Reynold's presentation <a href="http://www.ccsalon-london.org.uk/2007/07/14/tom-reynolds-video-and-the-july-salon/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In even better news, CC Salon London will be back once again at 6.30 on Thursday the 26th of July at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7540">Juno</a> on Shoreditch High Street! This month will feature presentations from Paula leDieu of <a href="http://www.magiclantern.co.uk/">Magic Lantern</a>, Michela Ledwidge from <a href="http://modfilms.com/">Modfilms</a>, and live music from <a href="http://www.calendarsongs.com/">Calendargirl/Calendarsongs</a>. You can RSVP (although none is required) on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=2461017529">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/219503/">Upcoming</a>.</p>
