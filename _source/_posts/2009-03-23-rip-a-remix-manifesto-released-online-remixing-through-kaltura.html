<p><em><a href="http://www3.nfb.ca/webextension/rip-a-remix-manifesto/">RiP: A Remix Manifesto</a></em>, a community-driven documentary that focuses on copyright and remix culture (covered earlier <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10166">here</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9281">here</a>) is just beginning to creep out into theaters, having its <a href="http://raincitystudios.com/blogs-and-pods/jeff-traynor/us-premiere-rip-a-remix-manifesto-sxsw-2009">U.S. premier</a> last week at SXSW. While the film largely focuses on the story of Greg Gillis (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/girltalk">Girl Talk</a>) it includes interviews with a wide variety of figures, including both <a href="http://lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a> and <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctor</a>ow.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting is that the filmmakers have <a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/press/OpenSourceCinema-Chooses-Kalturas-Video-Platform-to-Power-Interactive-Video-Functionality-on-its-New-Online-Community-Developed-by-Raincity-Studios">teamed up</a> with open source video platform <a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/">Kaltura</a> (early coverage <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10751">here</a>) enabling anyone with a computer to remix the film only at <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/">opersourcecinema.org</a>. All the footage of the film is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC license</a>.</p>
