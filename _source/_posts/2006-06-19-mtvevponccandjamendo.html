<p>Jamendo CEO Laurent Kratz writes in about Under the Radar (see our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5939">previous post</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>The conference went well, the most impressive part was the closing<br />
session. This closing session was an interview of Denmark West,<br />
Executive Vice President of MTV in charge of strategy, by a reporter<br />
of CNET.</p>
<p>And guess what? When the interviewer asks what he found interesting<br />
at the conference, the answer is Jamendo and Creative Commons!</p>
<p>The interview is now on the <a href="http://undertheradarblog.com/2006/06/16/under-the-radar-interview-with-mtv-networks-2/">Under the Radar blog</a>.  Choose the first video, or watch it directly <a href="http://revver.com/video/30031/15152">at Revvr</a> (Jamendo/CC part starts 10 minutes in).</p>
