<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18952">Just five days ago we announced</a> that <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a> would be generously matching every donation dollar for dollar for the next week - up to $3,000. Well, we met that goal in record time! Thanks to everyone who donated in the past five days and had your donation doubled - for a total of $6,000 going toward our annual campaign to sustain CC!</p>
<p><strong>Many thanks to Canonical for their ongoing support of free culture and Creative Commons.</strong> </p>
<p>We still have a long way to go to reach our $500,000 goal for this year's campaign, so please <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate today</a></strong> and show your support for a culture of sharing! </p>
