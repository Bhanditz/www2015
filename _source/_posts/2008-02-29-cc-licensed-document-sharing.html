<p>For those of you looking to share documents, templates, and other digital documentation online, make sure to check out both <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a> and <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/">DocStoc</a>. Both sites have CC license implementation built in and make sharing your documents with co-workers, friends, family, and the general public a breeze. There is an immense amount of options available for both Scribd and Docstoc (read their respective FAQs <a href="http://www.scribd.com/faq">here</a> and <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/User/cmsstatic.aspx?page_id=21">here</a>) and while they are both fairly flexible, Scribd is more focused on personal documents (creative, individual, etc.) while Docstoc is oriented towards a professional (legal, business, technology, etc.) audience.</p>
