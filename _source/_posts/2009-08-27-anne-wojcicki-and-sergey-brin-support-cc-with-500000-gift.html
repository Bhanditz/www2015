<p>Creative Commons is honored to have received an incredibly generous gift of $500,000 from <a href="https://www.23andme.com/ ">23andMe</a> co-founder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Wojcicki">Anne Wojcicki</a> and Google co-founder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin">Sergey Brin</a>. We are delighted that the couple recognizes the importance of Creative Commons and has decided to invest in our work to support sharing, collaboration, and the spread of knowledge and creativity. This gift - made in addition to the financial support that Google offers CC annually - will be used to support Creative Commons generally, with a focus on developing our <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science Commons</a> project, which Wojcicki and Brin are particularly excited about.</p>
<p>Today's challenging economic climate has made it difficult for nonprofit organizations like Creative Commons to raise funds, making Wojcicki and Brin's wonderful gift all the more appreciated. CC is busier than ever - we're working with artists, scientists, educators, students, programmers, entrepreneurs, companies, universities, governments, and cultural institutions around the world to increase sharing and improve collaboration in ways that benefit all parts of society. As a nonprofit, we simply couldn't do this work without the generous support of people like Wojcicki and Brin, as well as the other private donors, foundations, and corporations that enable Creative Commons to operate. For information about support for Creative Commons - including how you can get involved - please visit <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/">https://support.creativecommons.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to Ms. Wojcicki and Mr. Brin, from the Creative Commons staff, board, and community. We are very happy to have your support.</p>
