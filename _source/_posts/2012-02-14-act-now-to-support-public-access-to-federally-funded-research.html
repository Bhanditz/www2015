<p>Last week the Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA) was reintroduced with bipartisan support in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/issues/frpaa/FRPAAReintroduced2012.shtml">According to SPARC</a>, the bill would â€œrequire federal agencies to provide the public with online access to articles reporting on the results of the United Statesâ€™ $60 billion in publicly funded research no later than six months after publication in a peer-reviewed journal.â€ If passed, the legislation would extend the current <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">NIH Public Access Policy</a> (with a shorter embargo) to other US government-funded research, including agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and others. FRPAA was first introduced in 2006. </p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31184">Research Works Act</a>, FRPAA would ensure that the public has access to the important scientific and scholarly research that it pays for. Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/31283">recently wrote</a> to the White House asking that taxpayer funded research be made available online to the public immediately, free-of-cost, and ideally under an open license that communicates broad downstream use rights, such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>. While FRPAA--like the NIH Public Access Policy before it--does not require the application of open licenses to the scientific research outputs funded with federal tax dollars, it is a crucial step toward increasing public access to research. </p>
<p>SPARC has issued an <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/issues/frpaa/frpaa_action/FRPAA2012.shtml">action alert</a>, and <strong>there are <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/issues/frpaa/frpaa_action/FRPAA2012.shtml#Act">several specific actions</a> you can take in support of FRPAA</strong>. On this <a href="http://blog.soros.org/2012/02/ten-years-on-researchers-embrace-open-access/">10th anniversary of the Budapest Open Access Initiative</a>, please voice your support that the public needs and deserves access to the research it paid for and upon which its education depends.</p>
