<p>We're a bit late jumping on this one but in case you missed it the first time (like us) be sure to check out <a href="http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/">FontStruct</a>, a free font-building tool that allows you to build your own fonts online and subsequently generate them as a high-quality TrueType fonts. While this in itself provides hours of bizarrely satisfying enjoyment (read a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2192535/?from=rss">nice Slate article on why</a>), FontStruct is of particular note in that all fonts created are released under a CC license of the creator's choosing. </p>
<p>Although creators can choose to keep their fonts private, most do not - by incorporating CC licences and a ethos of sharing, FontStruct has built a community of rabid users around a seemingly obscure hobby where ideas are exchanged fluidly and modifications achieved easily. It should also be noted that FontStruct have an <a href="http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/faq/licensing_legal_questions/an_overview_of_licensing">exemplary clear explanation</a> of what permissions different CC licences give and retain, a major plus for any site looking to incorporate CC-licensing into their UI.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The Open Font Library is a similar site that allows users to upload fonts to release under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">CC Public Domain Declaration</a> - also home of the famous <a href="http://openfontlibrary.org/media/files/jkottke/218">silkscreen font</a>.</p>
