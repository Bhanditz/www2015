<p>One venue for the advancement of Open Educational Resources (OER) is through policy change at the local, state, federal, and international levels. In addition to a new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">Education landing page</a> and an <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_and_Open_Educational_Resources">OER portal</a> that explains Creative Commons' role as the legal and technical  infrastructure behind OER, CC has been conducting a series of interviews to help clarify some of the challenges and opportunities of OER in today's education landscape. We caught up with Karen Fasimpaur, a blogger, author, creator of the <a href="http://dictionary.k12opened.com/">Kids Open Dictionary</a>, and co-founder of <a href="http://www.k12opened.com/">K12 Open Ed</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You run a small educational technology company. Can you  briefly explain your business and how it relates to OER? Can you describe your past work and how it's lead to what you're doing now? </strong></p>
<p>For almost 10 years, our company, <a href="http://k12handhelds.com/">K12 Handhelds</a>, has worked with schools to integrate mobile technology into the curriculum. That work includes professional development, curriculum development, and coaching and mentoring to help facilitate differentiation of instruction, which is a key to reversing the engagement and achievement gaps that challenge our schools today. In the course of that work, I discovered open resources as a solution to several issues. The biggest was that in trying to customize curriculum resources (textbooks, etc.) for use on mobile devices and use with a variety of learners, we have always had difficulty with traditional proprietary content. In some cases, publishers wouldnâ€™t extend rights for us to do this for schools. In other cases, when we were allowed to do this, the technical work required was expensive and time consuming due to proprietary formats. OER has been a great solution to this.</p>
<p>In addition, we work with teachers and students to create multimedia products, such as podcasts, web sites, multimedia book reports, etc. I always try to make sure students (and teachers) understand copyright and what is legal to use and what is not. Before open resources, it was a challenge to find resources that  students could use legally, especially when they want to publish to the Internet. Now, with so much great content licensed under CC and other open licenses, the skyâ€™s the limit. Students love using this content and learning about copyright and open resources.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I have come to really appreciate the philosophy of OER. The K-12 education community is naturally inclined to share, so OER really makes sense in so many ways.</p>
<p><strong>You've <a href="http://www.k12opened.com/blog/archives/238">written extensively</a> on your blog about the potential for cost savings with OER. A lot of policymakers and champions of "open" rely on a cost-savings argument--not surprising, given the state of the economy over the past few years. Can OER save money and how should this be situated within the larger case for OER? </strong></p>
<p>I do think that OER can help cut costs, though OER is certainly not â€œfreeâ€ in the sense of not costing anything to develop. Particularly in K-12, where many high quality OER are developed by highly specialized content experts (much like traditional textbooks), there is a cost to do so. Where OER can save cost though is through cost sharing, electronic distribution, and better leveraging of resources. With the current state budget crises, many federal and state policymakers are looking to OER as a partial solution to funding challenges. In particular, I believe that all publicly funded materials development should require an open license â€“ that just makes good sense in terms of use of public funds.</p>
<p>Perhaps, even more importantly in K-12, reform of the traditional core curriculum adoption and purchasing systems, can result in cost savings to schools. Doing things like unbundling textbook and ancillary purchases, allowing flexibility in how instructional materials funds are spent, and encouraging more collaborative participation in the development process are all important.</p>
<p>The most important thing about OER is not that it saves money in the short term, but that it is beneficial to learning by allowing more customization and differentiation. Ultimately, that will also save money by allowing schools to spend funds on the content and services that best serve their students and by improving student engagement and achievement.</p>
<p><strong>A substantial concern around supporting open educational resources is the impression that the OER model, which releases content for free under an open license, will turn the traditional commercial publishing model on its head, especially within the textbook industry. At the same time, startups like Flat World Knowledge have demonstrated viable business models around OER, and that could benefit digital textbook adoption initiatives. How can we encourage new business models around OER, and what is the future of the publishing industry?</strong></p>
<p>The traditional publishing industry has been struggling over the last few years and, like most of our world, is facing change. The industry needs to be more responsive to customer needs and to help facilitate more flexibility in how schools provide instructional materials. Open educational resources is one of they many factors that will likely help bring this about.</p>
<p>Having worked in both commercial textbook and software publishing myself, I understand the business challenges and believe that there are exciting new business models around OER. In particular, income can be generated around customization services, professional development, and premium add-ons. This not only gives publishers a sustainable profit model, but it allows schools to shift spending from expensive, proprietary textbooks to customized services packages in order to improve learning.</p>
<p>There will always be a role for the commercial publishing industry, and I hope that there will be more conversations with the OER community to find ways we can collaborate for the benefit of teachers and learners.</p>
<p><strong>There is much discussion around what "open" means, and sometimes related terms are used, such as free/freely available/open source/digital/online. How do you feel about these differences in terminology, and what do you think is the best path forward for the OER movement? </strong></p>
<p>The discussion of what â€œopenâ€ means can sound like tiresome semantics, but it is really important. To me, "open" means that materials can be used, adapted, and redistributed freely by anyone. "Open" does not mean simply free or digital. There are many educational resources that are free and digital, but proprietary, and those resources donâ€™t have the instructional benefits of OER.</p>
<p>The OER movement would be well-served by getting this message out to educators. In presenting to groups of educators across the country, I find that it is an easy message for people to understand and that it is very well received by policymakers, administrators, and teachers, but unfortunately are not familiar with OER right now.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the role of Creative Commons within the OER movement? How can CC help?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Creative Commons has been a tremendous leader and mover in the OER movement. Without the simple-to-understand CC licenses and all the great open content that CC has helped make available to the world, OER wouldnâ€™t be as strong as it is. In the future, Creative Commons can continue to help by getting the word out about open content and CC licenses to  encourage more and more people to use these resources and to license their own work that way.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping up, what does a successful teaching and learning environment implementing the power of OER "look like"? Do you have any lingering thoughts â€” worries, hopes, predictions?</strong></p>
<p>Successful teaching and learning, with or without OER, includes differentiated learning opportunities, high engagement, and active participatory environments. While OER is not necessary to these, they certainly greatly facilitate this kind of environment. I believe that OER can really drive a powerful new model of learning. My worries for the future of OER are that the powerful commercial publishing lobby will fight OER adoption and that the word will be slow to get out to teachers about the power of this tool set. My hopes are that every teacher and learner will experience the power of differentiated instruction and see how OER can help enliven their learning experience. My predictions are that OER will change traditional publishing models; that printed, static textbooks will be a thing of the past relatively soon; and that change will be the only constant.</p>
