<p>That means "very good" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catal%e0">Catalan</a>. I was just browsing through the weblog subscriptions available in NetNewsWire tonight and came across the Catalan blog <a href="http://www.carlesbellver.com/">Sarcophilus.blog</a> and got warm fuzzies: it's available under a Creative Commons license. Half my family's Catalan. Anyone know of other <em>cc blogs catalas</em> out there?</p>
