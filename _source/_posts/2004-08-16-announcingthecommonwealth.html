A few weeks back, we unveiled a new list for discussing the intersection of Creative Commons licenses and business, dubbed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss#commonwealth">Commonwealth</a>. It's headed by Marshall Van Alstyne, an Associate Professor of Information Economics at Boston University. <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-bizcom/2004-July/000000.html">The welcome message to the list</a> details the goals for the list and plans for exploring hybrid licensing systems. If you'd like to sign up, <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-bizcom">the list's homepage</a> is the place to start.</p>
