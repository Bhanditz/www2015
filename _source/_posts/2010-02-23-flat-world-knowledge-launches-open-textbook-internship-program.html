<p><a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">Flat World Knowledge</a>, a commercial textbook publisher who uses CC licenses, aims to transform the way professors and college campuses think about textbooks through a new internship program for students. They asked for applicants <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/internship-video">last year</a>, and launched the program last week with 19 students from colleges like New York University, Ohio State University, Auburn University, Indiana University, University of Denver, University of Florida and the College of Charleston. From <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/2010/02/23/online-books-let-college-students-earn-credit%E2%80%94and-cash/">eSchool News</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"The internships, introduced this year by open textbook provider Flat World Knowledge, let sophomore and junior business students earn college credit and a little spending cash if their sales pitch convinces a professor to use web-based texts that can be reorganized and modified by chapter, sentence, or word...</p>
<p>The company has grown in the past year as the open-content movement has gained traction in higher education, buttressed by the Creative Commons license [<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>]â€”which doesnâ€™t require permission from authors to change parts of a bookâ€”and the rising cost of textbooks."</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.live-pr.com/en/students-lead-the-way-in-promoting-r1048404213.htm">press release</a> states FWK's intent to change "the college textbook market" by "taking a counter approach to the usual adversarial relationship between textbook publishers and college students." By using CC licenses, Flat World Knowledge is exploring a business model that builds on open content by offering free digital textbooks via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>, but charging for the prints and supplementary materials. Their textbooks have been used at over 400 colleges, and they received <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13677">$8 million in investments</a> last year. </p>
<p>For more on Flat World Knowledge, swing by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20499">CC Salon NYC on March 3</a> where Eric Frank, the company's founder and Chief Marketing Officer, will be talking in depth about what they do. If you're not in the area, stay tuned for some Flip camera action, which I'll link to here after the event.</p>
