<p>All of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/videos">videos on our support page</a> are now available as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora">Ogg Theora</a> files. Theora is a high quality video codec that is not patent encumbered. You can read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_format">free formats on Wikipedia</a>. As to why you should care, read Jimmy Wales' two year old blog post on <a href="http://blog.jimmywales.com/index.php/archives/2004/10/21/free-knowledge-requires-free-software-and-free-file-formats/">Free Knowledge requires Free Software and Free File Formats</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to those who bugged us about making all videos available in Theora format, most recently <a href="http://mattl.co.uk/">Matt Lee</a>, the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a>'s webmaster, and to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#51">Alex</a> for figuring out how to transcode the audio track from the last video we had yet to convert (answer: build <code><a href="http://www.v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/">ffmpeg2theora</a></code> from source with support for the needed codecs compiled in, duh!)</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/videos">Watch (any platform!)</a></p>
