<p><a href="http://www.freedomofexpression.us/"><em>Freedom of ExpressionÂ®</em>, the movie</a> (we've <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/kembrewmcleod">written about the book</a> previously) has its world premier tonight in San Francisco <a href="http://www.countercorp.org/countercorp-festival.htm#FREEDOM">at the CounterCorp Film Festival</a>. CC's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#49">Jennifer Yip</a> will be on hand for an after-film discussion.</p>
<p>Thanks to CounterCorp for keeping copyright issues in the fore. I participated in last year's discussion <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6167">following a showing of <em>Alternative Freedom</em></a>. That was good, this (year's) should be even better!</p>
