<p>This week Google threw its hat into the photo-commons ring with <a href="http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/2008/09/announcing-picasa-30-and-new-version-of.html">by announcing</a> its newly upgraded<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/home"> Picasa Web Albums service</a>. Users of Picasa now have the option to individually license their photos on the site under any of our six licenses, and can also set their profile to default to a particular one:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/picasa.jpg" title="Picasa CC Integration" class="aligncenter" width="562" height="204" /></p>
<p>Just look for <em>edit</em> button next to the "All Rights Reserved" text on the right side of any photo page, and the "Photo Usage & Licensing" section in <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/settings">your profile settings</a> (requires Google Account) to set a default license.</p>
