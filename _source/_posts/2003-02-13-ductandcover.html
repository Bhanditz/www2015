<p>In a story about the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/">U.S. Homeland Security office's</a> <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/02/10/threat.level/">recent suggestion</a> that American citizens apply plastic sheeting and duct tape to doors and windows in case of terrorist attack,  <a href="http://cnnfn.com">CNNfn</a> last night aired several scenes from <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=prelinger&collectionid=19069">"Duck and Cover,"</a> a public domain film from 1951 that famously advised American school children to take shelter beneath their desks or under blankets in case of nuclear warfare.</p>
<p>As a product of the U.S. government, "Duck and Cover" was uncopyrightable and immediately entered the public domain.  <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=prelinger&collectionid=19069">It is available for viewing online</a> at the <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/prelinger.php">Prelinger Archives</a>. </p>
<p>(Film archivist Rick Prelinger, you may recall, was our first <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/features/rick">featured commoner</a>.)</p>
