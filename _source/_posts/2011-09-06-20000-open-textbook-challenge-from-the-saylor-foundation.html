<p>The Saylor Foundation has been known for organizing <a href="http://www.saylor.org/">comprehensive curriculum</a> for popular subject areas, and licensing the resources when they can under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution license</a>. Now with the launch of its <a href="http://www.saylor.org/OTC">Open Textbook Challenge</a>, the Saylor Foundation aims to expand the amount of high-quality CC BY-licensed course materials by offering a $20,000 award for open textbooks! If a textbook is submitted and accepted for use with <a href="http://www.saylor.org/">Saylor.org</a>'s course materials, then the copyright owners receive $20,000 while the referrer receives $250. Then the textbook is re-licensed (if not already) for free and open use under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.saylor.org/OTC">http://www.saylor.org/OTC</a>. The deadline is November 1, 2011. </p>
<p>To submit a textbook with Creative Commons as the referrer, go to <a href="http://www.saylor.org/otc-form/?refcode=6">http://www.saylor.org/otc-form/?refcode=6</a>.</p>
