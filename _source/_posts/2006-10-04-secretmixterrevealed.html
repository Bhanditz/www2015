<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> member <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/porchcat">PorchCat</a> took it upon himself to create a series of events at ccMixter called "Secret Mixter" in which participants pull names out of virtual hat and are assigned to create a remix feature that artist. On a prearranged day everybody uploads their "secret remixes." The upload day for the third installation "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/thread/704">SecretMixter III: Splice Madness</a>" was yesterday and entries have already been picked up by <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/daviroque">davi roque de souza</a>'s  online mix-tape site <a href="http://www.submusica.com/musicalivre/">mÃºsicalivre</a> as "<a href="http://www.submusica.com/musicalivre/archives/41">ccMixTape 007</a>". PorchCat has threatened to hold more Secret Mixters in the near future, watch the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/forums">ccMixter forums</a> for word.</p>
<p>Will SecretMixter ever become an "official" ccMixter event? Considering I am not eligible to participate in any "official" ccMixter remixing contest or event (something I wish I would have thought of before joining the ccMixter project) the short answer is: not if I have anything to say about it.</p>
