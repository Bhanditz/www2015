<p>From the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2008/05/02/nci-use-tranche-to-share-data/">Science Commons blog</a> ...</p>
<p>"The <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a> will soon be using <a href="http://tranche.proteomecommons.org/">Tranche</a> to store and share mouse proteomic data from its Mouse Proteomic Technologies Initiative (MPTI). Tranche, a free and open source file sharing tool for scientific data, was one of the earliest testers of CC0. Many thanks to Tranche for providing us with such valuable early feedback on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCZero">CC0</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/issues/news/146670-1.html?CMP=OTC-RSS">GenomeWeb News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The MPTI collects tissue and serum measurements from mouse models of different types of cancers using analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry. Tranche researchers, along with University of Michigan researcher Philip Andrews, deposited nearly 1 terabyte of MPTI raw data into the Tranche network, where it can be shared between participating researchers.</p>
<p>The dataset is now being released in publicly accessible formats as well and is available to others in the research community. Because of the encryption used on the site, data on Tranche can be privately used by labs with access to the information until it is ready to be released to the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to everyone over at Tranche and keep up the good work!"</p>
