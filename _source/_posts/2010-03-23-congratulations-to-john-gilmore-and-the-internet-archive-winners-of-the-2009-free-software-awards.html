<p>The Free Software Foundation has <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2009-free-software-awards">announced the winners of its 2009 Free Software Awards</a>: John Gilmore (Advancement of Free Software Award) and the Internet Archive (Project of Social Benefit Award).</p>
<p>Last year <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13568">Creative Commons won the Project of Social Benefit Award</a>. As we noted then, many past free software award winners have been important participants in free culture as well -- and free software is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18878">both an inspiration for and girds the freedom</a> of the network and application layers needed for free culture to thrive.</p>
<p>This year's winners continue in that fashion, even more than past winners. John Gilmore's work in free software and free software business inspires, while his work as a co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation girds many freedoms that the knowledge layer relies upon. The Internet Archive was the most important digital repository for free cultural materials before Creative Commons existed and has been a crucial host for CC-licensed works since Creative Commons launched.</p>
<p>Congratulations and thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_%28activist%29">John Gilmore</a>, the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, and the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>
