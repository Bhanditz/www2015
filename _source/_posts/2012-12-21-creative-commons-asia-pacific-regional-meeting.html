<p>In November, representatives from CC projects in Asia Pacific nations came together in Jakarta, Indonesia. Every second year we gather in person to combine powers and plan for the future - and this time affiliates in <a href="http://www.cckorea.org/">South Korea</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.net.cn/en/">China Mainland</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.tw/">Taiwan</a>, <a href="http://hk.creativecommons.org/">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/CCMalaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="http://creativecommonssingapore.wordpress.com/">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">Australia</a>, and <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/">New Zealand</a> were hosted by <a href="http://creativecommons.or.id/">CC Indonesia</a>.</p>
<p>From legal matters to community building and sustainability, we dedicated a whole day to discussions on a range of key issues and challenges for us as individual affiliates and as part of the regional and global CC community. Some fantastic work has been going on in each jurisdiction, and 2013 could be a year of projects across borders. Strategic areas include breaking down language barriers through translation work, developing messaging for government and education sectors, and creating mentoring relationships among teams. The massive diversity in our region is actually a strength, especially for all the CC volunteers out there who might want to work on projects from another country - and all of this will inform our 2013 roadmap (to be posted online).</p>
<p>The second day was a public program for CC representatives and local speakers to run sessions on open government, open data, OER, the creative arts and general tips for beginners. CC Indonesia had a special reason to celebrate since they had recently <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.id">translated the license chooser and deeds into Bahasa Indonesian</a>, and could present on them for the first time. A <a href="http://kunci.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/budaya-bebas.pdf">translation of Lawrence Lessig's <em>Free Culture</em></a> (PDF) had also been launched in February by friends from <a href="http://kunci.or.id/">KUNCI Cultural Studies Center</a> in Yogyakarta. Followers around the country submitted reviews of the Indonesian text in the hope of snapping up one of the 15 travel scholarships to Jakarta. The CC Indonesia project is run out of <a href="http://wikimedia.or.id/wiki/Wikimedia_Indonesia">Wikimedia Foundation's Indonesian arm</a>, and so the keynote speaker <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees">Kat Walsh</a> expertly intersected both communities as the Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation and a CC Legal Council. The best moments included stand up comedian <a href="http://pandji.com/">Pandji Pragiwaksono</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LdtO1K3xnM">#SKUBYB</a> boys and girls rapping, a dance performance by CC Malaysia, <a href="http://adhitiasofyan.wordpress.com/">Adhitia Sofyan</a> on acoustic guitar and the giant dancing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondel-ondel">Ondel-ondel</a> puppets.</p>
