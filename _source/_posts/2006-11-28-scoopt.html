<p><a href="http://www.scoopt.com/">Scoopt,</a> the world's first commercial citizen journalism photography agency, has just launched <a href="http://www.scoopt.com/words/">ScooptWords</a> to help bloggers sell their content to newspapers and magazines. Within the Scoopt interface, you can easily add a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a> to your blog right alongside a Scoopt commercial badge. Use the CC license to tell people how your work can be used non-commercially; use the ScooptWords badge to let editors know that your writing can be purchased for commercial use. There's so much great blog content being created every day -- it'll be very exciting to see how it helps change the way newspapers and magazines are created.</p>
