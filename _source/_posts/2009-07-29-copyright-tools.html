<p>Last year, I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8491">blogged</a> about the <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/">Copyright Advisory Network</a>'s nifty <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/digitalslider/">digital copyright slider</a>, a tool that helps you tell whether a work is still copyrighted or whether itâ€™s in the public domain.</p>
<p>Since then, the OITP at ALA (Office for Information Technology Policy of the American Library Association) has developed and published two new tools: the <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/fairuse/">Fair Use Evaluator</a> and the <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/etool/">Exceptions for Instructors eTool</a>. From the announcement,</p>
<blockquote><p>"The <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/fairuse/">Fair Use Evaluator</a> is an online tool that can help users understand how to determine if the use of a protected work is a â€œfair use.â€ It helps users collect, organize, and document the information they may need to support a fair use claim, and  provides a time-stamped PDF document for the usersâ€™ records."</p>
<p>"The <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/etool/">Exceptions for Instructors eTool</a> guides users through the educational exceptions in U.S. copyright law, helping to explain and clarify rights and responsibilities for the performance and display of copyrighted content in traditional, distance and blended educational models."</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to these two new tools, check out the existing <a href="http://www.librarycopyright.net/108spinner/">Section 108 Spinner</a>, which "help[s] you determine whether or not a particular reproduction is covered by [Section 108] exemption" that "allows libraries & archives, under certain circumstances, to make reproductions of copyrighted materials without the permission of the copyright holder."</p>
<p>All three tools are licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY NC-SA</a>. </p>
