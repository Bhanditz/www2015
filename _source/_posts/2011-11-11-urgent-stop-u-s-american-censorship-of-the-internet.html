<p>November 16 the U.S. Congress will hold hearings on a bill that would unfairly, recklessly and capriciously enable and encourage broad censorship of the Internet in the name of suppressing distribution of works not authorized by copyright holders. As <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/e-parasite-stop-online-piracy-act">Public Knowledge aptly summarizes</a>, the "Stop Online Piracy Act" would seriously "threaten the functioning, freedom, and economic potential of the Internet" by:</p>
<ul>
<li>short-circuiting the legal system, giving rightsholders a fast-track to shutting down whole websites;
</li>
<li>creating conflicts between Domain Name System (DNS) servers, making you more vulnerable to hackers, identity theft, and cyberattacks;
</li>
<li>sanctioning government interference with the Internet, making it more censored globally.
</li>
</ul>
<p>SOPA threatens every site on Internet, but would especially harm the commons, as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/hollywood-new-war-on-software-freedom-and-internet-innovation">Electronic Frontier Foundation explains</a>, focusing on free software. The same applies to free and open projects beyond software, which often use CC licenses. While standard public licenses have lowered the costs and risks of legal sharing and collaboration, SOPA would drastically increase both the costs and risks of providing platforms for sharing and collaboration (think sites ranging from individual blogs to massive community projects such as Wikipedia, from open education repositories to Flickr and YouTube), and vaporize accessibility to huge swathes of free culture, whether because running a platform becomes too costly, or a single possibly infringing item causes an entire domain to be taken down.</p>
<p>The trend that one can plot from the DMCA (1998) to SOPA, and continued extensions and expansions of copyright and related restrictions around the world, also demonstrate the incredible importance of the commons for healthy information policy and a healthy Internet -- almost all other "IP" policy developments have been negative for society at large. The DMCA was decried by advocates of free speech and the Internet, and has over past 13 years <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca">had many harmful effects</a>. Now, in 2011, some think that the U.S. Congress <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/11/the-stop-online-piracy-act-big-contents-full-on-assault-against-the-safe-harbor.ars">'struck the right balance'</a> in 1998, while big content is dissatisfied, and with SOPA wants to ratchet the 'balance' (watch out, 2024!) much further to their short-term advantage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=sopa">Techdirt has excellent coverage of the gritty details of SOPA</a>, its ill effects, and the many constituencies alarmed (such as <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111110/00563216705/when-even-librarians-are-against-sopa.shtml">librarians</a> and <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111109/00180516690/sopa-will-have-serious-implications-sports-fans-blogs.shtml">sports fans</a>).</p>

<p>Please take action! If you aren't already <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose">sharing works under a CC license</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/">supporting our work</a>, now is a good time. Bad legislation needs to be stopped now, but over the long term, we won't stop getting new bad legislation until policymakers see broad support and amazing results from culture and other forms of knowledge that work with the Internet, rather than against it. Each work or project released under a CC license signals such support, and is an input for such results.</p>
