<p>Flickr, who <a href="http://creativecommons.org/image/flickr">we interviewed</a> last year, has reopened the <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/">area of their site devoted to Creative Commons licensed images</a>. If you're looking for a photo to drop into a collage, a report for school, or even onto a t-shirt, this is a great place to browse and search for specific licensed photos. We're also happy to see growth at Flickr has gone way beyond our expectations to nearly 1.5 million photos licensed for reuse.</p>
