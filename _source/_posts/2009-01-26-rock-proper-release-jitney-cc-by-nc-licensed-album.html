<p>Chicago-based record label <a href="http://rockproper.com/">Rock Proper</a> just added another impressive notch to their discography with today's release of Jitney's <em><a href="http://rockproper.com/featured/jitney.html">86-300</a></em>. The work of musician <a href="http://www.myspace.com/caseymeehanmusic">Casey Meehan</a>, <em>86-300</em> is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC license</a>, making the experimental rock songs therein freely sharable/remixable as long as Jitney is properly attributed and reuses are noncommercial in intent.</p>
<p>This is the second featured release from Rock Proper, who previously put out Jay Bennett's CC-licensed <a href="http://rockproper.com/featured/whatever-happened-i-apologize.html"><em>Whatever Happened I Apologize</em></a>. Of interest to those in the CC community is a <a href="http://fabakis.com/2008/12/27/dear-jay-bennett/">remix from artist Fabakis</a> who took Bennett's stripped down <em>I'll Decorate My Love</em> and transformed it into a song complete with drums, organ, electric guitar/bass, piano, and a slew of instrumental treats. All of this was legal and encouraged through the album's CC BY-NC license, and if <a href="http://fabakis.com/2008/12/27/dear-jay-bennett/#comment-642">comment sections are to be trusted</a>, might even result in an unexpected collaboration between the two artists in teh future.</p>
