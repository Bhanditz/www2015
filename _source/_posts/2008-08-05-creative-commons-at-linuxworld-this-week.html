<p>If you're in the Bay Area for the <a href="http://linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/">Linux World Expo</a>, stop by the Exhibit Hall today through Thursday and say "hi".  If you'd like to support CC, we'll have t-shirts for people donating more than $10.  We'll also be giving away stickers and other random CC paraphernalia.  Hope to see you there!</p>
