<p>This week, Andres Guadamuz (CC Costa Rica) is representing Creative Commons at the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/details.jsp?meeting_id=22206">8th Session of the Committee on Development and Intellectual Property</a> (CDIP) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).  The <a href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/mdocs/en/cdip_8/cdip_8_1_prov_2.pdf">agenda</a> [PDF] promises review of several pending recommendations as well as a discussion of future work by the CDIP. Consistent with protocol, Creative Commons prepared a statement for the opening session, which you can <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/4/49/Statement_by_Creative_Commons_to_CDIP8-1.pdf">read here</a>, as well as find CC's prior <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/WIPO">statements and presentations at the CDIP and other WIPO meetings and conferences</a>.</p>
<p>This is one in a series of engagements by Creative Commons with WIPO, which commenced in 2005 through our then-subsidiary, Creative Commons International (since renamed iCommons, and now an independent organization). During those early years, our participation at WIPO meetings was largely focused on educating WIPO members about CC as an <a href="http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/2005/educ_cr_im/educ_cr_im_05_inf1.html">alternative licensing system</a> that facilitates the distribution and reuse of materials around the world, and <a href="http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_id=103982">copyright in a digital age</a>.  In 2009, Creative Commons became an ad hoc observer to the CDIP, and has since participated directly in several meetings and conferences. As well, CC founder Lawrence Lessig <a href="http://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/2010/wipo_cr_lic_ge_10/program.html">keynoted</a> last year's WIPO conference on Facilitating Access to Culture in the Digital Age.  Prof. Lessig's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Texgpm520">remarks</a> highlighted the role that CC licenses play in enabling the sharing and reuse of creativity under the existing copyright regime, and called for the creation of a blue sky commission to consider copyright reform. </p>
<p>Our engagements with WIPO have been constructive, and educated us on the importance of being active in this and other fora where important policy discussions are taking place.  This year, Creative Commons gained permanent observer status with WIPO on the CDIP, allowing us to regularly participate in the conversations and activities that WIPO hosts.  Among other things, we plan to participate in select CDIP meetings and other activities where our experience and expertise can best be leveraged for maximum impact.</p>
