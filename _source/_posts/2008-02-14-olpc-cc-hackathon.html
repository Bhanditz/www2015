The bundle of books and educational resources we collect will be used by <a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop per Child</a> to send all over the world for children, families, and schools! And will compiling and reviewing the best college-level resources they can find for the coming re-launch of their new, community driven site!</p>
<p>On Saturday, there will be a hackathon/jam at Olin college. We hope others will create jams and barcamps and jams, and we will be adding them to the list above as they do!</p></blockquote>
