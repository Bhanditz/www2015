<p>The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> has announced a new <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/000406484_20120403130112">Open Access Policy</a>!  Effective July 1, 2012, the Open Access Policy requires that all research outputs and knowledge products published by the Bank be licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> (CC BY) as a default. Today, as the first phase of this policy is unfolded, the Bank launched a new <a href="http://openknowledge.worldbank.org/">Open Knowledge Repository</a> with more than 2,000 books, articles, reports and research papers under CC BY. President of the World Bank Group, Robert B. Zoellick, said in the <a href="http://go.worldbank.org/VOS0JQ0VK0">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Knowledge is power. Making our knowledge widely and readily available will empower others to come up with solutions to the worldâ€™s toughest problems. Our new Open Access policy is the natural evolution for a World Bank that is opening up more and more."</p></blockquote>
<p>CC BY is the most permissive Creative Commons license, allowing others to reuse, remix and redistribute works, even commercially, as long as attribution is given to the copyright holder. It is recommended for those seeking maximum dissemination and re-use of their materials while preserving copyright. We applaud the World Bank for its leadership and embracing this objective by incorporating CC as the framework for its Open Access Policy.</p>
<p>Lawrence Lessig, Board member and co-founder of Creative Commons, says,</p>
<blockquote><p>"The World Bank is not only leading by embracing the principles of open access. But by making its works available under a CC BY license, it is encouraging the widest spread of the knowledge it is producing. This work is incredibly valuable in assuring access to knowledge universally, and not just at elite universities."</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/000406484_20120403130112">Open Access Policy</a> reinforces scholarship norms. The terms require that publishing embargoes are respected and research is made available under CC BY. The Bank â€œexpects the amount of time it takes for externally published Bank content to be included in its institutional repository to diminish over time" and that the working paper versions of journal articles will be made available under CC BY without any embargo period. Additionally, the CC BY policy only applies to works published by the Bank. Works published by third party publishers will be made available in the repository under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>, with the option of CC BY should the publisher choose.</p>
<p>All of this content will be aggregated via the Open Knowledge Repository, which has been built with an eye toward maximizing interoperability, discoverability, and reusability by complying with <a href="http://dublincore.org/specifications/">Dublin Core metadata standards</a> and the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">Open Archives Initiatives protocol</a> for metadata harvesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The repository will be fully interoperable with other major international repositories such as RePEc (Research Papers in Economics),  SSRN and Economists Online. This means that the World Bank publishes just once in its own Open Knowledge Repository while its research is also "harvested" and made openly available through many other searchable online repositories, increasing the number of people able to find World Bank content."</p></blockquote>
<p>Currently, the repository contains books and papers from 2009-2012 in various fields and from all around the world, including the World Development Report and two World Bank journals, the World Bank Economic Review (WBER) and the World Bank Research Observer (WBRO). The Bank will continue to add new and old content, including those works published prior to 2009, and beginning in 2012, the Bank will include links to research-related datasets.</p>
