<p>As one of the staff members who helps answer general inquiries, I see quite a few messages that go something like, "Hey, I want to translate the license engine and deeds into my language! How do I do that?"  Up until recently, we haven't had a very good answer.  Translations were handled by our international affiliates, who are already plenty busy porting the licenses to their respective jurisdictions.  Unfortunately, the software we were using didn't have a very strong community component -- you were either a trusted translator or nothing at all.</p>
<p>Today we're able to ask you to help the affiliates by suggesting translations.  With some greatly appreciated assistance from the folks at <a href="http://translate.org.za">translate.org.za</a> we've moved our translation infrastructure to <a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/index">Pootle</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://translate.creativecommons.org">translate.creativecommons.org</a> is now the home for all our internationalization efforts.  See a language you can help with?  See a missing translation or something not quite right?  <a href="http://translate.creativecommons.org/register.html">Create an account</a> and suggest the correction.  Pootle also provides a clear overview of the <a href="http://translate.creativecommons.org/projects/cc_org/">translation status</a> for the site (hint: <strong>no</strong> language is 100% translated).  So jump in, help CC communicate in your language!</p>
