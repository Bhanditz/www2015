<p>The <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1329162">new trailer</a> for <em><a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/">RiP: A Remix Manifesto</a></em> - the Girl Talk featuring, community edited documentary that focuses on copyright and remix culture - was posted online recently and looks to be coming along excellently. The trailer features clips with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic">Greg Gillis</a>, <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>, <a href="http://lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, and a slew of other big names in the copyright/remix world. From <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/about">Opensource Cinema</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a world where ideas and culture, from â€œHappy Birthdayâ€ to Mickey Mouse, are horded under lock and key by copyright laws. Even ideas that could lead to a cure for cancer would be off-limits. Stop imagining now, because this is the world you live in. Although pop culture giants such as Walt Disney and the Rolling Stones built on the past to produce their art, the door is closing behind them.</p>
<p>I've been making a documentary for over 6 years that explores this issue: RiP: A Remix Manifesto.</p>
<p>Digital technology has opened up an unprecedented global economy of ideas. RiP explores the robber barons and revolutionaries squaring off across this new frontier as the film journeys from the hallways of Washington to the favelas of Brazil. Our central protagonist is Gregg Gillis, the Pittsburgh biomedical engineer who moonlights as Girl Talk, a mash-up artist rearranging the pop chartsâ€™ DNA with his incongruous entirely sample based songs. Along the way, I met key figures on the complexities of intellectual property in the digital era, among them Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig, culture critic Cory Doctorow, Brazilian musician and Minister of Cultural Affairs Gilberto Gil, and Jammie Thomas, the single mom successfully sued by the RIAA for illegal downloading.</p></blockquote>
<p>Footage from the film is being continuously posted to <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/consume2/raw/popular">RiP's remix site</a> for viewers to see an remix - similarly the soundtrack is being <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9281">created collaboratively</a> online by the ccMixter community.</p>
