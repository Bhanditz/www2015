<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/25/black-mustang-club-c.html">Cory Doctorow posts an interesting story about Ford car fans</a> whose fan creations were pulled from CafePress, supposedly due to trademark. Ford backed its fans. That <em>shouldn't</em> be unusual, but good for Ford for being <s>not stupid</s>smart about the matter.</p>
<p>And Ford has further demonstrated that it values and respects people who love Ford cars and trucks (again, this really ought to be just common sense) by licensing a bunch of <a href="http://ford.digitalsnippets.com/">photos of Ford cars and trucks</a> under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Attribution</a>, allowing sharing and remixing, even for commercial purposes, legally.</p>
