<p><center><strong>Creative Commons, U.S. Department of Education, Open Society Institute launch high profile video competition to highlight potential of free educational materials<br />
</strong></center><br />
Mountain View, California and Washington, D.C., -- March 5, 2012</p>
<p>Today Creative Commons, the U.S. Department of Education, and the Open Society Institute announce the launch of the <a href="http://whyopenedmatters.org">Why Open Education Matters Video Competition</a>. The competition will award cash prizes for the best short videos that explain the use and promise of free, high-quality Open Educational Resourcesâ€”or â€œOERâ€â€”and describe the benefits and opportunities these materials create for teachers, students and schools.</p>
<p>Video submissions are accepted until June 5, 2012 and winners will be announced July 18, 2012. Cash prizes, provided by the Open Society Institute, include $25,000 (first), $5,000 (second), and $1,000 (Public Choice Award). Judges include prominent artists and education experts, including Davis Guggenheim, Nina Paley, James Franco, and many others. The competition website is <a href="http://whyopenedmatters.org">whyopenedmatters.org</a> and features an introductory video by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. All entries must be shared under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan underlined various benefits of OER. Duncan, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SdrhGrcvsk">in a video that appears on the Why Open Education Matters contest website</a>, said, â€œOpen Educational Resources can not only accelerate and enrich learning; they can also substantially reduce costs for schools, families and students.â€</p>

<p>Catherine Casserly, CEO of Creative Commons, pointed out the importance of raising awareness for Open Educational Resources. â€œBoth Creative Commons and Open Educational Resources are 10 years old this year, and thereâ€™s been an amazing explosion in the amount and quality of free, openly-licensed educational content being shared online. Now is the time to push awareness of OER into the mainstream.â€</p>
<p>The launch of the Why Open Education Matters Video Competition coincides with the first annual Open Education Week (<a href="http://openeducationweek.org">openeducationweek.org</a>), which runs from March 5-10, 2012. Open Education Week is a global event that seeks to raise awareness about the benefits of free and open sharing in education. </p>
