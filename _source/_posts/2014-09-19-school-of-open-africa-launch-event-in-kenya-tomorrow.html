<p>Following on the heels of School of Open Africa launch events in Tanzania and Nigeria <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43678">last weekend</a>, School of Open Kenya is hosting its own tomorrow to kick off training for four high schools in Nairobi. </p>

<p>Called Popjam, this SOO launch event + Mozilla Maker Party will be a day-long workshop introducing high school students to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education#OER">open educational resources (OER)</a>. Students will learn how to use OER and the open web to complement their academic studies. Students from four high schools will participate: Precious Blood Secondary School, Nairobi School, Sunshine Secondary School, and State House Girls Secondary School. SOO Kenya is hosted by Jamlab, a co-creation community based in Nairobi for high school students and graduates in Africa. </p>

<h3>About Maker Party</h3>
<p><em>School of Open and Creative Commons is excited to be partnering with Mozilla to celebrate teaching and learning the web with <a href="http://party.webmaker.org/">Maker Party</a>. Through thousands of community-run events around the world, Maker Party unites educators, organizations and enthusiastic Internet users of all ages and skill levels.</p>
<p>We share Mozilla's belief that the web is a global public resource that's integral to modern life: it shapes how we learn, how we connect and how we communicate. But many of us don't understand its basic mechanics or what it means to be a citizen of the web. That's why we're supporting this global effort to teach web literacy through hands-on learning and making with Maker Party.</em></p>

<p><em>The <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a> is a global community of volunteers focused on providing free education opportunities on the meaning, application, and impact of "openness" in the digital age and its benefit to creative endeavors, education, and research. Volunteers develop and run courses, workshops, and real world training programs on topics such as Creative Commons licenses, open educational resources, and sharing creative works. The School of Open is coordinated by Creative Commons and P2PU.</em></p>
