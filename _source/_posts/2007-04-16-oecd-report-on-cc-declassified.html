<p><a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/14/38393115.pdf">Participative Web: User-Created Content</a> (pdf, 74 pages) mentions Creative Commons several times.</p>
<p>According to the foreword:</p>
<blockquote><p>This report was presented to the Working Party on the Information Economy (WPIE) in December 2006 and declassified by the Committee for Information, Computer and Communications Policy in March 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the whole world knows ... about User Generated Content and Creative Commons!</p>
<p>The document appears to contain no earth-shaking revelations, but does look like a solidly informative report.</p>
