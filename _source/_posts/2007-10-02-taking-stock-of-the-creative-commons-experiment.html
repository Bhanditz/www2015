<p>As Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7693">approaches its 5th birthday</a> it makes sense for papers to appear with titles like <em><a href="http://web.si.umich.edu/tprc/papers/2007/805/CreateCommExp.pdf">Taking Stock of the Creative Commons Experiment: Monitoring the Use of Creative Commons Licenses and Evaluating Its Implications for the Future of Creative Commons and for Copyright Law</a></em>. This paper, presented a few days ago at <a href="http://www.tprc.org/TPRC07/2007.htm">TPRC 2007</a> (though not the final version), is from Giorgos Cheliotis, Warren Chik, Ankit Guglani, Giri Kumar Tayi. It offers an expanded and extremely interesting analysis expanding on that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7551">presented by Cheliotis this summer at our annual summit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.si.umich.edu/tprc/papers/2007/805/CreateCommExp.pdf">Read the paper</a> or just skim for some neat graphs concerning CC license adoption and license mix against criteria such as region, wealth, population, and license launch date.</p>
<p>If you're in San Francisco you can ask in person about this research as Giorgos Cheliotis will be one of the presenters at <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/219905/">next week's CC Salon</a>. A full announcement for that event will be posted here soon.</p>
