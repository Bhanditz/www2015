<p>CCâ€™s <a href="../board">Board of Directors</a> met during the first day of the <a href="../weblog/entry/29237">Global Summit</a> on September 16, 2011 at the Primateâ€™s Palace in Warsaw, Poland. <a href="../weblog/entry/29109">Prof. Brian Fitzgerald</a> was appointed as a Director of the corporation and to its Audit Committee. The Board also expressed its grateful appreciation to Alek Tarkowski and the <a href="http://creativecommons.pl/">CC Poland</a> team for their excellent preparation of the Global Summit and to departing Vice President <a href="../staff#johnwilbanks">John Wilbanks</a> for his outstanding accomplishments at Science Commons. Prof. Carroll reported on the success of the recent <em>Global Congress on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest</em> noting that <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">CC affiliates</a> formed a significant portion of leading thinkers and activists in this field and pointed to the resulting <em><a href="http://infojustice.org/washington-declaration">Washington Declaration on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest</a>.</em> The Audit Committee's conflict of interest reviews were also ratified. The remainder of the meeting was dedicated to discussion of improvements to the board structure, fundraising, and strategic objectives.</p>
<p>This was the first time in six years that a CC Board meeting has been held in conjunction with an affiliate Summit event. It was a unique and immensely helpful opportunity for the Directors to make personal contacts with CC supporters and to share directly in the rich expertise and insightful perspective of the affiliate community.</p>
