<p><a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora 8</a> has implemented a great feature within the Firefox browser that makes it even easier for users to find Creative Commons-licensed materials that they can share, remix and reuse. The pull-down menu right below the main search field is a quick way to filter search results to return CC-licensed open content. Congratulations to Fedora on a great release with 8. Go <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora">here</a> to get Fedora 8 for your machine, where you can download either a full install or live media image.<a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/fedora-8-firefox-cc.jpg" title="Fedora 8 Firefox CC search"></a></p>

<p>Fedora has been a supportive partner for the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/livecontent">LiveContent</a> project, which utilizes the ability to create custom LiveCD and LiveDVD spins. Keep an eye out for more news about LiveContent <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LiveContent_2_0">2.0</a>--test runs of the new LiveDVD are in the works, and lots of eyes will be needed to look it over. In the meantime, help build the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/content_directories">Content Directories</a> by adding your favorite CC-license-powered project to it. Help build the wealth of CC-licensed media for inclusion on the LiveContent distro!</p>
