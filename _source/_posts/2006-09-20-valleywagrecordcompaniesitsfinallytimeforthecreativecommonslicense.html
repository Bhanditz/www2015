<p><a href="http://www.valleywag.com/tech/music/click-here-to-dance-record-companies-its-finally-time-for-the-creative-commons-license-201608.php">Our sentiments exactly!</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Practically every online downloading system already comes with a Digital Rights Management lock that limits its use. That same technology could mark music as "pre-approved for performance" -- a song that users can play with, dance to, re-record, and post to the Internet with impunity. YouTube could check for a simple key, much easier than whatever magic copyrighted-music-recognizer YouTube has up its sleeve.</p></blockquote>
