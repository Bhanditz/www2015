<p>Good news! In case you missed <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/2008/12/creativecommons">our very special panel at Harvard Law School</a>, we have plenty of media for you. </p>
<p>First, there's video of the entire panel up on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlW1ew_sNEk">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/interactive/events/2008/12/creativecommons">higher resolution versions are also available over at the Berkman Center</a>.</p>
<p>What makes this panel so interesting (and why you should take some time to enjoy it over the holidays) is that it offers an intimate glimpse into CC's history through the eyes of the people who were there from the beginning. Larry, Molly, Jamie and Joi recall some wonderful stories and anecdotes from the early days of CC and offer up new perspectives on where the organization should be headed. Put simply, this is a must watch if you're interested in our history.</p>
<p>Also check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/creativecommons/sets/72157611288979463/#//www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlW1ew_sNEk&feature=channel_page">my photos of the panel and reception afterwards</a>, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157611335385383/">Doc Searls also has some shots as well</a>.</p>
