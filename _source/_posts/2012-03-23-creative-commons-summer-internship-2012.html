<p>Creative Commons is once again seeking a bright, enthusiastic student to intern at its Mountain View office for ten weeks this summer. The student will have the opportunity to work with CC staff and international volunteers on various real-time projects.</p>
<p>This year, Creative Commons is looking for an intern to work on a number of specific projects in support of our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">worldwide affiliate community</a>.</p>
<p>The intern will be supervised by the Affiliate Network Coordinator and work with our remotely-based Regional Project Managers to facilitate collaborative projects among our global volunteer network and to support our regional activities more generally. Assigned tasks and projects will vary depending on skills, experience and organization needs. However, it is anticipated that over the course of the ten week period the intern will undertake tasks along the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assist with the production of educational toolkits and standardised materials on specific topics/domains</li>
<li>
Audit existing resources and materials internationally for contribution to toolkits</li>
<li>
Coordinate group translation of identified documents</li>
<li>
Recruit affiliates for working groups and coordinate activities</li>
<li>General support of affiliate communications, consultation and coordination</li>
</ul>
<p>This position would suit those with experience, qualifications or an interest in community management, communications or a similar field. Knowledge of, or involvement in, the free/open culture movement would be a plus. Other than the Affiliate Network Coordinator, the intern would primarily be interacting with internationally-based staff and volunteers, so some late night and early morning work may be required.</p>
<p>In addition to contributing to real-time work projects, the intern will be invited to participate in external meetings, staff meetings, inter-organization competitions and discussions, and potential evening events. Staff will encourage the intern to also self-organize visits to local organizations, and to find ways to connect with various community members.</p>
<p>If you are a currently enrolled student (College, Graduate level, or somewhere in between) interested in applying, please read the above description carefully and follow the instructions below.
