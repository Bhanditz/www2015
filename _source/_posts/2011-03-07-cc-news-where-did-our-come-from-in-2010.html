<p><strong>Where our $ came from in 2010</strong></p>
<p>In an exercise in transparency and graphic design, we illustrate the source of the hands that fed us, including yours. We're a nonprofit organization that happily provides our tools for free, and we rely on you, our international community of users and advocates to help us continue our work. With so many worthy causes in the world vying for your support, we are so grateful to all who have kept CC afloat and going strong for the past 8 years. We'd love to see these numbers grow, just as CC license adoption and use of our tools has grown steadily since 2002. Check out the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26576?utm_campaign=newsletter_1103&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">full visual break-down</a> of 2010 funds.</p>
<p><strong>Open Attribute, a ridiculously simple way to attribute CC-licensed works on the web</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://openattribute.com/"> </a>For evidence that CC tools are laying the groundwork for a more open web, look no further than <a href="http://openattribute.com/">Open Attribute</a>, "a suite of tools that makes it ridiculously simple for anyone to copy and paste the correct attribution for any CC licensed work.â€ The Open Attribute team (which includes our super stellar CTO Nathan Yergler) launched browser add-ons for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome last month. Thanks to the magic of CC REL, the add-ons pull the metadata around a CC-licensed work to produce a formatted attribution that users can copy and paste wherever they need to.

<p><strong>Have your own Creative Commons project? Learn how to get it funded</strong></p>
<p>We are never short on good ideas, but how many of those ideas actually turn into something tangible? Now's your chance to get serious with â€œGetting your CC project funded,â€ a free, online course set to run in April. The course consists of a series of workshops and seminars that will take you through the steps from an initial idea to having a finished project proposal for submission, including assistance in identifying and finding funding bodies and collaborations relevant for your project. You provide the idea; the course provides the guidance to turn it into a proposal that canâ€™t be refused.
