<p>A month ago, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12540">we announced</a> that <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> had surpassed 100 million CC licensed photos. In celebration of this milestone, we offered a limited number of Creative Commons CEO Joi Ito's book, <a href="http://www.freesouls.cc/">Free Souls</a>, at the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/join">$100 donation level and above</a>. There are only three copies left, so now is your chance to <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">support CC and secure a copy</a> of this beautiful limited edition book celebrating a free and open culture of sharing.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has already donated and received the book, and to all of our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">wonderful supporters</a> who make success stories like the 100 million CC licensed Flickr photos possible!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> The last copies of <em>Free Souls</em> are gone! If you'd like to support CC and buy art, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14065">Matt Jones' <em>Get Excited And Make Things</em> prints</a> are still available, or head over to the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">Support CC</a> site and make a regular donation, with regular (ultracool) CC swag available!</p>
