<p>Since Will posted a brief <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5512">survey of CC-licensed science fiction and fantasy novels</a> last month I've noticed three more exciting CC-licensed SF items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charlie Stross <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2005/08/07/#hugo-thing">won</a> the Hugo award for best novella for his CC-licensed <a href="http://www.goldengryphon.com/Stross-Concrete.html">The Concrete Jungle</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/">Orion's Arm</a> is a CC-licensed post-singularity "shared world" where authors are collaborating on fiction and games based in the shared world.</li>
<li><a href="http://nyc2123.com/">NYC 2123</a> is a CC-licensed graphic novel <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/17/cclicensed_cyberpunk.html">described on Boing Boing</a> as "a sweet little hard-boiled post-apocalyptic cyberpunk thing. It reads like Neuromancer with less flash and more computer-savvy." (More <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5571">CC-licensed comics</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Orion's Arm and NYC 2123 both use licenses that allow remixing. You got your post-apocalypse in my post-singularity!</p>
<p>All this SF is good, but don't forget science reality. Check out <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science Commons</a>. Real scientists (and you) are creating the future we'll live in...</p>
