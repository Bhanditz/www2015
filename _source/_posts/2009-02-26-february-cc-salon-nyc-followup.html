Thanks to the presenters and everyone who made it out on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=12537">Tuesday for our Salon</a> at <a href="http://www.foryourimagination.com">For Your Imagination</a>'s studio. I've posted photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/creativecommons/sets/72157614437503294/">from the event here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a minute, we'd love it if you could fill out <a href="http://creativecommons.org/salon-survey">a quick survey about the Salon here</a>. Don't worry if you've already filled one out for a previous Salon, we're always looking to improve, so don't hesitate to let us know your thoughts. </p>
<p>Couldn't make it to February's Salon? Our next one will be in mid-April, so <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/rss">subscribe to our blog and keep an eye out.</a></p>
