<p><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/03/22/mozilla-launches-firefox-4-and-delivers-a-fast-sleek-and-customizable-browsing-experience-to-more-than-400-million-users-worldwide-2/">Firefox 4 is officially released today</a> by our friends at Mozilla, and it is awesome. <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Install or upgrade now</a>.</p>
<p>In large part due to Mozilla's leadership over the years, the Open Web is in good health. Open standards and <a href="http://blog.webmproject.org/2011/03/firefox-4-bringing-webm-support-to-web.html">open formats</a> are becoming the norm. This means anyone, anywhere can develop innovative applications that will work in any modern browser, without asking anyone for permission or paying any fees.<sup>*</sup> See Mitchell Baker (chair of the Mozilla board) on <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2011/03/22/firefox-4-more-than-a-great-browser/">why Firefox is more than just a great browser</a>.</p>
<p>Note that CC Search is no longer included by default in the Firefox search bar dropdown list. This is eminently reasonable from a user experience and business perspective, about which we'll post more soon. If you want to add CC Search to your search bar, you can do so from the <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/demos/search/?beta=1&q=">CC Search beta interface</a>; feedback encouraged.</p>
<p>Congratulations and thank you to everyone at Mozilla and everyone who benefits from Mozilla's work -- that means all 2 billion people who currently have access to the net, and hopefully soon the 5 billion people who do not yet have access -- understand why <em>any</em> barrier to participation is a barrier too high.</p>
<p><small><sup>*</sup> Except where content and data are concerned; that's where Creative Commons comes in. Today let's celebrate the openness of the web at the standards/protocols/formats layer.</small></p>
