<p>On Friday, Michael Geist broke the story that <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5357/125/">the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had apparently banned use of CC-licensed music in its podcasts</a>. This seemed odd, given that the CBC's Spark podcast has long <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21741">used, promoted</a>, and done <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14390">interesting projects</a> with CC-licensed music.</p>
<p>It is always gratifying to see CC supporters (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23583">superheroes even!</a>) quickly respond -- see stories on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/10/08/cbc-agreement-with-t.html">Boing Boing</a>, <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/10/08/2346236/CBC-Bans-Use-of-Creative-Commons-Music-On-Podcasts">Slashdot</a>, and <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101008/14251511343/cbc-stops-using-creative-commons-music-over-concerns-about-commercial-vs-non-commercial-use.shtml">Techdirt</a>.</p>
<p>CBC Radio's program director responded with a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/10/08/cbc-agreement-with-t.html#comment-906362">comment</a> on several of those stories, excerpted here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The issue with our use of Creative Commons music is that a lot of our content is readily available on a multitude of platforms, some of which are deemed to be â€œcommercialâ€ in nature (e.g. streaming with pre-roll ads, or pay for download on iTunes) and currently the vast majority of the music available under a Creative Commons license prohibits commercial use.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that we continue to be in line with current Canadian copyright laws, and given the lack of a wide range of music that has a Creative Commons license allowing for commercial use, we made a decision to use music from our production library in our podcasts as this music has the proper usage rights attached.</p>
<p>Everyone can rest easy-- there are no â€œgroupsâ€ setting out to stop the use of Creative Commons music at the CBC, and we will continue to use Creative Commons licensed music, pictures etc. across a number of our non-commercial platforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is good to know that the CBC will continue to use CC-licensed works in some cases, and their explanation of why not in others. And it is true that only a minority of CC-licensed music is released under a license that permits commercial use -- for example, about <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/albums?order=ratingweek_desc&tag_idstr=&location_country=all&license_minrights_c=on">26% of the nearly 40,000 CC-licensed albums on Jamendo</a>.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5357/125/">Michael Geist</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/10/08/cbc-agreement-with-t.html#comment-906658">Cory Doctorow</a>, and many others have subsequently pointed out, CC-licensed music that does permit commercial use ought be allowed. Geist:</p>
<blockquote><p>A better approach - one that respects the choices of both artist and producer - would be to require that programs only use music with the appropriate rights, which could include some CC licenced music.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bigger picture: finding, sharing, and supporting music under CC licenses permitting commercial use</h3>
<p>Hopefully the CBC will listen to the feedback of Geist, Doctorow (both Canadians, as it happens), and others. However, the incident is a good reminder of the opportunity for music under CC licenses permitting commercial use, sites and curators that facilitate finding and sharing such music -- including letting people know about the many that do exist.</p>
<p>(Note that many musicians have chosen to release music with CC licenses containing the NonCommercial term with good reason; this post is meant to point out the opportunity for others, not a critique of those who have chosen to limit commercial use.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/albums?order=ratingweek_desc&tag_idstr=&location_country=all&license_minrights_c=on">Jamendo</a> may host the largest current collection of CC-licensed music permitting commercial use. See (and contribute to) our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Commercial_music">wiki article with tips on finding commercially usable CC-licensed music</a> for much more at sites ranging <a href="http://soundcloud.com/creativecommons">SoundCloud</a> to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Sound">Wikimedia Commons</a> to <a href="http://alpha.libre.fm/">Libre.fm</a>.</p>
<p>If you're an artist with experience sharing music, including for commercial purposes permitted under an appropriate CC license, or the developer of a site or other service for discovering, distributing, supporting such music, or otherwise add to this ecosystem, please let us know -- and thank you!</p>
