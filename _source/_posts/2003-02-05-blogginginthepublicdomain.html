<p>There's been a lot of recent talk among weblogs regarding Creative Commons licenses.   After a little healthy back-and-froth, <a href="http://www.corante.com/copyfight/">Copyfight</a> cleared up <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002467.php">some confusion over</a> its use of a Creative Commons license. <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc</a> (whom we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/features/searls">profiled</a> on this site) recently changed his blog to devote the contents to the public domain, sparking a discussion among <a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000830.html">a</a> <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002466.php">few</a> <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/000885.htm">webloggers</a> questioning the rush to license, in turn prompting <a href="http://www.yarinareth.net/caveatlector/archive/week_2003_02_02.html#e001273">others to explain their reasons</a> for doing so.  Meanwhile, the ever dutiful and thorough Bag and Baggage <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_bgbg_archive.html#90282671">asks for more opinions</a> from lawyers with weblogs.</p>
<p>For our part, we're glad to see discussion of the licenses, the hows and whys of using them in certain circumstances, and so on.   We're a community-based project, and we're of the school that the more speech, the better.  That said, if you're confused about a Creative Commons tool, please remember to visit our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/faq">FAQ</a>, or <a href="mailto:info@creativecommons.org">email</a> us.  We can't provide legal advice specific to your situation, but we can provide general information that you can use to help yourself.</p>
<p>And that's a point that bears emphasizing.  Anyone considering using a Creative Commons license should always think through all the issues involved and adopt the license with careful attention to detail.  Our tools are just that -- tools.  Our model intentionally depends on copyright holders to take responsibility for how they use those tools.   Or how they don't use them:  If you're unsure and want to keep your full copyright, fine. If you choose to allow others to re-use your work, great.</p>
