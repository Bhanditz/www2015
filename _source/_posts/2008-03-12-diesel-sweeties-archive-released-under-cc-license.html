<p>rstevens (the r is for Richard), creator of popular webcomic <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/">Diesel Sweeties</a>, <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/blog/?p=283">announced on his blog</a> that starting today he will be releasing the entire Diesel Sweeties archive for free under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">BY-NC license</a>. The archive contains close to 2,000 web comics, offering massive potential for to interesting reuses (via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/10/diesel-sweeties-coll.html">Boing Boing</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>By my calculations, DS is going to hit 2000 comics in a little under two months. April is Clangoâ€™s 8th birthday. Iâ€™d like to celebrate by releasing the entire webcomic archive for free in ten volumes. It worked for Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead- not bad company to try and keep!</p>
<p>These files will be in PDF form, available one per week for ten weeks. You can donate if so inclined, or take advantage of ten classic shirt designs @$10.99. At the end of ten weeks, I plan to release a special anniversary art book.</p>
<p>All eBooks will be released under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial license. Youâ€™re free to reformat them into .CBR, Word docs, XML, whatever you like. Youâ€™re also free to archive and share them with others for free. Theyâ€™re even small enough to email. Just donâ€™t use them commercially.</p></blockquote>
