<p>We are thrilled to relay Wired.com's <a href="http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2011/11/creative-commons/">announcement</a> that from now on all Wired.com staff-produced photos will be released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial license</a> (CC BY-NC)! Wired.com's Editor in Chief Evan Hansen says,</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œCreative Commons turns ten years old next year, and the simple idea of releasing content with â€œsome rights reservedâ€ has revolutionized online sharing and fueled a thriving remix culture. At Wired.com, weâ€™ve benefited from CC-licensed photos for years â€” thank you sharers! Now weâ€™re going to start sharing ourselves.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>We want to return the thanks to Wired.com for recognizing the power of open! Wired.com is a leader in covering the world of technology and a pioneer in commercial online publishing. We hope that others will recognize the value of both borrowing from, and contributing to, the richness of our shared commons.</p>
<p>To immediately sweeten the pot, Wired.com is celebrating their new licensing policy by releasing a CC-licensed gallery of 50 iconic photos from past stories including portraits of Steve Jobs, Woz, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Ballmer, Trent Reznor, JJ Abrams, and others. Check out Wired's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wiredphotostream/">Flickr stream</a> for high resolution formats of the photos.</p>
