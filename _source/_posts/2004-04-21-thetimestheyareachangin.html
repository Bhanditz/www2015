<p><a href="http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pressrelease.cfm?id=2137">A recent study</a> of people that download music from the internet found that 21% of the participants had also downloaded a feature film before. 9% had even downloaded a film in the past month. These are some fairly high numbers and point out that while everyone has been predicting what happened to music would eventually happen to film, it may actually come true. Hopefully the Hollywood studios pick up on the success of things like <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes Music Store</a> and provide an easy-to-use and relatively inexpensive way to download movies legally, before everyone figures out a way to pirate the stuff behind their backs.
