This week's featured content is <a href="http://www.zug.com/pranks/riaa/">a protest song at zug.com</a>. Zug.com has been producing humorous articles for almost ten years online and this protest song is part of a larger set of RIAA pranks they pulled last summer. The song has been remixed as well and they actively encourage others to share the song online to get their message across, in a humorous way.</p>
