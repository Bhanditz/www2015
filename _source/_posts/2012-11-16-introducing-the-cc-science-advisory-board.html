<p>Creative Commons has formed a new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/science/board" title="More on the SAB.">Science Advisory Board (SAB)</a> to guide its science program and to provide overall strategic vision and focus. The SAB brings legal, institutional as well as domain-specific knowledge in the use and sharing of scientific tools and data. Our SAB is made up of eminent scholars and practitioners from different disciplines and four continents who have volunteered to provide us both the domain expertise as well as regional perspective to help create a truly globally responsive program. We are grateful to <strong>Gilberto Camara</strong>, <strong>Michael Carroll</strong>, <strong>Robert Chen</strong>, <strong>Juncai Ma</strong>, <strong>Peter Murray-Rust</strong>, <strong>Mackenzie Smith</strong>, and <strong>John Wilbanks</strong> for their time and insight.</p>
<p>Creative Commons works with scientists and institutions, providing education and outreach on the right technologies and licenses to maximize legal interoperability of scientific data and tools. Since most science is both cross-discipline and cross-border, legal interoperability of data and tools facilitates collaboration, enables reproducibility and verifiability, and makes it possible to extract a higher return on investment in publicly funded scientific programs through reuse of information.</p>
