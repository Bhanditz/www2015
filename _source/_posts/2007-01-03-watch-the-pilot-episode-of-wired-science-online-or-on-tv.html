<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/"><em>WIRED Science</em></a> is a brand new television pilot from our good friends at <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/"><em>Wired</em></a>. You can <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/index.html">watch it online</a> or catch the premiere tonight on PBS. Another CC friend, <a href="http://www.davidbyrne.com/">David Byrne</a>, did the music for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHWmtpWgisM">show's opening</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Watch the Pilot Episode of <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/">WIRED Science</a></em><br />
Wednesday, January 3, 2007<br />
8:00 PM EST on PBS (Check local listings.)</strong></p>
<p>Go into the world of meteorite hunters, where space, commerce, and art intersect; travel to Yellowstone National Park, to harvest viruses that may hold the key to a technology revolution; and dive underwater to find NEEMO, NASA's extreme astronaut training program. Meet rocket belt inventors, stem cell explorers, and the developer of an electric car that goes zero-to-60 in under four seconds.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>WIRED Science </em>is one of three pilots under consideration by PBS for series development. You can weigh in on your favorite. Viewer feedback, as well as additional audience-based research, will inform PBS's decision to greenlight one pilot as the next new science series slated to premiere in Fall 2007.</p>
