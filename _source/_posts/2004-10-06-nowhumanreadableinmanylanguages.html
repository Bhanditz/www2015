<p>Due to overwhelming demand, and thanks to the work of our international project leads and tech crew, the summaries of our licenses are now available in nine different languages. Note how this is different from the iCommons process, which involves translating and adapting the licenses themselves (the lawyer-readable part of things) to various languages and legal systems. Just scroll down to the bottom of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">any Commons Deed</a> and pick the language you prefer.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/deed_trans.gif" width="440" height="39" alt="deed" style="border:1px solid black;" /></p>
<p>We've also flipped the switch for this feature on <a href="/license/">the license chooser</a>. Previously we depended on the default language of your browser, but due to requests, we have offered a way to switch to other languages. Eventually, you may very well see our entire website available in a host of languages as this project continues to spread around the globe.</p>
