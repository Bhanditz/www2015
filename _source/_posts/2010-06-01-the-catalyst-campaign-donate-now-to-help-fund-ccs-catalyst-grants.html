<p>We're thrilled today to announce the launch of the Catalyst Campaign - from now through June 30, Creative Commons is raising money to fund our recently-launched <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Grants">Catalyst Grants</a> program.</p>
<p>Catalyst Grants will make it possible for individuals and organizations to harness the power of Creative Commons. A grant might enable a group in a developing country to research how Open Educational Resources can positively impact its community. Another could support a study of entrepreneurs using Creative Commons licenses to create a new class of socially responsible businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">But we can't do it without your help.</a> Our goal is to raise $100,000 from CC supporters like you to fund the grants that will make all this possible. <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">Donate today</a> to help spread our mission of openness and innovation across all cultural and national boundaries.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the <strong><a href="http://www.milanomediterraneo.org/">Milan Chamber of Commerce</a></strong> for recognizing the importance of funding this initiative by generously donating EUR 10,000! The Milan Chamber of Commerce and its <a href="http://www.promos-milano.it/">Promos Network</a> already work to promote international collaboration and innovation and we're honored they've stepped up to jumpstart the campaign.</p>
