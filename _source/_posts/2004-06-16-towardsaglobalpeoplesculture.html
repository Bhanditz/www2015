<p><a href="http://www.wizards-of-os.org/">The Wizards of os conference</a> in Berlin proved a veritable feast for Creative Commoners around the world gathering to discuss the future of the digital commons last week.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Germany was launched on Friday with an emotional tribute by filmmaker, Michael Grob, who released his full-length feature film, <a href="http://www.freierfilm.ch/filme/052004_0887.html">CH7</a> under a CC license. Along with presentations from author, Armin Medosch and DJ, Bjoern Hartmann, a <a href="http://www.wizards-of-os.org/index.php?id=1444">"Creative Commons Summit"</a> enabled conference participants to find out more about other country projects currently in the mix.</p>
<p>Project leads from Brazil, Finland, France and South Africa talked about their experiences with the Creative Commons license porting or transposition and about local applications by authors, educators and creators. As each person spoke, we became aware of how important both the local and global processes are as each country establishes the relevance of the licenses according to the peculiarities of local law and culture, but is still intrinsically connected within the global iCommons community. There are very few international initiatives that display such tremendous unity and cooperation, and it was really positive to see how volunteers of this movement are so united towards the growth of a people's culture.</p>
<p>I have never been more proud to be a Creative Commoner than at this global celebration.</p>
