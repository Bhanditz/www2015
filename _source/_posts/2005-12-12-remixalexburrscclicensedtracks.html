<p>Lowell, MA-based zine and music publisher <a href="http://outletzine.org/">Outlet</a> is hosting a <a href="http://outletzine.org/music/alexburr/contest.php">remix contest</a> to promote <i>Neighbor Hater</i>, the new CC-licensed album by Alex Burr. From Outlet's press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>[D]ownload the raw tracks from three songs: Neighbor Hater, Throne of Blood, and Bullet Train. From there, it's all in your hands, use whatever you deem necessary to create the music that you want using the raw tracks. No holds barred, no styles banned, no limits, no rules, no guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>No limits? Sounds like fun! And, of course, don't forget to enter the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/copyrightcriminals/view/contest/about">Copyright Criminals Remix Contest</a> over at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a>.</p>
