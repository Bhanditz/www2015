<p>Grant Robinson is doing his part to make the new year un<em>common</em>ly great.  He's launched <a href="http://indieish.com/cc365/">CC:365</a>, a project/podcast to highlight a great CC licensed song every single day of the year.  Check out <a href="http://indieish.com/2006/01/01/day-1-trash80-social-silence/">Day One</a>.</p>
<p>Grant also would up 2005 with episodes of <a href="http://www.indieish.com/revolution/2005/12/12/the-revolution-22-unofficial-2005-ccmixter-countdown/">The Revolution</a> (unofficial ccMixter 2005 countdown) and <a href="http://www.staccatomusic.org/24/">Staccato</a> as a guest DJ.</p>
<p>2005 also brought a third program/podcast of all CC music, eight episodes of <a href="http://mondoglobo.net/thecommons/">Songs from the Commons</a>, with Lisa Rein as dj.  The most recent <a href="http://www.mondoglobo.net/thecommons/?p=13">show</a> is the strongest yet.</p>
<p>While numerous podcasts feature CC licensed music, as far as I know <em>Staccato</em>, <em>The Revolution</em>, and <em>Songs from the Commons</em> are the only program-length podcasts to feature <em>only</em> CC licensed music.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/">Black Sweater, White Cat</a></em> is also worth mentioning, as it features almost all CC licensed music, and is a full two hour weekly program broadcast at <a href="http://www.berkshireradio.org/">WBCR</a>, a community radio station in western Massachusetts, also available as a podcast. The program is really excellent--I've listened to many hours of BSWC archives, and plan to listen to every show in 2006.</p>
<p>Know of other CC-only music programs?  Leave a comment.</p>
<p>Rumor has it an all-funk guest hosted episode of Staccato is coming soon.  Listen in...</p>
