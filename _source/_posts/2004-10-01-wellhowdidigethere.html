<p>Back in Indiana after a whirl-wind week in New York City, I'm still processing the whole experience, telling everyone I can about Creative Commons and the concert.  Never having been to NYC, the entire experience is worth remembering.  That said, the concert definitely stands out in my mind.  Seeing the sheer energy of the volunteers manning our t-shirt table was inspiring.  Seeing the audience dancing in the aisle was heartening.  I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to "This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)" without picturing David Byrne jumping up and down on stage, and the entire audience jumping in time with him.</p>
<p>As I sipped my wine at the after party, reflecting on how lucky I am to have this job, David Byrne walked by.  Gil wasn't far behind.  And I thought to myself "Now <strong>this</strong> is a <em>Once in a Lifetime</em> moment," followed by</p>
<blockquote><p>"Well, how did I get here?<br /> <br />
This is not my beautiful life!  <br />
This is not my beautiful job!  <br />
These are not our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4342">beautiful offices</a>!"<br /> 
</p></blockquote>
<p>And most important, "Where does that highway go?"  And by "highway" I mean CC.</p>
