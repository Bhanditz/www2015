<p><img style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" title="nop" src="img/nop.jpg" alt="nop" width="400" height="133" />Creating a feature films is a massive undertaking, and it is for this reason that we're always so impressed to hear of film makers using CC licenses. Two recent examples are <em><a href="http://nastyoldpeople.org/">Nasty Old People</a></em> from Swedish director Hanna SkÃ¶ld and <em><a href="http://ilmiofilm.wordpress.com/">Torno Subito</a></em> from Italian Simone Damianiunder.</p>
<p>"Nasty Old People" was released under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license</a> and Torno Subito is available under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial license</a>. What's great about these licenses is that they both allow and encourage legal sharing and remixing as methods for promotion and encouraging fan engagement. The results are already beginning to appear: fans of Nasty Old People have raised donations amounting to <a href="http://nastyoldpeople.blogspot.com/2009/10/creative-pirate.html">10% of the film's loaned budget</a>, and they've also created a <a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3574584/nasty-old-people-pb">Portugese</a> translation of the film's subtitles.</p>
<p>Over the years, there <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14598">have</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13275">been</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7764">a</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4063">number</a> of CC-licensed feature films released, and we do our best to keep up with them all on our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Film">film wiki page</a>, but please add to the wiki if you come across something we've missed.</p>
