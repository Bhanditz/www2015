<p><a href="http://wikitravel.org">Wikitravel</a> and <a href="http://world66.com">World66</a>, two user generated content travel sites each using the same Creative Commons license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 1.0</a>) have been <a href="http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=27587&script=410&layout=-6&item_id=845378">acquired </a> by <a href="http://www.internetbrands.com">Internet Brands</a>, the operator of carsdirect.com and many other .com properties.</p>
<p>It's great to see Internet Brands' confidence in a business built on CC-licensed content, particularly under a BY-SA license, which permits forking, even for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Congratulations to World66, Wikitravel, and especially to Wikitravel cofounder <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/User:Evan">Evan Prodromou</a>, who has been an active supporter and constructive critic of Creative Commons from the beginning.</p>
