<p>This week is the fourth annual <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week</a>, and starting yesterday Oct 18, the official kick-off date, the CC community has been participating in various open access events around the globe. "<a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/brief.htm">Open-access</a> (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions." Taking place the same week everywhere, Open Access Week brings together people from all ends of the academic and research communities at various worldwide conferences, workshops, and other events to "continue to learn about the potential benefits of Open Access, to share what theyâ€™ve learned with colleagues, and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make Open Access a new norm in scholarship and research." Below is a (not exhaustive) list of what CC jurisdiction leads, open culture and open education advocates, and the Creative Commons staff are doing to inspire open access.</p>
<p><strong>CC Colombia</strong><br />
CC Colombia is kicking things off at a CC Salon in Cali today with the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Occidente (UAO). Tomorrow (Oct 20), they are holding a training activity on copyright and CC licenses for teachers at the Universidad de la Sabana (Chia), and they'll end the week with a conference with the research group of students at the National University (BogotÃ¡) on Oct 21. More info can be found at CC Colombia's <a href="http://co.creativecommons.org/2010/10/13/celebramos-la-semana-del-acceso-abierto/">blog</a>, the heart of which was kindly translated by CC Colombia Project Lead Carolina Botero. </p>
<p><strong>CC Aotearoa New Zealand</strong><br />
CC New Zealand will be focusing on open education this week, holding a webinar on Friday entitled, "Remixing Aotearoa," as part of the Open Education Resource Foundation's OA Week's webinar series. If you're in a manageable timezone, you can sign up to attend the webinars via <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Open_Access_Week_2010">WikiEducator</a>. CC NZ will also be featuring a series of interviews and profiles of individuals using CC. For more info, visit their <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/news_and_events/events/open_access_week_2010">site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CC Spain</strong><br />
CC Spain Project Lead Ignasi Labastida i Juan, also the head of the Office for Knowledge Dissemination at the Universitat de Barcelona, has organized several talks on open journals and open repositories following last year's events. More info about the program in Catalan can be found at the <a href="http://www.bib.ub.edu/serveis/odc/acces-obert/setmana-dacces-obert-2010/">University</a> site and in English at the <a href="http://openaccessweek.ning.com/events/event/listUserEvents?user=11limyap2pam6">OA Week</a> site. Ignasi himself spoke on Monday about OA policies and developments, and today will be speaking about research repositories.</p>
<p><strong>CC board and staff</strong><br />
Founding board member and professor at American University, Michael Carroll, will be <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/events/open-access-week-at-university?rsvpConfirm=1">speaking</a> at the University of Maryland later this week (Oct 21) to "discuss the growing open access movement, why access to information is so important, and what you can do to promote open access to your research." Science Commons Vice President, John Wilbanks, started the week yesterday at the University of Utah, and will be speaking at UC Davis again on Friday, in addition to a webinar for open access participants in Portugal on Thursday. CC Fellow Greg Grossmeier is speaking at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale on Wednesday, and will also give a talk on open educational resources (OER) at <a href="http://www.berlin8.org">berlin8</a> in Beijing, China next week (Oct 26). Myself, Jane Park, am participating in a panel today at NYU on open access for education, following the recent launch of NYU's <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/academics/open-education.html">Open Education Pilot</a>. Also stay tuned for Open Society Foundation (OSF) Policy Fellow Timothy Vollmer's interview with <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org">SPARC's Right to Research Coalition</a> this week; the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) is also a major organizer of OA Week activities. </p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons and Open Access -- <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_and_Open_Access">Doing our homework: Science @ Creative Commons, Open Access, and Lessons for OER</a></strong><br />
To further celebrate open access week in your part of the world, check out our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_and_Open_Access">brief analysis</a> of Creative Commons' contribution to the Open Access movement. We cover university access policies, the NIH Public Access Policy, the protocol for implementing open access data, and more, drawing comparisons and lessons from the development of the movement to how the open educational resources (OER) movement is progressing today. This is how we're thinking about open access and open education, and we'd love your feedback.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ictqatar.qa/output/Page1988.asp">Digitally Open: Innovation and Open Access Forum in Qatar</a></strong><br />
Lastly, we'd like to point you to a major event that's going to happen this Saturday in Qatar. This day-long forum celebrating open access features CC CEO Joi Ito, Science Commons VP John Wilbanks, CC Collecting Societies Liaison Paul Keller, CC Creative Director Eric Steuer, and CC Arab World Media and Development Manager Donatella Della Ratta (who is involved in organizing the event).
