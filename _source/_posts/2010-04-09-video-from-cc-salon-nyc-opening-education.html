<p>For those of you who missed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20499">CC Salon NYC: Opening Education</a>, we uploaded live recordings of the event to the <a href="http://creativecommons.blip.tv/">CC blip.tv channel</a> a while back. The video recording is split up into three parts in-line with the three sessions to make it easier for you to pick and choose what to watch: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://creativecommons.blip.tv/file/3420050/">Flat World Knowledge</a> (as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21634">mentioned</a> earlier today), </li>
<li><a href="http://creativecommons.blip.tv/file/3422954/">Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU)</a>, </li>
<li>and <a href="http://creativecommons.blip.tv/file/3423768/">a dynamic panel of K-12 technologists and educators</a> (my personal favorite from the event). </li>
</ul>
<p>All videos are available via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, of course. I'd also like to point out that the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2053">Hewlett OER Grantees meeting</a> is going on right now, which you can follow with the hashtag #oerhf.</p>
