<p>Last week a U.S. district court judge <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/6217">issued a preliminary injunction</a> against the publication of <em>60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye</em>, a book based on the idea of J.D. Salinger's Holden Caufield character as a 76 year old man. Strong reactions to the ruling have come from many across the legal, literary and technology fields, for example <a href="http://madisonian.net/2009/07/02/salinger-takes-another-round/">Mike Madison</a>, <a href="http://rsa.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/3011">Jim Brown</a>, and <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20090702/0125045432.shtml">Mike Masnick</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://mymediamusings.com/2009/07/02/judge-indefinitely-bans-coming-through-the-rye/">My Media Musings</a> delivers the bottom line, easily understood by all:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing judges ban books is never a good thing.  Seeing a judge ban a book for such flimsy reasons as this is downright frightening.  If her ruling stands, expect to see a long line of similar suits in the near future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course one way to take an affirmative stance for reasonable copyright (still strongly trending toward increasing unreasonableness, as evinced by the above) is to grant permission in advance for some uses of your work with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">CC license</a> or all uses with the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 waiver</a>. Another is to <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">support our work financially</a> and <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/spread">spread the word</a>.</p>
