<p>Today, nonprofits and donors around the world are celebrating <a href="http://community.givingtuesday.org/">#GivingTuesday</a>. When you're deciding what organizations to support this year, <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog2&utm_medium=blog">we hope you consider Creative Commons</a>.</p>
<p>We have a lot to celebrate together this year. Last week, we unveiled <a href="/weblog/entry/40768">Version 4.0 of the Creative Commons license suite</a>, an accomplishment that reflects two years of work by literally hundreds of people.</p>
<p>More than any CC license before, Version 4.0 reflects the power of the CC movement. It was built upon the expertise of our amazing global community, a community that you join when you license or use content under CC licenses. We&#8217;re glad to be on your team.</p>
<p>If you're proud of what we've accomplished together, <a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog2&utm_medium=blog">consider making a donation to support CC's work in 2014</a>.</p>
