<p><a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">Indaba Music</a>, "an international community of musicians, music professionals, and fans exploring the creative possibilities of making music with people in different places", has recently <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/blogs/show/news/836-session-file-licensing">added the ability to CC-license tracks to its user interface</a>.</p>
<p>This is great news, especially for a community that is firmly based around of the concept of new and interesting forms of collaboration. Incorporating CC-licenses on work posted to Indaba helps bring clarity to the community in terms of what can be shared and reused and what can't. Now, artists and musicians can clearly dictate which works they wish others to build upon, and similarly, see which works allow themselves to be reused. Up until this point, Indaba's community has certainly embodied the ethos behind CC-licenses - that of a flexible and user-defined approach to content creation. Now, it is able to do so more explicitly.</p>
