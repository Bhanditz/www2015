<p><a href="http://rejon.org/2008/05/02/ocwc-conference-in-dalian-2008-and-beijing/">I just wrote a big post up</a> on my appearance at the big Open Educational Resources conference OpenCourseWare Conference 2008 in Dalian. It is cut apart below:</p>

<p>I just arrived back home in <a href="/tag/guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="/tag/china">China</a> from the <a href="http://www.core.org.cn/en/conferences/dalian_2008">OpenCourseWare Conference in Dalian, China</a> <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=77">last weekend</a> and met <a href="http://bokaap.net/open-edu/open-courseware-consortium-meeting-dalian/">many</a> <a href="http://reganmian.net/blog/2008/05/01/open-learning-conference-in-dalian-2008-lessons-for-future-events/">great people</a> (but don&#8217;t have the tolerance to write out the contents of my thoughts ;), had many fruitful discussions, and rocked out a good slide deck for <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/weblog/2008/04/15/7963">ccLearn</a> (and you!). Check out my presentation (or <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rejon">any of my presentations</a> and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/people/view/3525-jon-phillips">here</a>), &#8220;<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2651146/OER-XinXai-NOW-Dalian-OCWC-Conference-2008">OER XinXai (NOW!)</a>.</p>
<p>The most fruitful part of the conference for me was interacting with <a href="http://bokaap.net/open-edu/open-courseware-consortium-meeting-dalian/">Philip Schmidt</a>, Victor from Hewlett Foundation, Chunyan Wang from <a href="http://cn.creativecommons.org">CC Mainland China</a>, and Stewart Cheifet from <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. Also, hearing about sustain-o-bility in all its forms as a major consideration for projects, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/ccplus">mentions of CC+</a>, made me quite happy. It also served as a nice place to test out my Mandarin skills for the good or worse of things. Hopefully at the next conference there will be more time for discussion during the conference days.</p>
<p>I jumped up on stage to give a final call for participation to the <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org">ccLearn and OER regional meeting at iSummit July 29 - August 1</a> in order to increase participation by principals in the region. Let&#8217;s hope it worked!</p>
<p>After this conference, I directly headed to Beijing where I worked with CC Mainland China team on accelerating business development and assessing great projects which would be great to integrate <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses">Creative Commons licensing</a>. If you have an organization in China or any jurisdiction and want to help in this process, check out the page <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/web_integration">CC Web Integration</a>.</p>
<p>The next stop for me is to head to celebrate <a href="http://deerfang.org">Lu&#8217;s</a> 27th birthday on May 4th, then onto Japan to meet up <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international">Catharina</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fumi/">Fumi</a> and more (ken!). Then back to <a href="/tag/guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="/tag/beijing">Beijing</a>, then back to Guangzhou, then back in <a href="/tag/sf">San Francisco</a> May 21 through at least end of July as homebase. Cheers!</p>
