<p>Public broadcasters often ask themselves: how to better enable tax payers to access the works that they have paid for? This was the question that the BBC, the public broadcaster for the United Kingdom, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/bbc_constitution/bbc_royal_charter_and_agreement/Building_Public_Value.pdf" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">addressed</a> in 2004 during the debate over its charter renewal. The result of their deliberations was a yearlong pilot, the  <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Creative Archive Licensing Group project</a>, launched in September 2005.</p>
<p>The objective of the Creative Archive was to make BBC material available online to UK citizens. The content was released under a <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/licence/nc_sa_by_ne/uk/prov/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Creative Archive Licence</a>, a license similar in some respects to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commerical ShareAlike License</a>, but more restrictive in that it allowed only non-profit educational &amp; personal use, forbade promotional or campaign use, and limited these rights to within the UK.</p>
<p>During the pilot period, the Creative Archive received much praise. At its conclusion in September 2006, the BBC had <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/archives/for_download/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">released</a> nearly 500 clips, full programs, audio tracks, and images. As the recent director of the Creative Archive Paul Gerhardt noted in <a href="http://goodcopybadcopy.blip.tv/file/151953/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">an interview</a>, viewers respected the licenses, and during the trial period, only two minor licensing breaches had been reported. However, <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/archives/2006/06/paul_gerhardts.html" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank"> a hurdle</a> for the initiative was the fact that the Creative Archive could only license simple rights material from the BBC, which meant that no third-party programming could be included in the Archive.</p>
<p>Still, as Herkko Hietanen points out in  <em><a href="http://turre.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=41" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Community Created Content</a></em>, "The [Creative Archive] was in line with BBC's goal '<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/foi/docs/bbc_constitution/bbc_royal_charter_and_agreement/Building_Public_Value.pdf" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank"> to turn the BBC into an open cultural and creative resource for the nation'</a>." The Creative Archive was indeed a significant step for public interest and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2004/sep/20/mondaymediasection.bbc" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank"> one of the BBC's most applauded initiatives</a>. And so, although the Creative Archive is not longer in active use, the philosophy of open licensing has continued to grow within the BBC.</p>
<p>Today several departments in the BBC publish content under Creative Commons licenses: album reviews (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/c2w6/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">for example</a>) and <a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2007/06/the_bbc_partner.html" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">a partnership</a> with <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a>, a community music metadatabase that uses CC licenses. Furthermore, under other licensing conditions, the BBC has opened up its website to developers at <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">backstage.bbc.co.uk</a>. It also offers television and radio programs to stream or download through its <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">iPlayer</a>, although the player's format has been the source of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer#Criticisms" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">some criticism</a>.</p>
<p>The BBC's dedication to public access has helped inspire several other open projects for European public broadcasters. In November 2007 the <a href="http://www.ndr.de/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Norddeutscher Rundfunk</a> (NDR), a public radio and television broadcaster in Germany's national broadcasting consortium ARD, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7838" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">announced</a>  that they will use CC licenses for some of their programs. The six-month pilot has so far generated <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7842" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">positive coverage</a>, and it is hoped that its services will be continued.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://www.dr.dk/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Danish Broadcasting Corporation</a> features CC-licensed images and content on its website, and it was the first broadcaster to purchase and air the CC-licensed documentary, <a href="http://www.goodcopybadcopy.net/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Good Copy Bad Copy</a>. In the Netherlands, the public broadcasting network <a href="http://www.vpro.nl/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">VPRO</a> has implemented CC licenses for its <a href="http://3voor12.vpro.nl/plundertmusea/kaft/index.jsp" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank"> 3voor12 Plundert Musea</a> project, which makes available samples from rare musical instruments, and furthermore the Dutch broadcaster also promotes CC music on its radio show <a href="http://www.vpro.nl/programma/wissel/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Wissel</a>. Also of note is <a href="http://www.beeldenvoordetoekomst.nl/en" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">Images for the Future</a>, a joint project funded by the Dutch government to digitize nearly 3 million photos, 140,000 hours of audio, and 150,000 hours of video &amp; film, which is another great example of efforts to preserve the commons through online public access to cultural resources.</p>
<p>However, despite many positive strides, creators working for public broadcasters still often find themselves at odds with their institutions' more traditional copyright policies. In-house legal departments can be reluctant to embrace user-generated content, remixes, downloads, and third-party material, and at times, they may endorse restrictive DRM while resisting new and open media formats. As more and more publicly-funded content goes online, it is important enable and empower users, rather than leaving enriching material to digitally decay.</p>
