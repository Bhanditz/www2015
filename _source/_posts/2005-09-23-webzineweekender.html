<p>If you're near San Francisco this weekend, come over to <a href="http://webzine2005.com/">Webzine 2005</a>'s independent online publishing workshops, exhibitions, forums, and parties. Nearly all of the events have some relevance to free culture. One highlight is Saturday's <a href="http://webzine2005.com/schedule/">featured speaker</a>, Jacob Appelbaum, who has CC licensed thousands of photos, including a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ioerror/tags/katrina/">huge collection of post-Katrina photos</a>, via Flickr.</p>
<p>I and <a href="http://rejon.org">Jon Phillips</a> (recent addition to the CC crew; more later) will be present, and will also present on a topic to be announced in the <a href="http://webzine2005.com/schedule/">Master's Lounge</a>. Also catch Webzine <a href="http://webzine2005.com/aboutus/">co-organizer</a> and <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/">Get Creative/Reticulum Rex</a> animator Ryan Junell, if you can.</p>
