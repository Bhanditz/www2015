<p>Next in a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051">series</a> addressing a <a href="http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2007-December/035677.html">suggested Wikipedia CC BY-SA migration checklist</a>, today I'm publishing a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Draft_Attribution-ShareAlike_Intent"><b>DRAFT</b> Creative Commons Statement of Intent for Attribution-ShareAlike Licenses</a>.</p>
<p>This draft statement attempts describe 1) what CC does as a license developer and steward, 2) why CC Attribution-ShareAlike licenses play a special role in the movement for free cultural works -- clearly inspired by the free software movement, and 3) CC's intentions as steward of Attribution-ShareAlike licenses, in the context of (1) and (2).</p>
<p>Note that while (1) provides a reasonable explanation of the role CC plays for all of the licenses it develops, (2) and (3) apply only to Attribution-ShareAlike licenses. Anyone who wants a thorough understanding of the contours of content in this age should take the time to understand the movement this statement addresses. However, other communities have different requirements. It is conceivable that at some point CC will need to address the requirements of other communities in relation to other particular CC licenses and tools that help those communities. One example of this -- which takes a different form because all existing CC licenses are too restrictive for the community in question (but public domain and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8045">in-development CC0 waiver</a> are just right) -- is the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/">Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open Access Data</a>. Still other communities rely on more restrictive CC licenses.</p>
<p>This particular draft statement has been previewed to many people within CC, CC's international project teams, Wikipedians, and free software advocates. However, I take responsibility for its unwieldy verbosity and any minor or fundamental flaws it may have, and for taking too long to take this step of posting for public review. Comments and criticism are strongly encouraged.
