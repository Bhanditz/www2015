<p>We've just gotten word that Microsoft has upped its pledge by $15,000 to put us <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11910">over the top for the year</a>. Microsoft has been a corporate sponsor of Creative Commons for the past 4 years and we're delighted to have their continued support. </p>
