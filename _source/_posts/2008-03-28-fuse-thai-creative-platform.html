<p><a href="http://fuse.in.th/">FUSE!</a> is a Thai creative platform that aims to connect filmmakers, musicians, photographers, and other creative individuals in one space while encouraging reuses of each other's work. All content is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>, making the sharing and reuse of these works not only encouraged but legally sound.</p>
<p>The best works are published in a quarterly publication (with DVD accompaniment) which is distributed to various bookstores and universities in Thailand, motivating content creators to showcase their works through FUSE as well as attracting others to go to the website and participate. In addition to this, FUSE holds monthly "Bar Camp style" meetups where creators showcase their various projects to one another, fostering off-line collaboration in tandem with the FUSE's online presence.</p>
