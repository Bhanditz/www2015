<p>Many of you have heard about California's Free Digital Textbook Initiative that <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/12225/">launched</a> last spring, which called for submissions of free digital textbooks in math and science for use by the state's schools. Of the 16 textbooks submitted last year, 15 are openly licensed under one of the Creative Commons licenses---and all 10 that passed 90% of CA's state standards are CC licensed. </p>
<p>In addition to individuals, the <a href="http://ck12.org">CK-12 Foundation</a>, <a href="http://curriki.org">Curriki</a>, and <a href="http://cnx.org">Connexions</a> submitted open textbooks on subjects like Algebra, Calculus, Biology, Chemistry, Geometry, Trigonometry, and various other -ometries. You can check out the full textbook list and standards reviews at the <a href="http://www.clrn.org/fdti/">California Learning Resource Network</a> (CLRN). </p>
<p>Now, the Governor and his constituents are <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/14279">launching Phase 2</a> of the Initiative, calling this time for "content developers to submit high school history-social science and higher-level math course textbooks for review against Californiaâ€™s academic content standards." From the <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/14279">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œResources like digital textbooks play a critical role in our 21st century educational landscape, and expanding my first-in-the-nation initiative will provide local school districts additional high-quality free resources to help prepare Californiaâ€™s students to compete in the global marketplace,â€ said Governor Schwarzenegger. â€œI urge content developers to jump on board this second phase and submit social science and advanced math material to help ensure Californiaâ€™s shift to a more advanced and cost-effective education system continues.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>Phase 2 is accepting submissions on a rolling basis, so if you (or your project) have an open textbook completed or in the works, make sure the CC license info is <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking">marked up</a> correctly and submit it to the <a href="http://www.clrn.org/dti2/">CLRN website</a>.
