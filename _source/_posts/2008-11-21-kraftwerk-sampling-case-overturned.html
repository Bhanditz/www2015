<p>German electronic-music pioneers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a> were told yesterday by a judge in Germany that a two-second sample used by a producer in Germany did not infringe on their copyright. From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7740515.stm">BBC</a> (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>The ruling overturns an earlier decision against Moses Pelham's use of a short sample from Metal on Metal.</p>
<p>Judges in Berlin said the two second extract did not infringe copyright, as his song was <strong>substantially different</strong>. </p></blockquote>
