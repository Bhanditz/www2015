<h2>More about Projects in Motion Ltd.</h2>
<p>Projects in Motion Ltd (PiM) was set up to provide the leadership and expertise required to boost Maltaâ€™s participation in a range of European programmes and initiatives.  It addresses the need expressed by local SMEs for more specific information and assistance structures, promoting international cooperation and networking; and offering services related to ICTs, management, research, training and dissemination activities.</p>
<p>PiMâ€™s core personnel have over the past ten years accumulated extensive experience in several European programmes, having been involved in a high number of projects through their former organisations.  PiMâ€™s network of experts covers areas like ICT, education, health, law, as well as cultural, scientific, environmental, agricultural and socio-economic disciplines.  Through its association with other multipliers, PiM will strive to overcome the existing high fragmentation of resources.  It will support the clustering of local players to create knowledge-intensive, multi-stakeholder partnerships possessing the critical mass needed to achieve excellence.  PiM therefore aims to facilitate the transformation of local SMEs into learning organisations set to reap the benefits of the knowledge economy.</p>
