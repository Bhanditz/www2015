<p>In case you missed it among our other many cool re-design features this fall, I'd strongly recommended subscribing to the RSS feeds for <a href="http://commoncontent.org">Common Content</a> (RSS <a href="http://commoncontent.org/rss/newest.cgi">here</a>) and the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> (RSS <a href="http://www.archive.org/services/collection-rss.php?licensed_only=1">here</a>).</p>
<p>Put them in your favorite blog-/news-reader, and you've got a fresh batch of free culture waiting for you every morning.</p>
