<p>We're collaborating with <a href="http://www.museumpods.com/">MuseumPods</a>, a company focused on helping museums and other institutions publish podcasts, on a project to learn more about the how members of the museum and education communities want to share the media they create. If you are affiliated with a museum - and particularly if your museum produces podcasts or is interested in doing so - we encourage you to spend a few minutes taking our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/podcastsurvey">Podcast Publishing, Access, and Rights Survey</a>. Your responses will be used to help us make decisions about ways we can make it easier for musuems to mark their media with clear permissions. The data will also be aggregated later and shared online, but your answers will remain anonymous.</p>
