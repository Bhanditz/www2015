<p>
500,000 pictures taken between 1880 and 1990 are now in a searchable <a href="http://beeldbank.nationaalarchief.nl/">Dutch National Archive Image Bank</a>. If you speak enough Dutch to navigate the site, there's quite a lot of history here. It looks like current <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:fxB74aEj6-MJ:www.ivir.nl/legislation/nl/copyrightact.html+dutch+copyright+laws+images&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">Dutch copyright laws</a> are similar to the US, lasting until a creator's death + 70 years, so it's tough to tell how much of the archive is free for reuse. Still, it's cool to see another country take their archives online for everyone to see. [thanks <a href="http://prolific.org/">prolific</a>]</p>
