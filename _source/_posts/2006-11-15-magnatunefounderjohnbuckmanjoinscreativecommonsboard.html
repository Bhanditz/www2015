<p>Creative Commons is pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune Records</a> founder <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/">John Buckman</a> has joined our board of directors.</p>
<p>Magnatune Records is an Internet-based record label that uses Creative Commons licensing to gain wider audiences for its music. Magnatune currently represents over 220 recording artists and released its 500th album in October 2006.</p>
<p>Buckman had this to say: "I'm thrilled that Creative Commons has asked me to contribute at this level. Through Magnatune I've been trying to show how the commons can help businesses succeed in a commercial sense. I have a lot to say about how CC principles can be applied successfully to the for-profit world."</p>
<p>Creative Commons' CEO, Lawrence Lessig, said this: "The next challenge for CC is to figure out how the sharing economy can complement a traditional commercial economy. John's expertise in this area will be hugely beneficial."</p>
