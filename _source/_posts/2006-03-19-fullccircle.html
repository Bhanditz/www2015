<p>Former CC Executive Director <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/alumni#16">Neeru Paharia</a> (now working on a PhD at Harvard Business School) writes in:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm entering this business plan contest that is focused on poverty alleviation: <a href="http://www.bidnetwork.org/">http://www.bidnetwork.org</a>. They are dragging me through a CC license choice for my business plan! I admit, I never would have thought of it unless they made me go through this. I guess things have come full circle now...</p></blockquote>
