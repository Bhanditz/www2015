<p>CC founder Lawrence Lessig <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12008">appeared on the Colbert Report</a> last Thursday talking about his latest book, REMIX. The segment was great, and hilarious, as is typical for Colbert -- and double plus fun for copyright geeks and activists, as Colbert challenged the audience to not remix the interview "with some great dance beat, and then it starts showing up in clubs across America."</p>
<p>Lessig pointed out on air that because he didn't waive his joint copyrights to the segment, he and Colbert are <a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter0/0-c.html#2">joint owners, and</a> either can exploit the work freely. In this case Lessig has published the interview under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, allowing anyone to remix or even commercially exploit the work for free.</p>
