<p><a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/184">Great news</a> coming in from our friends at <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">CC Australia</a> - the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/">ABC</a>, Australia's national public broadcaster, just launched a CC-friendly social media space, <a href="http://www.pool.org.au/"><strong>Pool</strong></a>, which is designed to provide a "place for creative content makers to upload their work, publish and collaborate." Pool offers users the ability to upload their content - whatever the medium - under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/license/">full suite of CC licences</a> (as well as All Rights Reserved) for other users to reuse and share. From the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/184">CCau</a><span style="LOL"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Pool's Executive Producer, Sherre Delys, puts it in this <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/mediareport/stories/2008/2342255.htm">interview</a> with Radio National's <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/mediareport/">The Media Report</a>, the CC licensing means that "POOL starts to be a place where you can connect with others, and so for some that will take the form of online mentoring and skill-sharing; for others it's a collaborative work space, they can download each other's work, re-mix and re-use, and it also includes collaboration between ABC producers and audiences, and I think that's really critical." And in a first for the national broadcaster, Sherre also talks about Pool's intention to release ABC archival footage for remix by it's audience, sometime in the near future.</p></blockquote>
