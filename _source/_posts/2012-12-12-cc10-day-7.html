<p>On day 7 of our CC10 celebrations we have an exciting <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35710">announcement</a>: the <a href="http://www.sbctc.ctc.edu">Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges</a> (SBCTC) has <a href="http://www.sbctc.ctc.edu/general/documents/2012_12_06_I-DEA_grant_final.pdf">announced</a> a 3.5 million dollar grant from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a> for a new program to help adult English language learners improve their language skills â€” Integrated Digital English Acceleration (I-DEA). Importantly, all online learning modules developed for I-DEA will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution license â€”  the most liberal of our licences, allowing all teachers around the country and the world to reuse, remix and reinterpret them. </p>
<p>In honor of this announcement, we focus on education for today's <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org">CC10</a> featured platform and resource. We take a look at <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Open_content_licensing_for_educators/Home">Open content licensing for educators</a>, one of the many courses provided by <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page">Wikieducator</a>, a community-developed resource of free elearning content - created by the public, for the public. The Open content licensing for educators course, an initiative of the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home">OER Foundation</a>, has been running all this week, training educators both how to make full use of the wealth of educational resources now available for free download under CC and other open licenses, and how to share their own materials with others.</p>
<p>We also celebrate a milestone by another great community-created platform, as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35812">Wikicommons hits 15 million files</a>, just in time for CC10. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikicommons </a>is one of the world's oldest and largest resources of CC licensing and public domain media, from photos to videos to sound files. It's the source of all the media you find on <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, and its files are used extensively by cultural and educational institutions to share and create open education resources. Check out our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35812">post</a> on this great achievement to see two videos by our friends at <a href="http://www.wikiafrica.org/">WikiAfrica</a>, explaining how and why a cultural institution might want to share their resources on Wikicommons.</p>
<p>Finally - everyone should take a moment to appreciate the fabulous CC10 poster above by <a href="https://twitter.com/saidRmdhani/status/278531014870052864/">@saidRmdhani</a>. It was produced by attendees to our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34417">Arab World Regional Meeting</a>, which has been running all this week in Cairo, and finishes up today. Congratulations to all the attendees, and we can't wait to hear more about your workshops.</p>
