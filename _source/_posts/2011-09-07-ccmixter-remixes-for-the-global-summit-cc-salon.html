<p>Two of the main Polish acts for the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011/Cultural_Events#Creative_Commons_Salon_.28Concert.29">Global Summit CC Salon</a> (a musical concert) are encouraging remixes of their tracks under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>. A couple sample tracks have been uploaded to ccMixter.org, under users "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/masala/profile">masala</a>" and "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/axmusique/profile">axmusique</a>."</p>
<p><a href="http://masalasound.pl/">Masala</a> is a music fusion collective whose genre can only be determined as ethno-electro-ragga-punk-hip-hop, which is famous for combining Asian music with electronics. Masala wants you to remix <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/masala/uploads">Rewolucja w nas</a> at ccMixter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/axmusique">AXMusique</a> is an unusual producer duo who earned the affection of fans and publishers with powerful concerts mixing electronic and rock-and-roll music. AXMusique wants you to remix <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/axmusique/uploads">Hardline</a> at ccMixter.</p>
<p>Both musical groups will choose their favorite remixes, which will be played at the CC Salon with names of the remixers projected by VJs.
