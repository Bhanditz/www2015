<p><a href="http://www.tribeofnoise.com/">Tribe of Noise</a>, a community driven music discovery network, is now open for all to join and participate.Â  Tribe of Noise, which was started by  Hessel van Oorschot and Sandra Brandenburg in the Netherlands, allows artists to upload their works using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC:BY-SA</a> license.Â  The roots and goals of the project are related to the Open Source Software community which in turn influenced the license Tribe of Noise chose.</p>
<p>Tribe of Noise is using this license so the community can discover new music and develop new relationships with the participating artists.</p>
