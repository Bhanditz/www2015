<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18387">Last October</a>, Film Annex, "an online film distribution platform and and Web Television Network with million of viewers and thousands of filmmakers," launched CC license support, enabling film makers to make their films available under one of the CC licenses. Since then, Film Annex has been hosting <a href="http://www.waroffilms.com/">The War of Films</a>, "a monthly film contest that rewards filmmakers and viewers with cash prizes." "The film that gets the highest number of votes on Film Annexâ€™s platform at the end of the month will be the winner of the $1000 cash award. Film Annex will also reward the most active voter with $100 (US, Canada and UK) or $25 (other countries) at the end of each day."</p>
