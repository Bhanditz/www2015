<p>The <a href="http://ccmixter.org/vieux">Vieux Farka TourÃ© remix contest</a> has been a phenomenal success so far -- and there's still one more day to get your remixes of "Ana" uploaded to ccMixter before the contest ends. Don't miss out on this opportunity to have your music included on <a href="http://www.modiba.net/">Modiba Productions</a>â€™ upcoming â€œVieux Remixedâ€ CD compilation!</p>
<p>It's been really fun to hear the variety of <a href="http://ccmixter.org/vieux/view/contest/entries">entries</a>. Everything from dub to Afrobeat to a fusion of Malian and Eastern European music. Keep 'em coming!</p>
