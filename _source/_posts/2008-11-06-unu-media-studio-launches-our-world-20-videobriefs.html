<p>Some of you might remember Cameron's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7532">post</a> back in June regarding the <a href="http://mediastudio.unu.edu/en">United Nations University (UNU) Media Studio</a>'s decision to license their Media Studio and Online Learning sites under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>. Well one month later they launched "<a href="http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/">Our World 2.0</a>", the English version, also licensed under the same (with the <a href="http://ourworld.unu.edu/jp/">Japanese version</a> taking off just this past month), which is a webzine dedicated to exploring environmental issues and what can be done about them, specifically dealing with the "complex, inter-connected and pressing problems like climate change, oil depletion and food security." Taking its name from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a>, a sweeping trend in the use of the Internet for "community and social network based approaches to content development that take advantage of new technologies," Our World 2.0's <a href="http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/about/">central tenet</a> is "that we can use our collective knowledge, technology and design to facilitate creativity, innovation, and, most notably, collaboration amongst people."</p>
<p>Today, they <a href="http://mediastudio.unu.edu/en/2008/11/06/launch-of-our-world-20-videobriefs-series/">announced</a> the launch of their new video documentary series on the web, "short high-definition documentaries which examine key issues relating to climate change, energy, and food security, the subjects at the heart of [their] Our World 2.0 webmagazine." The first video is titled "<a href="http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/2008/10/29/electric-cars-hitting-roads-around-the-globe/">The Electric Sunflower</a>" which focuses on electric vehicles---their current use and future. It's pretty exciting stuff. The video, along with the rest of the content on their website, is open for use via <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mediastudio.unu.edu/en/">UNU Media Studio</a> is dedicated to the sharing and creation of Open Educational Resources (OER), which they believe will ultimately improve education. They <a href="http://mediastudio.unu.edu/en/about/">write</a> that "[Their] main goal is to try to help academics in the developing world and [they] are fully engaged with a number of exciting innovative movements that could help better share knowledge and improve education. These include efforts to share content (opencourseware and open educational resources). This movement is supported by new approaches to copyright licensing and intellectual property rights that promote sharing and collaboration, specifically through Creative Commons."</p>
