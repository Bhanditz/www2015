<p><strong><em>The Power of Open</em>: Stories of creators sharing knowledge, art, &amp; data using Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p>Released a couple weeks ago, <em>The Power of Open</em> demonstrates the impact of Creative Commons through stories of successful use of our tools by artists, educators, scientists, and institutions of all types. <em>The Power of Open</em> is available for free download at <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1107&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">http://thepowerofopen.org</a> under CC BY. It is available in several languages, with more translated versions to come, and you can also order hard copies from Lulu. We hope that it inspires you to examine and embrace the practice of open licensing so that your contributions to the global intellectual commons can provide their greatest benefit to all people. <em>The Power of Open </em>was made possible by our <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/supporters/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1107&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">supporters</a>, to whom we are deeply grateful, and the numerous creators featured, initially as part of our Case Studies project.

<p><strong>Over 400 million CC-licensed works, with increasing freedom</strong></p>
<p style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;"><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28041?utm_campaign=newsletter_1107&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter"><span><img src="img/powerofopen-adoption-chart-small.png" alt="powerofopen-adoption-chart-small" /></span></a></p>
<p>The book also features two pages sketching the socio-economic value and numerical adoption of CC tools. <em>â€œHow has adoption of Creative Commons grown?â€</em> is a difficult question given the decentralized nature of the web, but not as difficult as measuring economic value. Since Creative Commonsâ€™ first year, we have tracked the number of web links to Creative Commons licenses reported by search engine queries and the number of works licensed at major repositories. Derived from these a very conservative estimate of the approximate minimum number of licensed works at the end of each year is plotted at right â€“ from under 1 million works after the first year, to over 400 million at the end of 2010.
