Quotes about the Vieux Farka TourÃ© / â€œAnaâ€ Remix Contest:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jesse Brenner, Modiba Productions:</strong></p>
<p>"One of Modiba's central goals as an organization is collaboration, the expansion of boundaries to bring in new ideas and approaches through working together in an open and dynamic way. The Creative Commons project is a perfect example of this, and we look forward to  bringing more talented and inspired minds to further explore the  sounds of Vieux Farka TourÃ©."</p>
<p><strong>Derek Beres, Global Beat Fusion:</strong></p>
<p>"Taking Vieux's incredible acoustic material and adding a digital edge is what the future of global music is about. We've been remixing cultures as long as cultures have formed, explored and, inevitably, met one another. Our modern technological capabilities are giving us the opportunity to get to know one another socially, spiritually and sonically. This project will be yet another meeting ground, this time the gorgeous blues of Mali and the rest of the creative world."</p>
<p><strong>About Vieux Farka TourÃ©</strong></p>
<p>Vieux Farka TourÃ© is the son of the late international superstar and two-time Grammy Award-winner Ali Farka TourÃ©. An historic passing of the torch from father to son is represented by Vieuxâ€™s debut. He has crafted a global-minded style all his own with original compositions displaying flourishes of rock and reggae amidst Saharan Blues and traditional Malian melodies. Vieux Farka TourÃ© is ushering in the next generation of Mali blues on his self-titled debut album, which features Ali himself on two remarkable pieces. These tracks are the only existing recordings of father and son playing together, and are amongst the final recorded material of Ali before his death. The album also features two magnificent guest performances by the Grammy Award-winning kora master Toumani DiabatÃ©.</p>
