<p>The <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/">OpenCourseWare Consortium</a> (OCWC), a community of over <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/members/members/master">250 member institutions</a> worldwide committed to sharing their courses online, has voted to present Creative Commons CEO Cathy Casserly with the President's Award for OpenCourseWare Excellence, a special recognition of her extraordinary contributions to the open courseware community. Prior to Cathy's role as the CEO of Creative Commons and Senior Partner and Vice President of Innovation and Open Networks at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Cathy,</p>
<blockquote><p>"served as director of the Open Educational Resources Initiative at The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and guided more than $100 million in support to increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge sharing worldwide. Casserlyâ€™s work helped raise global awareness of resources, participants and their projects."</p></blockquote>

Cathy, along with other distinguished recipients, will be presented the award at the upcoming <a href="http://conferences.ocwconsortium.org/index.php/2011/cambridge">OCWC meeting</a> in May, celebrating 10 years of open courseware. </p>
