<p><a href="http://www.optaros.com">Optaros</a> has published a guide to "enterprise ready" open source software under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Attribution</a> license. <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/217079/rss">Linux Weekly News reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Opteros has announced the release of an "Open Source Catalog," designed to help companies decide which projects are "enterprise ready."  Actually downloading the report requires registration, but it's under a Creative<br />
Commons license, so we've made <a href="http://lwn.net/images/pdf/optaros-catalog-2007.pdf">a copy available [PDF]</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are many guides and catalogs for open source business software online and doubtless there are things to quibble with about Optaros' take, but having a fairly comprehensive catalog in a nice looking 45 page PDF may come in handy at IT departments worldwide. Handier still, the CC license allows customization so long as credit is given to Optaros.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Optaros' home page says:<br />
<blockquote><s>Build vs. Buy</s>Assemble? Optaros offers a third alternative to the "build versus buy" decision with our proven application assembly methodology (OptAM).</p></blockquote>
<p>Take the marketing lingo with a grain of salt, but it's interesting to translate the metaphor to media: Work for hire vs. negotiate licenses? [Re]using CC licensed content offers a third alternative.</p>
