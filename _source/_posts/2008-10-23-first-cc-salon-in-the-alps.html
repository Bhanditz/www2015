<p><a href="http://creativecommons.at/">From CC Austria</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We proudly announce the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.at/salon/">first CC Salon to be held in the Alps</a> in the net<br />
culture labs of the cities <a href="http://lab.netculture.at/kontakt/wien/">Vienna</a> and <a href="http://lab.netculture.at/kontakt/dornbirn/">Dornbirn</a> simultaneously, connected with<br />
a video bridge.</p>
<p>CC licensing has become very popular in Austria and even found its way in<br />
curricula of media design students. Together with the Austrian Chamber of<br />
Commerce, the creative sector association just published 10.000 booklets,<br />
explaining the pitfalls of the copyright in daily creative work, and<br />
suggesting CC as a preferred licensing model.</p>
<p>We would like to welcome guests from surrounded areas. Any other city in the<br />
alps is invited to follow up with a next salon event.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_alps_Salon">CC Alps Salon</a> will take place today, October 23, at 1930 CET.</p>
