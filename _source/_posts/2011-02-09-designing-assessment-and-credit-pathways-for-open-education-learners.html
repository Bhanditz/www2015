<p>Getting students formal credit for their free and open education is a challenge, but groups and institutions are working around the world to come up with alternative pathways to recognition. The Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is one such group that explored the topic in an assessment workshop last September and then co-designed virtual "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges">badges</a>" for recognition in real time at the Mozilla Drumbeat Festival in Barcelona. P2PU and Mozilla are <a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/w/page/35266593/January-Badges">piloting these badges</a> via the P2PU School of Webcraft, and have <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/content/badges-show-your-awesome-skills">solicited</a> would-be developers for the skills and competencies that would best be reflected by a badge system. In collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation, they have drafted <em><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGuyK4h7DLVeOrFPeegB4ORMutblJf9xVRZCizgx_j8/edit?hl=en&authkey=CNarn4UJ">An Open Badge System Framework: A foundational piece on assessment and badges</a></em> (Google doc).</p>

<p>Alternatives, such as the badge system above, may factor into a plan to bring formal recognition to open education learners' achievements. In an effort to combine institutional forces, the Open Educational Resources (OER) Foundation will host an international <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_for_Assessment_and_Credit_for_Students/Meetings">planning meeting</a> on February 23 to co-design assessment and credit pathways for open learning. As open educational resources (OER) under CC licenses become more integrated into institutional education, the OER foundation (along with Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand, the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, and Athabasca University in Canada) is hoping to "provide flexible pathways for OER learners to earn formal academic credit and pay reduced fees for assessment and credit."</p>
<blockquote><p>The challenge is to find robust mechanisms for academic credit for these OER learners. â€œStudents seek flexible study opportunities, but they also want their achievements recognised in credible credentials.â€ said Sir John Daniel, President of the Commonwealth of Learning. â€œThis important meeting will tackle the challenges of combining flexibility with rigour, which requires clarity in conception and quality in execution.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>The OER Foundation invites and encourages all post-secondary institutions and others "who care about sharing knowledge as a core value of education" to join the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_for_Assessment_and_Credit_for_Students/Meetings">meeting</a>, which will be streamed <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_for_Assessment_and_Credit_for_Students/Meetings#Virtual_participants">virtually</a> by UNESCO to enable participation by all.</p>
<p>The foundation believes "OER is a sustainable and renewable resource," but that "collaboration among education institutions will be a prerequisite for success."</p>
