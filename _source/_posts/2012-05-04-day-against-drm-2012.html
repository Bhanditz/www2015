<p>Today is Day Against DRM. If you don't already, you should know that DRM stands for Digital Rights Management (or probably more accurately, Digital Restrictions Management), and that we have <a href="https://creativecommons.org/tag/drm">blogged about this day before</a> for good reasons, including,</p>
<ul>
<li>DRM causes problems regarding fair use, lack of competition, privacy and security breaches, forced obsolescence, and more... (Read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Wikipedia article on DRM</a>.)</li>
<li>CC provides tools to make it <em>easier</em> for creators and owners to say what rights they reserve and permissions they grant -- maximizing sharing and collaboration. This is in stark contrast with DRM that uses technology to make it harder to share and collaborate.</li>
<li>CC licenses <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Is_Creative_Commons_involved_in_digital_rights_management_.28DRM.29.3F">do not allow</a> users of CC-licensed works to use DRM to prevent other users from taking advantage of the freedoms already granted by the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Defectivebydesign.org <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/node/2231">notes</a> that,</p>
<blockquote><p>While DRM has largely been defeated in downloaded music, it is a growing problem in the area of ebooks, where people have had their books restricted so they can't freely loan, re-sell or donate them, read them without being tracked, or move them to a new device without re-purchasing all of them. They've even had their ebooks deleted by companies without their permission.</p></blockquote>
