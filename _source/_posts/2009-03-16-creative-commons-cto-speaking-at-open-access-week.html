<p>Open Access Week at the University of Michigan is "a week-long, campus-wide exploration of Open Access."  And a discussion sponsored by the Michigan Library on this topic couldn't come at a better time; libraries are facing tough economic situations and the current political discourse around copyright and open access needs to be addressed.  Featured Commoner (on behalf of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12859">Michigan Libraries</a>) Molly Kleinman said it best on her personal blog <a href="http://mollykleinman.com/2009/03/04/open-access-week-at-um/">announcing</a> Open Access Week:</p>
<blockquote><p>First we have the return of the dreadful Fair Copyright In Research Works Act, which is opposed by just about everyone except commercial publishers, including 33 Nobel Laureates in science. Then comes the word that together Elsevier and LexisNexis earned over $1.5 billion US in profit in 2008. For Elsevier thatâ€™s an adjusted operating margin â€” a profit â€” of 33%. While universities across the country are facing budget cuts of 20% or more, Elsevier brings in 33% profits, largely on the backs of university libraries. And economic news more broadly indicates that no library will escape unscathed. When Harvard starts laying off librarians and eliminating subscriptions, weâ€™re all in trouble.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that is only a small sub-section of the issues facing libraries today, including big issues like the Google Books Settlement.  What better time to speak about the use of Creative Commons licenses in academic journals and what technological tools Creative Commons is developing to build an ecosystem of openness?  With the right tools and the right attitude academic libraries will be a major player in fixing many of these issues.</p>
<p>Nathan Yergler, CTO at Creative Commons, will be speaking during Open Access Week on March 23rd on the University of Michigan campus.  Everyone is welcome to join this event, and all of the events during Open Access Week.
