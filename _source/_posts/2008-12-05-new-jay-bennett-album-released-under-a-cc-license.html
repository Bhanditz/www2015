<p>Former Wilco member <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Bennett">Jay Bennett</a> is an incredibly talented singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer who has just put out his fifth solo album, <a href="http://rockproper.com/featured/whatever-happened-i-apologize.html"><em>Whatever Happened I Apologize</em></a>, as a free download under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">Attribution Noncommercial</a> license. For the release, Bennett is working with Rock Proper, an online distributor of CC-licensed music. The company has a great <a href="http://rockproper.com/about/">mission statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rock Proper seeks to enhance the lives of these artists by embracing the technologies of today. While not exactly a record label, Rock Proper is constantly vigilant; researching all possible channels of revenue that may allow these musicians to continue creating.</p>
<p>In the past, the ways we discovered music felt immediate and personal. Mix-tapes, fan-zines, underground radio, and uncle Johnâ€™s LP collection all celebrated music well beyond the boundaries of commerce. Like these old models, Rock Proper seeks to deliver music of integrity with immediacy and care.</p></blockquote>
