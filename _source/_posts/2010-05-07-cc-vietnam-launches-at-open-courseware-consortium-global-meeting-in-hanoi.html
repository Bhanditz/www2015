<p>Hanoi, Vietnam â€“ May 7, 2010</p>
<p>Today marks the celebration of the localized Creative Commons licenses in Vietnam, the fifty-third jurisdiction worldwide to adapt the Creative Commons licensing suite to national law. The Vietnam Education Foundation together with D&amp;N International and Creative Commons have overseen the localization of the licenses in consultation with the Vietnamese public and key stakeholders in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The launch will take place at the Creative Commons workshop on May 7 at 1:00pm during the Open CourseWare Consortium's (OCWC) fifth annual conference in Melia Hotel. The three-day OCWC event brings together educators, administrators, policy makers, and other interested participants to examine the capacity of Open CourseWare to effect large-scale educational improvement worldwide. Many Open CourseWare and Open Educational Resources (OER) use Creative Commons licenses to grant copyright permission to easily access, adapt, and discover the materials.</p>
<p>â€œAt a time when Vietnam Is taking great efforts to improve education and strengthen its creative industries, I see the Creative Commons launch providing a firm foundation on which to build Vietnam's education and creative sector in the digital age," says Dr. Lynne McNamara, Executive Director of the Vietnam Education Foundation. â€œWe greatly appreciate the support of the OCWC as well for making this event possible.â€</p>
<p>â€œCC Vietnam led a masterful consultation with the Vietnamese public and incorporated that feedback into the licenses. The team continues to connect diverse expertise and passions for the betterment of the local community. Creative Commons looks forward to the many promising developments in this dynamic and dedicated region,â€ notes Diane Peters, General Counsel of Creative Commons.</p>
<p>The next phase of CC Vietnam will focus on building multi-stakeholder groups to promote legal sharing in a variety of fields, such as photography, education, and music. Institutions and individuals in Vietnam are welcome to contribute to developing a roadmap for the national project and to join the launch's proceedings on May 7.</p>
