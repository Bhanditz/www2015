<p>We are excited to announce the launch of the official translation process for the 4.0 license suite.  As most of you know, CC made a significant push to make this latest version of the licenses as internationally robust as possible. The result is a set of licenses we hope will be used around the world. As part of that effort, we plan to publish official translations of the licenses in as many languages as possible, so that people around the world can read the legal code in their own languages. We will need the help of our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">affiliate network</a> and the larger CC community to accomplish this goal. </p>
<p>We have prepared a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy" target="_blank">formal translation process</a> to help us achieve such an ambitious undertaking. The process requires coordination across jurisdictions, as the goal is to create a single translation of any given language wherever possible. Communication and teamwork will be critical, as will attention to detail. (As with all CC official legal code, once published, it will be permanently locked per CCâ€™s long-standing commitment not to change the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_code">legal code</a> once published for adoption.) </p>
<p>The CC regional coordinators will be leading the translation teams and helping to organize the effort across jurisdictions. CC Legal will oversee each translation project to help ensure the official translations have the same legal meaning and effect as the original. To aid the effort, we have created <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy#Supporting_documents">several guides</a> designed to help translators complete the project. There is a translation guide, which will be continually updated with new tips and guidelines as we learn more throughout this process, a guide to building the other five licenses in the suite once the first license is translated, and a worksheet to help translators and CC Legal stay on the same page. </p>
<p>If you would like to get involved in this important internationalization effort, please contact a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Regional_Coordinators">CC regional coordinator</a>. </p>
