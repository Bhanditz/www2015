<p><i>Silicon Valley-based NGO reinforces its activities around the globe and introduces its innovative copyright licenses in Peru.</i></p>
<p><b>San Francisco, CA, USA; Berlin, GERMANY; and Lima, Peru â€” June 29, 2006</b> â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon today announced the launch of its licenses in Peru.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">groupâ€™s website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with a project leads Oscar Montezuma and Pedro Mendizabal in Peru to adapt the standardized licenses to Peruvian law. <a href="http://pe.creativecommons.org ">Creative Commons Peru</a> is hosted by <a href=" http://cpsr-peru.org">Computers Professionals for Social Responsibility - Peru (CPSR-Peru).</a></p>
<p>â€œThe Peruvian version of the Creative Commons licenses will be launched after the iLaw Program 2006 being held at Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru. Professor Lawrence Lessig of Stanford University, CEO & Chairman of Creative Commons, will deliver the keynote speech on the importance of Creative Commons Peruâ€, says Oscar Montezuma.</p>
<p>"CC has been very well received in Peru. It has quickly gained the interest of many individuals and institutions ranging from the private to public sector. Success has been such, that I think Peru can eventually become a promising global free culture spot in South Americaâ€œ.</p>
<p>"We are proud of the achievements of the Creative Commons community in Peru. This is a success for all Peruvian authors and creators,â€œ adds Pedro Mendizabal.</p>
<p>The President of the National Institute of Defense of the Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property (INDECOPI), Santiago Roca, greeted the launching of Creative Commons PerÃº, welcoming it as a legitimate exercise of authors that would allow them to grant universal access of their works, without the obligation of economic compensation.</p>
