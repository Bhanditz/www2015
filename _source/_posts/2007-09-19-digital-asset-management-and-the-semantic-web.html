<p>One way to think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Asset_Management">Digital Asset Management</a> is as "enterprise software" for media shops. Another is as the functional opposite of DRM -- DAM helps organizations deal with and make use of huge volumes of media, including of course tracking licensing, while DRM attempts to "deal" with users who might want to use individual pieces of media.</p>
<p>It isn't just media shops and large organizations that have large libraries of media to track and be able to use optimally in various productions. So I've been predicting for awhile that DAM-like features will rapidly filter down into "consumer" creator software. One vector for this is growing support for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/XMP">XMP</a>, which allows for embedding arbitrary metadata in media files (Adobe originated XMP, which is based on RDF, the core Semantic Web metadata technology).</p>
<p>Microsoft has apparently gone the next several steps by basing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/mediaandentertainment/solutions_imm.mspx">Microsoft Media Manager</a> on RDF and OWL. Via <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/microsoft_media_manager>Henry Story via <a href="http://davidseth.net/blog/archive/2007/07/11/Microsoft-is-convinced-of-the-semantic-web.aspx">David Seth</a>, who pulls these two quotes from the Media Manager site:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This RDF model allows companies to add nuance and intelligence to media management beyond what is possible with traditional metadata."<br />
"... Most importantly, the IMM RDF model overcomes traditional barriers to metadata sharing between external systems."</p></blockquote>
<p>That's great. Now it should be really easy to build support for CC licensing into the Media Manager, if it isn't there already. :)</p>
<p>Three recent and related pieces on the CC blog, if you read between the lines: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7589">Introducing Desktop Licensing</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7644">Your copyright metadata on a GRDDL</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7648">File Info panel for Adobe applications</a>.</p>
