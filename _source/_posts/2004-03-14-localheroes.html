<p>If you're at South by Southwest in Austin, come by our panels at 10am (music and copyright) and 11:30am (film and copyright) Monday morning. Special guests include two Austinites: tech-media renaissance man <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/wiggins">Wiley Wiggins</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contest/">GET CREATIVE! contest</a> winner Justin Cone, whose 2-minute short "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/movingimagecontest">Building on the Past</a>" perfectly exemplifies the CC mission. (How many films do you know of that involved zero in royalty costs?)</p>
