<p>This Tuesday, Feb 26th, the New York City Bar Association will be hosting a panel discussion titled, <a href="http://www.nycbar.org/EventsCalendar/show_event.php?eventid=808">"Is Intellectual Property Dead? The Revolt of Students for New Directions"</a>. The speaker list is phenomenal (including <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/alumni#44">CC alumni Fred Benenson</a>) and the panel promises to illuminate the issues a new generation of content creators/consumers face in relation to copyright law. From <a href="http://www.nycbar.org">NYCBar</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Students for Free Culture has chapters in at least 35 universities across the country. Many of the groups are branching out beyond access to music copyright. The issues are far more than piracy. Can the students lead us, in terms of public policy, to a new copyright direction in which copyright law will not make some users criminal?</p></blockquote>
