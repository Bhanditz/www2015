<p>The <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a>, "a grassroots education project that organizes learning outside of institutional walls" by leveraging social software and existing open educational resources,  launched its second pilot and a <a href="http://p2pu.org/">new website</a> today. The first pilot launched last September with seven courses, ranging from Creative Nonfiction Writing to Behavioral Economics. Due to high demand, P2PU has doubled its course offerings for the second round. From the <a href="http://blogs.p2pu.org/blog/2010/02/17/p2pu-has-landed/">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Some of the courses were offered in the first phase of the pilot which launched last September, but seven are brand new, including "<a href="http://p2pu.org/climate-resilient-cities-mar-2010">Urban Disaster Risk Management</a>," "<a href="http://p2pu.org/mashing-open-web-mar-2010">Mashing Up the Open Web</a>," and "<a href="http://p2pu.org/solve-anything-building-ideas-through-design-mar-2010">Solve Anything! Building Ideas through Design</a>." P2PU is also excited to announce its first Portuguese language courses organized by Brasil's Casa de Cultura Digital, one of which is an <a href="http://p2pu.org/intro-ao-pensamento-de-paulo-freire-mar-2010">introduction to the thinking of Paulo Freire</a> (educational theorist who is author of Pedagogy of the Oppressed). The P2PU community has grown and is excited to have these new courses and their organizers on board."</p>
<p>Since last November's workshop in Berlin, a few changes have taken place at P2PU. P2PU is still run and governed by volunteers, but the P2PU Council, with the support of the community, has elected Philipp Schmidt as its representing Director. Philipp is one of the co-founders of the project, as well as a Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow, which enables him to devote himself full time to P2PU. On becoming Director, Philipp says, "We have proven that the model works and are seeing tremendous interest from people all over the world to learn together. I am very excited to help guide the project through the next phase of growth and for the opportunity to work with the inspiring and talented volunteers that make P2PU so special."</p>
<p>When asked how P2PU will affect the education landscape, Council member Delia Browne says, "P2PU will revolutionize how people learn. It will help create a global open culture of learning for the 21st century."</p>
<p>The P2PU community consists of a diverse group of people. They are writers, teachers, designers, doctoral and alternative grad students, artists, copyright specialists, scientists, and blues guitar players. Above all, they are learners--peers working together to learn from each other."</p></blockquote>
