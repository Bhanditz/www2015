<p><a href="http://shareable.net/">Shareable</a>, the online magazine about sharing culture, is carrying out an innovation study and wants you to tell them how much you share in a short 15 minute <a href="http://latitudesurvey.com/ii09/II09login.html">survey</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The study will assess individuals' awareness of current shared  offerings, their attitudes about sharing and trust, and their engagement  with sharing across a variety of contexts. Participants will be  contributing to a relatively new and increasingly important knowledge  base. Moreover, they will be playing a critical role in helping to  generate new ideas and opportunities for the future of sharing. (Results  will be shared on both Shareable.net and Latitude's <a href="http://life-connected.com/">life-connected.com</a> in the coming  weeks.)</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the <a href="http://latitudesurvey.com/ii09/II09login.html">survey</a>, you'll get paid $10; you can choose to pocket it as an Amazon gift card or donate the cash towards the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22154">Catalyst Campaign</a> that's going on right now... or the Project for Public Spaces (we hope you'll choose CC!).</p>
<p>So help Shareable and CC out--<a href="http://latitudesurvey.com/ii09/II09login.html">take the survey</a>!</p>
