<p>As you may know, this Friday marks long-time CC leader and mainstay Neeru Paharia's last day as an official staffer.</p>
<p>I recently looked back at the internal newsletter I sent out to CC's staff and board the day Neeru started, August 12, 2002 -- almost exactly three years ago. This is how the newsletter started:</p>
<p>"Creative Commons' epic assistant director search has reached its happy end. Late last week Neeru Paharia became the newest member of the CC team. Neeru joins us from McKinsey & Company, the top-drawer management consultancy, where she worked as an associate on a wide range of business issues. A long-time Bay Area resident, Neeru studied economics at U.C. Davis before earning a spot in the highly competitive Coro Fellowship Program in Public Affairs. Neeru then went on to Carnegie Mellon University, where she earned an MS with highest honors in Public Policy and Management (with a concentration in management information systems) and a full-tuition Woodrow Wilson scholarship. No mere wonk, Neeru is also an illustrator, a blues guitarist of fifteen years, and a budding filmmaker whose work has played at various festivals. Management, policy, tech, and art -- plus a sharp wit and an easygoing way. An ideal new colleague."</p>
<p>The funny thing about this is that Neeru wildly exceeded . . . (change -- this sounds patronizing -- exactly the opposite of how it should sound).</p>
