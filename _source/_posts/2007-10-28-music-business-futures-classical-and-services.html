<p>Matt Haughey (CC's Creative Director 2002-2005) on <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2007/10/25/the-future-of-the-music-business/">how to see the future of the music business in today's classical music business</a>.</p>
<p>Lucas Gonze (worked on an early version of ccMixter in 2004) on the <a href="http://blog.gonze.com/2007/10/22/tour/">business of artist services</a>, see comments on followup posts (<a href="http://blog.gonze.com/2007/10/28/artist-services-roundup-6-in-the-series/">roundup</a>) for insightful discussion of the role of artists, artist services, labels, and tastemakers, featuring among others Victor Stone (<a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/victor">ccMixter leader and remixer</a>), Gurdonark (<a href="http://negativesoundinstitute.com/">ambient musician</a> and <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/gurdonark">ccMixter participant</a>), and Derek Sivers (<a href="http://cdbaby.com/">CDBaby</a>).</p>
<p>That was better than over 90% of music conference panels, and nobody had to fly anywhere.</p>
