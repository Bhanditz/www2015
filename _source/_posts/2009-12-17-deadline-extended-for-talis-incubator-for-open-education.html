<p>As an early <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/education/2009/12/17/an-early-xmas-present-from-the-talis-incubator/">xmas present</a>, Talis Education has extended the deadline for the Talis angel fund to January 31, 2010, one full month later than the original deadline to give you a chance to hone your proposals (or begin writing them after the holidays). If you don't remember, I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17005">blogged</a> about the Talis angel fund for open education in August when it launched:</p>
<p>"Talis Education launched an angel fund for open education, called the Talis Incubator for Open Education. Talis Education is providing funds up to â€œÂ£15,000 to help individuals or small groups who have big ideas about furthering the cause of Open Education. All Talis asks in return is that the project deliverables are â€˜open sourcedâ€™ and the intellectual property returned back to the community, allowing it to be used freely. Talis wonâ€™t, and never will, exert any rights to the intellectual property or ideas that are funded.â€</p>
