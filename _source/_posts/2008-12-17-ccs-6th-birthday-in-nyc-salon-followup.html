<p>Thanks to everyone who made it out to the <a href="http://www.foryourimagination.com">FYI</a> studio for our 6th Birthday last night in NYC. Despite battling the first snow storm of the season, the crowd enjoyed presentations from Ted & Jonathan of <a href="http://www.limebits.com">Limebits</a>, Michael from <a href="http://www.aviary.com">Aviary</a>, Spot of <a href="http://www.electricsheep.org">Electric Sheep</a> and an fantastic performance by <a href="http://www.sarahelizabethfoster.com/">Sarah Elizabeth Foster</a>. </p>
<p>Happy Birthday may or <a href="http://www.unhappybirthday.com">may not have been sung</a>, and many free beers were consumed. Check out Ben Sisto's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensisto/sets/72157611351669456/">free photos of the evening if you want to see more proof</a>.  </p>
<p>Special thanks goes to everyone who helped setup and break down, and especially to For Your Imagination for supplying their awesome studio space in the face of a intimidating RSVP list.</p>
