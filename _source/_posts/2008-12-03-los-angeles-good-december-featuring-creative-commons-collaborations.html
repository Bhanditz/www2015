<p>If you're in Los Angeles over the next two weeks, <a href="http://www.good.is/">GOOD</a> is hosting a series called GOOD December from Friday, 12/5 through Friday 12/19 in their new space on Melrose Avenue. It's open to the public from 11am-5pm every day and will offer salons, panel discussions, meals, and more. There will be occasional parties in the evening hours that require an RSVP; check out the <a href="http://awesome.goodmagazine.com/december/">GOOD December site</a> for more details. There's also a nice write-up about it at <a href="http://flavorpill.com/losangeles/events/2008/12/5/good-december">Flavorpill</a> with some useful info.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is collaborating with GOOD on two of the ongoing pieces of the series. One is an installation of <a href="http://intoinfinity.org">Into Infinity</a> - the art and music project we're producing with <a href="http://dublab.com/">Dublab</a>. The other is a set of podcast interviews about the culture of sharing that I conducted with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hughes_(Facebook)">Chris Hughes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_DiBona">Chris Dibona</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curt_Smith">Curt Smith</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito">Joi Ito</a> and a variety of other luminaries who use sharing as a cornerstone to work they do across a variety of fields. Snippets of the interviews will be running throughout the series' two weeks - grab a set of headphones and listen up!</p>
