<p>HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory) announced a new report called, "<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/Future_of_Learning.pdf">The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age</a>," now available at MIT Press. The report is in response to our changing times, and addresses what traditional educational institutions must know to keep up. From the <a href="http://www.hastac.org/node/2238">announcement</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Cathy N. Davidson and David Theo Goldberg in an abridged version of their book-in-progress, The Future of Thinking: Learning Institutions in a Digital Age, argue that traditional institutions must adapt or risk a growing mismatch between how they teach and how this new generation learns. Forms and models of learning have evolved quickly and in fundamentally new directions. Yet how we teach, where we teach, who teaches, and who administers and serves have changed only around the edges. This report was made possible by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in connection with its grant making initiative on Digital Media and Learning."</p></blockquote>
<p>A central finding was that "Universities must recognize this new way of learning and adapt or risk becoming obsolete. The university model of teaching and learning relies on a hierarchy of expertise, disciplinary divides, restricted admission to those considered worthy, and a focused, solitary area of expertise. However, with participatory learning and digital media, these conventional modes of authority break down."</p>
<p>Not coincidentally, one of the ten principles for redesigning learning institutions was open source education: "Traditional learning environments convey knowledge via overwhelmingly copyright-protected publications. Networked learning, contrastingly, is an â€œopen sourceâ€ culture that seeks to share openly and freely in both creating and distributing knowledge and products."</p>
