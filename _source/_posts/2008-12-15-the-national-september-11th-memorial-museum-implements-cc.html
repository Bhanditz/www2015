<p>On Friday December 5th, <a href="http://www.national911memorial.org/">the National September 11 Memorial & Museum</a> launched its <a href="http://registry.national911memorial.org/">Artists Registry</a>. The registry provides a virtual gallery of art created in response to the attacks of September 11, and includes contributions made by a diverse artistic community using varied media â€“ visual, tactile and auditory.  Most excitingly from CC's perspective <a href="http://registry.national911memorial.org/license.php">is that the registry offers full support</a> of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses">our 6 licenses</a>. When uploading a work artists have the option to select a license and the work's resulting metadata and RDFa will be displayed when the it is shown in the online galleries.</p>
<p>Not only has National September 11th Memorial Museum encouraged user submissions into its collection, but by using our licenses, it has done so in a progressive and socially responsible fashion.  We look forward to seeing more institutions like the Memorial Museum integrating CC into their mission and offerings, so it is great to see such an innovative implementation leading the pack.</p>
