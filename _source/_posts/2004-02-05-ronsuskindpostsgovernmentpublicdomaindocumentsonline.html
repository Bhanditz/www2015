<p>Government documents supplied by Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Ron Suskind for his book, <a href="http://thepriceofloyalty.ronsuskind.com/">The Price of Loyalty</a>, are now available <a href="http://thepriceofloyalty.ronsuskind.com/thebushfiles/">online</a>.  The site makes use of the Creative Commons public domain mark.  </p>

These documents, drawn from a collection of 19,000 files, are called "The Bush Files" and Suskind is encouraging other administration officials to contribute to the database, "to encourage more productive, fact-based public dialogues," as stated on the website.</p>
