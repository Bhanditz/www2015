<p><em>"Remix, Redistribute, Rejoice"</em> reads the emboldening tag line from the <a href="http://footage.stealthisfilm.com/">footage archive</a> of  <a href="http://stealthisfilm.com/Part2/">STEAL THIS FILM II</a>, a documentary that explores shifts in technology, distribution, and creative production.  The recently <a href="http://knowfuture.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/httpfootagestealthisfilmcom/">released</a> footage includes three hours of material from eleven interviews, all of which are released for your remixing pleasure under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA license</a>.</p>
<p>Not only are the interviews available in high quality format to users and <em>produsers</em>, but thanks to the help of many volunteers, it is possible to conduct a full text search of the base material, which will guide you to the frame  and immediate context of your search term.</p>

Since then, it has been subtitled in 19 languages and is estimated to have been viewed by over 4 million people -- 150,000 of whom had downloaded the film in the first three days of its release.</p>
