<p>We're very excited to announce that Creative Commons will be part of <a href="http://www.google.com/policyfellowship/index.html">Google's Policy Fellowship</a> for this coming summer.  The Google Policy Fellow will receive a substantial grant to work at Creative Commons on the following issues (but this is certainly not an exhaustive list of the things we'll have you thinking about):</p>
<ul>
<li>Write case studies about projects and creators that have implemented Creative Commons licenses and analyze strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for each; paying particular consideration to cultural and genre differences.</li>
<li>Synthesize statistics garnered from recent studies focusing on international license adoption. Fellow will be expected to generate and investigate diverse theses relating to license choice, adoption, and use.</li>
<li>Coordinate with counsel to critically analyze the current state of public domain policy in US and abroad. Develop a framework to help Creative Commons' deploy messaging regarding public domain policy in US and abroad.</li>
<li>Survey the current legal and non-legal opinions with respect to the 'strong vs. weak' copyleft debate and how it relates to differences between mediums (photography, music, etc.) in order to establish guidelines and uncover precedent for our ShareAlike licenses.</li>
<li>Research and analysis of how contemporary the discourse of copyright, sharing, reuse, and remix has been shaped over the last six years as a result of the Creative Commons project.</li>
<li>Investigate new opportunities for Creative Commons implementation in 'uncontacted' communities, institutions, artists, and mediums.</li>
</ul>
