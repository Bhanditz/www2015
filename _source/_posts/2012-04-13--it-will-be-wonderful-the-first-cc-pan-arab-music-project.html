<p>â€Ÿ<a href="http://itwillbewonderful.org">It Will Be Wonderful</a>â€ is a peer-produced music project that brings together Arab and international musicians. Artists from different musical genres (hip-hop, rap, jazz, folk music) met in Tunis in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28063">July, 2011</a> to celebrate the creativity and innovation brought by Arab youth to the Arab revolutions which erupted in Tunisia in December, 2010 and spread across the region. The project was hosted as part of the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.qa/tunis">third CC Arab regional meeting</a> in cooperation with Tunisian blogger platform <a href="http://www.nawaat.org">Nawaat</a> and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.net">Al Jazeera Networks</a>. An artists` residence lasted three days, and musicians were encouraged to create original music collectively, each infusing the project with his/her own musical genre. The culmination was a three hour concert entitled, "Sharing the Spring," performed in the beautiful location of Nejma Ezzahra, and two original songs were created and played: â€œMamnou`â€ (Forbidden) and â€œThawra Mustamirraâ€ (Ongoing revolution). Since then, these songs have been re-arranged, recorded and post-produced professionally. More artists have added their voices and sounds, and the result is now available to be shared and remixed freely under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a>.</p>
<h3>Remix competition</h3>
<p>"It Will Be Wonderful" is available for everyone all over the world to <a href="http://itwillbewonderful.org/__/download.html">download</a> and build on it. We will publish the best remixes in a CC-licensed CD/book/DVD. We also hope to have a party in an Arab capital to celebrate the project where the best remixers will be invited to join.</p>
<p>Some of the members of the "It Will Be Wonderful" music collective will be performing in Rome on April 16th in the stunning location of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis">Ara Pacis museum</a>. We look forward to organizing more live shows and invite the best remixers to join us on a global "It Will Be Wonderful" tour!</p>
