<p>Following up on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7573">an earlier post</a>, we are pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/">PodTech</a>, a technology and entertainment video network, has donated to Creative Commons on top of the money already paid to Lan Bui for his CC-licensed photograph.</p>
<p>In doing so, PodTech has set a precedent in paying Bui for his photo and have further committed their belief in CC licences through their  donation. In taking responsibility for their use of CC-licensed content, PodTech lays a foundation for others to follow and their support of CC's mission and ideals is commendable.</p>
