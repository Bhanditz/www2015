<p>Austria now has a music platform, <a href="http://www.orangemusic.at/">Orange Music</a>, featuring exclusively CC licensed music with over 88 bands on board for launch day. Orange Music seems to accept submissions rather readily, and while the platform focuses primarily on Austrian groups, international contributions seem welcome as well.</p>
