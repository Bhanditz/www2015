<p><img src="img/spotus_header_logo.jpg" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" /><a href="http://spot.us/">Spot.Us</a>, a nonprofit project from the <a href="http://www.centerformediachange.com/">Center for Media Change</a> that aims to pioneer â€œcommunity funded reportingâ€ (previous coverage <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10785">here</a>), is expanding to Los Angeles! From <a href="http://blog.spot.us/2009/09/22/spot-us-expands-to-l-a-with-annenberg-and-a-10-month-state-of-the-spot/">Spot.Us</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spot.Us is expanding to Los Angeles and we are doing so with USCâ€™s Annenberg School of Journalism. Needless to say, we are very excited about the opportunities and possibilities. The main Spot.Us homepage will aggregate pitches from both the SF Bay Area and Los Angeles regions. You can go to Subdomains to find pitches specific to those regions: la.spot.us and sfbay.spot.us.</p></blockquote>
<p>The move is a collaboration between Spot.Us and <a href="http://annenberg.usc.edu/">USCâ€™s Annenberg School of Journalism</a> and could pave the way for additional cities to be added to the Spot.US umbrella in the near future.
