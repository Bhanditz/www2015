<p>India has launched a new learning repository for open educational resources (OER). India's Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, and the Central Institute of Educational Technology, National Council of Educational Research and Training have collaboratively developed the <a href="http://nroer.in/home/">National Repository of Open Educational Resources</a> (NROER). Dr. Pallam Raju, India's Minister for Human Resource Development, <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-08-13/news/41371845_1_school-education-m-m-pallam-raju-school-system">launched</a> the repository on Tuesday, and Dr. Shashi Tharoor, India's Minister of State for Human Resource Development, <a href="http://tharoor.in/speeches/launch-of-national-repository-of-open-education-resources-nroer/">announced</a> the repository's default license for all resources -- Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>). </p>
<p>The repository currently includes videos, audio, interactive media, images, and documents, and aims to "bring together all digital and digitisable resources for the [Indian] school system â€“ for all classes, for all subjects and in all languages." </p>
<p>From Dr. Tharoor's <a href="http://tharoor.in/speeches/launch-of-national-repository-of-open-education-resources-nroer/">announcement</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>This initiative is also a significant step towards inclusive education. Opening access to all requires a debate on the issue of ownership, copyright, licensing and a balancing of reach with legitimate commercial interests. This is particularly important for public institutions and public funded projects. I am glad that the NCERT has taken the initiative of declaring that the NROER will carry the CC-BY-SA license... This decision by NCERT is in tune with UNESCOâ€™s Paris Declaration on Open Education Resources and will ensure that all the resources are freely accessible to all. To put it in the language of the Creative Commons â€” to reuse, revise, remix and redistribute. </p></blockquote>
<p>To contribute to the repository, one must ensure that they are "agreeing to host the resources under a Creative Commons license" (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>) and "that the documents uploaded are encoded using non-proprietary, open standards."
