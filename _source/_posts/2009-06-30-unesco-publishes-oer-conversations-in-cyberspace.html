<p>In case you missed it, last Friday UNESCO published "Open Educational Resources: Conversations in Cyberspace", three years worth of documentation surrounding the UNESCO OER Community. From their <a href="http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=28899&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html">announcement</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Since 2005, UNESCO has been at the forefront of building awareness about this movement by facilitating an extended conversation in cyberspace. A large and diverse international community has come together to discuss the concept and potential of OER in a series of online forums.</p>
<p>The background papers and reports from the first three years of discussions are now available in print. Open Educational Resources: Conversations in Cyberspace provides an overview of the first steps of this exciting new development: it captures the conversations between leaders of some of the first OER projects,and documents early debates on the issues that continue to challenge the movement. The publication will provide food for thought for all those intrigued by OER â€“ its promise and its progress."</p></blockquote>
