<p>Over on our <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">Mixter</a> site, we're nearing the closing date on the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/wired">Fine Art of Sampling contests</a>. Saturday, Feburary 12th is the last day to submit your entries into <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/freestylemix">The Freestyle Mix</a> contest pool and the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/militiamix">Militia Mix</a> pools.</p>
<p>The top prize on the Freestyle Mix will be appearing on an upcoming mix CD released by Creative Commons, while the best Militia Mix track will end up on the Fine Arts Militia's next album.
