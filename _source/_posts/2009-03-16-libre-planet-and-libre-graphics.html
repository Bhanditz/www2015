<p>This coming weekend (March 21-22) in Cambridge, Massachusetts the Free Software Foundation is holding its annual meeting, dubbed the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/">Libre Planet Conference</a>. Many of CC's best friends and supporters will be there, as will CC staff <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#83">Asheesh Laroia</a> and I. If you aren't familiar with the significance of the free software movement to free culture, start by checking out the links on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9112">post celebrating the former's 25th birthday</a>, or better yet come to Libre Planet. The conference will feature the hottest issues in software freedom, some of which <a href="http://autonomo.us/2008/07/franklin-street-statement/">include a free culture component</a>.</p>
<p>Another important conference is coming to the eastern part of North America -- the <a href="http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2009/">Libre Graphics Meeting</a>, May 6-9 in Montreal. Developers of the most important free software graphics applications will be represented. These applications are heavily used by contributors to free culture sites such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8328">Wikimedia Commons</a> and many of the <a href="http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2009/project.php">developers</a> engage in cutting edge free cultural productions themselves, e.g., <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8223">Blender</a>. CC staff have <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7450">attended</a> in years past and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#53">Jon Phillips</a> is <a href="http://rejon.org/projects/libre-graphics-meeting/">helping</a> put together this one.</p>
