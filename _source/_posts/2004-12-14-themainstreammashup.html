<p>"<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/12MAIN.html">The Mainstream Mash-Up</a>" makes it onto the New York Times' list of great ideas of 2004. Question #1: Where is Creative Commons here? Don't they read <a href="http://creativecommons.org">WIRED</a> at the NYTimes? Question #2: How "mainstream" is a concocted mash-up between Linkin Park + Jay-Z? Hats off to them for innovating, but this is just the tip of the iced-down Rolex.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5162">the Fine Art of Sampling contest</a>, starting here soon, for the real deal.</p>
