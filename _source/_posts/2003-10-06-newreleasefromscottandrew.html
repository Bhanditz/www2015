Scott Andrew LePera, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/musicians">previously interviewed</a> for our Featured Commoner piece on unsigned musicians, <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/main/2003_10#a000825">has released a new CD</a>. The songs on the new disc are all Creative Commons licensed and he's done something interesting with the pricing. You can pay as little as $5 for the new release, but anything beyond the minimum during the month of October will be donated to <a href="http://www.downhillbattle.org/defense/">downhill battle</a>, the P2P legal defense fund for people recently hit with lawsuits from the RIAA.</p>
