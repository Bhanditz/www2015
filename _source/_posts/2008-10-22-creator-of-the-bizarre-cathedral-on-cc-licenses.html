<p><a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/user/8833">Ryan Cartwright</a>, creator of webcomic <em><a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/taxonomy/term/1395">The Bizarre Cathedral</a></em>, recently posted an <a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/why_bizarre_cathedral_licence_non_free">insightful and thought-provoking piece</a> on why he uses a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a> on all <em>Bizarre Cathedral</em> comics. From <a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/why_bizarre_cathedral_licence_non_free">Cartwright</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[B]y restricting some freedom in distribution, it protects greater freedoms for the end-users. This is why I chose CC-BY-NC-SA for the Bizarre Cathedral.</p>
<ul>
<li>BY because I want people who receive one cartoon to be able to enjoy the rest here at FSM.</li>
<li>SA because I want everyone to enjoy the same access to the strips</li>
<li>NC because I want people to enjoy these at no cost. I am paid for creating them, so I want them to be enjoyed at no cost.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cartwright wrote the piece in response to criticism centered around the argument that his license choice (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>) was "non-free." We're always interested in this sort of dialogue, so insight like this - as well as insight from those critical of our licenses - is invaluable.</p>
