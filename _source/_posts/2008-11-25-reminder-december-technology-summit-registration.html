<p>Just a quick reminder that registration is still open for the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12">December Technology Summit</a> taking place in Cambridge, MA.Â  The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12#Program">program</a> looks like a great set of presentations about technology that touches CC: RDFa, digital copyright registries, embedded metadata and more.</p>
<p>Registration is <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/civicrm/event/register?id=1&amp;reset=1">available online</a> and we've added student rates at about half the normal rate: $40 or $25 for students who are also CC Network members (plus the option to buy both at the same time). Hope to see you there!</p>
