<p>Silicon-Valley-based NGO reinforces its activities around the globe</p>
<p>San Francisco, CA, USA and Berlin, GERMANY â€” July 1, 2005 â€” Creative<br />
Commons, a nonprofit organization dedicated to building a body of creative<br />
work free to share and build upon, announced today the launch of the Creative<br />
Commons project in Chile.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the<br />
groupâ€™s website (<a href="http://creativecommons.org">http://creativecommons.org</a>). The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>In a collaborative effort between the University of Chile and the Chilean NGO<br />
Corporacion Derechos Digitales (CDD), Creative Commons Chile adapted the<br />
licenses for use under Chilean lawâ€”a process headed by project leads Professor<br />
Alberto Cerda Silva, Gabriela Oruzar and Claudio Ruiz.</p>
<p>â€œWe hope to encourage discussion about the relevance and convenience of a<br />
balanced copyright for the artistic creations,â€œ says Claudio Ruiz. â€œIn our<br />
developing countries, the discussion about copyright and its limitations and<br />
exemptions must be part of the public agenda. â€œ</p>
<p>About the University of Chile and the Corporacion Derechos Digitales (CDD)</p>
<p>The University of Chile is, with its 162 years of existence, the oldest national<br />
university in Chile. It consists of 14 Schools and 4 Interdisciplinary Institutes.<br />
Research and creation of new knowledge is a main focus of this leading<br />
institution.</p>

organization, located in Santiago de Chile, whose mission is to promote the respect and protection of human rights in the digital environment.
