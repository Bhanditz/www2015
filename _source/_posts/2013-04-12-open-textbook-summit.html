<p>On April 8 &amp; 9, 2013 BCcampus hosted, and Creative Commons facilitated, an Open Textbook Summit in Vancouver British Columbia Canada. The Open Textbook Summit brought together government representatives, student groups, and open textbook developers in an effort to coordinate and leverage open textbook initiatives. </p>

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34288" target="_blank">California</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34566" target="_blank">British Columbia</a> recently announced initiatives to create open textbooks for high enrollment courses. Susan Brown in her welcoming remarks on behalf of the Deputy Minister of Advanced Education, Innovation and Technology noted the Open Textbook Summit was "a unique opportunity to share information about the work underway in our respective jurisdictions and organizations to capitalize on lessons learned; to identify common areas of interest; and to discover potential opportunities for collaboration. The real power of a project like this is only realized by working together."</p>
<p>On the summit's first day the BC government announced it was "<a href="http://www.newsroom.gov.bc.ca/2013/04/moving-to-the-next-chapter-on-free-online-textbooks.html" target="_blank">Moving to the next chapter on free online textbooks</a>" releasing a list of the 40 most highly enrolled first and second-year subject areas in the provincial post-secondary system. </p>
<p>Over the course of the summit participants identified existing open textbooks that could be used for BC's high enrollment courses. Development plans for creating additional open textbooks were mapped out. Strategies for academic use of open textbooks were discussed ranging from open textbooks for high enrollment courses to zero textbook degree programs where every course in a credential has an open textbook.</p>
<p>Open textbook developers described the tools they are using for authoring, editing, remixing, repository storage, access, and distribution. Participants discussed the potential for creating synergy between initiatives through use of common tools and processes.</p>
<p>Measures of success, including saving students money and improved learning outcomes, were shared and potential for a joint open textbook research agenda explored. The summit concluded with suggestions from all participants on ways to collaborate going forward. David Porters recommendation of an ongoing Open Textbook Federation was enthusiastically endorsed.</p>
<p>Mary Burgess created a Google group called <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/the-open-textbook-federation" target="_blank">The Open Textbook Federation</a> for further conversations and collaborations. This group is open to anyone currently working on, or thinking of working on, an Open Textbook Project. Notes from the Open Textbook Summit are posted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8CQcQ6uHfcPSU6_2XIfT_jbBYM--poB7XEEDjoNOug/edit?pli=1" target="_blank">online</a>. Clint Lalonde created a Storify of the <a href="http://storify.com/clintlalonde/bc-open-textbook-summit" target="_blank">Twitter conversation</a> captured during the summit.</p>
<p>The Open Textbook Summit was an incredible day and a half of learning. The sharing of insights, experiences, hopes, and ideas left everyone energized with a commitment to join together in a cross-border federation that collaborates on open textbooks.</p>
