<p>This week we'll roll out several potential innovations to our licenses, then call for your comments. First, we'll post some proposed text for two new kinds of license options:  "sampling" and "educational use."  Second, we'll float some draft language that we've considered adding to our licenses as enhancements:  an explicit safe harbor for search engines under our "noncommercial" condition;  a clear distinction between privacy-enhancing encryption tools and over-reaching digital rights management; and a potential link requirement as an addition to our "attribution" provision.</p>
<p>We plan to post around one draft provision a day this week; by the end of the week, we'll have upgraded our blog so that you can share comments with other readers.  Please weigh in:  Let us know if you think the proposed enhancements and options are worth it, and if so, how we might improve the specific language of each.</p>
<p>Note:  We're not changing or versioning the licenses -- not yet, anyway.  We hope through this process simply to vet publicly issues that a few of you have raised via email, and to explore how Creative Commons and our adopters might best work together as our project grows.  After a healthy comment period, we'll take stock and move on from there.</p>
