<p>The newest license draft adapted to Irish law is ready for public discussion.  A previous version of this license was published and opened for discussion and we are now seeking comments on the latest revised version. </p>
<p>To contribute a review or question regarding the license draft adapted to Irish law, please visit the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ireland/3.0/BY-NC-SA/Draft">BY-NC-SA 3.0 license draft page</a> and click on the wikiâ€™s discussion page to share your thoughts. You are also welcome to join and write to the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-ie">CC Ireland mailing list</a>, which will run in parallel to the wiki.</p>
<p>The public discussion is an open forum where everyone â€“ from lawyers to active license users, from linguists to translators â€” is invited to contribute and improve the license texts. Comments should be submitted as soon as possible to allow enough time for review, so we encourage you to post to the list before the end of March 2011, when the discussion is scheduled to close.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ongoing efforts of Project Leads Darius Whelan and Louise Crowley with the support of <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/law">University College Cork</a>.  We look forward to the discussion!</p>
<p>While CC is winding down porting as we prepare for version 4.0, we're excited to see this work come to fruition given CC Ireland's extensive work on the licenses.  A huge thank you to the entire CC Ireland team for all their hard work.</p>
