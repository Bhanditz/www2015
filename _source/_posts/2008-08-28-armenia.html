<p>Eurasia Partnership Foundationâ€™s (EPF) mission is to empower people to effect change for social justice and economic prosperity through hands-on programs, helping them to improve their communities and their own lives. Through its foundations, registered locally in <a href="http://epfound.am/">Armenia</a>, <a href="http://epfound.az/">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="http://epfound.ge/">Georgia</a>, EPF raises and delivers seed capital to emerging civil society organizations. EPF is both a grant maker and a program implementer and is guided by five program mandates and approaches: Creating Opportunities for Civic and Economic Participation; Building Capacity for Evidence-Based Research to Improve Policy-Making; Fostering a Culture of Corporate and Community Philanthropy; Cross-Border Cooperation; and Open Door Grant Making.</p>
<p>In May 2008, EPF in cooperation with CC has started the â€œSupport to Caucasus Creative Commonsâ€ program that aims at establishing CC licensing framework in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.  The program will enable and popularize the legal sharing and reuse of cultural, educational, and scientific works in the countries of the South Caucasus through offering free and easy-to-use Creative Commons licensing framework to creators, artists, and educators, as well as other internet-based communities in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.  The program will harness further intellectual activity in the South Caucasus, will potentially provide a newer mechanism for economic activity, and, at the same time, will enhance opportunities for cross-border collaboration among creative communities in the South Caucasus and beyond.</p>
