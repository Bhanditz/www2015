<p>Attention all remixers: the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/fortminor/">Fort Minor Remix Contest</a> over at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> starts accepting entries today. We're really excited to hear what you all have been cooking up since we posted the Creative Commons-licensed source material online two weeks ago. You have from now until May 6 to post your hottest track and compete to win a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SL-1200">Technics SL-1200MK5</a> turntable, courtesy of <a href="http://www.warnerbrosrecords.com/">Warner Bros. Records</a> and <a href="http://www.machineshoprecordings.com/">Machine Shop Recordings</a>.</p>
