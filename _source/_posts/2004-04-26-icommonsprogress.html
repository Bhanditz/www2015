<p>In the first quarter of the current year, iCommons has made significant progress in porting the CC licences - based on US-copyright law - to other jurisdictions, thereby internationalizing the movement. By early April, three European countries (Germany, Croatia and the Netherlands) as well as Australia and Jordan had come up with the first drafts of their respective licences. Austria and South Africa are scheduled to be next. In total, some sixteen jurisdictions have now launched their final or preliminary drafts.</p>
