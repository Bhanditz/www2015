<p>Today we're launching the first packaged release of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tools/ccpublisher">ccPublisher</a> 2, Developer Preview 1 (DP1).  DP1 is exactly what it sounds like -- a preview.  This isn't even beta code, folks, but we need to get stuff tested and we need to get feedback.  So what's new in ccPublisher 2?  Well, most of the code is completely new, and we've done lots of work to make it easier to extend, customize and maintain ccPublisher.  End users will probably see lots of regressions in this release, and that's something we need help identifying.</p>
<p>So, to answer your questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where can I get this wonderful code?<br />I'm working on releases as I write this, and I'll be updating this post throughout the day as new builds are tested and uploaded.  Right now you can find Linux download links <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CcPublisher_2_Releases">in the wiki</a>.  Windows and Mac OS X will be available <strike>within a day, tops.</strike> real soon now; we've run into a couple packaging problems which I'm working on.  If you want the gruesome details, check out <a href="http://yergler.net/blog/archives/2005/09/08/ccpublisher-python-and-xml">this blog entry</a>.</li>
<li>What should I expect?<br />We've done some basic, end-to-end testing, and have been able to successfully upload some items to the Internet Archive with these releases.  That said, I'm sure there are bugs, so give the code a try, but <em>back up the media files you're uploading ifrst</em>.  Seriously.</li>
<li>Hey, I found a bug!<br />
Great!  You can help by adding it to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CcPublisher_2_Problems">the list in the wiki</a>.  I'll be watching that page and using it to plan fixes and updates; I'll also add notes as I confirm bugs or fix them.  You can also add suggestions or regressions there.</li>
<li>So what's next?<br />
First, we need to get Windows and Linux builds out the door.  Then we're on to improving the code.  We'll have at least one (probably two) more releases before 2.0 ships.  Depending on how many bug reports come in, we'll try to ship the next pre-release next week.
</li>
<li>How can I help?<br />
Try the code, report bugs, or try to confirm bugs others report.  If you want to help with the actual guts, find me in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Developer#Chat">#cc IRC channel</a> (nathany) or email the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Developer#Chat">cc-devel</a> mailing list.  We'll use your help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to everyone who's tried, used and abused ccPublisher up to this point -- I'm excited about new developments, and I hope you are too.</p>
