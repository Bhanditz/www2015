<p>"Once again, Pearl Jam is taking the lead, watching others in the rear view mirror," says Lawrence Lessig, CEO of Creative Commons. "Pearl Jam's decision to offer its new video to the public under a Creative Commons license proves that the band's reputation for fan-friendliness is well deserved. It's an inspiration to those of us who are passionate about building a pool of creative work that can be freely and legally shared by the world."</p>
<p>Pearl Jam and J Records are offering the video as a free download at <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> and <a href="http://pearljam.com">PearlJam.com</a> from today, May 19th, through May 24th. After May 24th, the clip will be made available for sale.</p>
