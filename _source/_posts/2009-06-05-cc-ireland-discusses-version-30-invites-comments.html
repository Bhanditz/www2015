The CC Ireland team, lead by Dr. Darius Whelan and Louise Crowley and hosted at theÂ <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.ucc.ie');" href="http://www.ucc.ie/law/">University College Cork</a>, has been working with <a href="../international/">Creative Commons International</a> to port the licenses to local copyright legislation. Prior to this work, the Irish team prepared its national licenses at Version 2.0; however, Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249">introduced Version 3.0</a> before CC Ireland launched. Since that time, the Irish team has been developing Version 3.0 licenses and addressing pertinent legal issues.</p>
<p>The public discussion is a key part of Creative Commons' license porting project. It is an opportunity for you, content creators and license users, to engage in the drafting process and give your input on this collaborative effort. We warmly invite you to <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-ie/" target="_blank">join CC Irelandâ€™s discussion list</a> or <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/law/irishlaw/creativecommons/">visit their website</a> and share your comments with local and international legalÂ experts.</p>
<p><em>Thank you and congratulations to CC Ireland!</em></p>
