<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.gifttrap.com/">GiftTRAP</a> (who we recentlly featured <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7705">here</a>) are running a <a href="http://www.gifttrap.com/creative_commons_fund_raiser">Creative Commons Fundraiser Holiday Promotion</a>, where a purchase of "GiftTRAP California Edition" will result in $15 donated to CC, and a case of "GiftTRAP California Edition" (8 copies) will mean $100 donated.</p>
<p>A huge thanks is due to GiftTRAP for this awesome idea, which comes right in time for our <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/">2007 fundraising campaign</a>. We are on our way to reaching our goal, and every bit helps. Thanks GiftTRAP! Don't hesitate to spread the word by telling your fellow commoners about this awesome promotion.<br />
