<p><a href="http://droppingknowledge.org">Dropping Knowledge</a> has announced that it will soon offer over 600 hours of audio-visual material from the recent <a href="http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,436648,00.html">Table of Free Voices</a> event under a Creative Commons license. The Table of Free Voices took place in Berlin, Germany on September 9, 2006. At this historic gathering, more than 100 esteemed artists, academics, entrepreneurs, scientists, and activists gathered to answer questions about the state of the world. The recorded results will be published online as the Living Library and offered to the world under CC terms.</p>
<p>This rich archive of thought will certainly be a valuable addition to the commons. Very exciting stuff!</p>
