<p>While mainstream attention has been focused on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>, the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home">Open Educational Resource university (OERu)</a> has been developing a parallel education offering which is distinctively open.</p>
<p>The OERu aims to provide free learning to all students worldwide using OER learning materials with pathways to gain credible qualifications from recognized education institutions.</p>
<p>Like MOOCs, the OERu will have free open enrollment. But OERu's open practices go well beyond open enrollment.</p>
<p>The OERu uses an open peer review model inviting open public input and feedback on courses and programs as they are being designed. At the beginning of 2013, the New Zealand Qualifications Authority approved a new <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Another_world_first_for_Otago_Polytechnic:_OP_to_offer_full_credential_for_the_OERu">Graduate Diploma in Tertiary Education</a> to be developed as OER and offered as part of OERu offerings. OERu recently published the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Planning/OERu_2013_Prototype/Open_education_practice/Design_blueprint">design blueprint</a> and requested public input and feedback for the Open Education Practice elective, one of a number of blueprints for OERu courses.</p>
<p>OERu course materials are licensed using Creative Commons licenses (CC-BY or CC-BY-SA) and based solely on OER (including open textbooks). In addition, OERu course materials are designed and developed using open file formats (easy to revise, remix, and redistribute) and delivered using open-source software.</p>
<p>The OERu network offers assessment and credentialing services through its partner educational institutions on a cost-recovery basis. Through the community service mission of OERu participating institutions, OER learners have open pathways to earn formal academic credit and pay reduced fees for assessment and credit.</p>

<p>Open peer review, open public input, open educational resources, open textbooks, open file formats, open source software, open enrollments - the OERu is distinctively open. </p>
<p>Congratulations to the OERu on its second anniversary and its upcoming international launch in November.</p>
