<p>If you are serious about a Creative Commons project idea, you may be interested in the free, online course, "<a href="http://p2pu.org/general/getting-your-cc-project-funded">Getting your CC project funded</a>," set to run in April. The course consists of a series of workshops and seminars that will take you through the steps from an initial idea to having a finished project proposal for submission, including assistance in identifying and finding funding bodies and collaborations relevant for your project. You provide the idea; the course provides the guidance to turn it into a proposal that can't be refused.</p>
<p>The course will be run by <a href="http://jonasoberg.net/about-me">Jonas Ã–berg</a> from the <a href="http://cloudberry.cc/about">Nordic CC network</a>, a lecturer at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden with extensive grant writing and reviewing experience with the European Commission and several Nordic cultural foundations. "<a href="http://p2pu.org/general/getting-your-cc-project-funded">Getting your CC project funded</a>" will run on the Peer 2 Peer University (<a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a>) in April, and we especially invite CC Affiliates and friends to participate! </p>
<p>As with all P2PU courses, the course is free to take. Though only 15 active participants will be accepted into the course, the entire course, material, and other information, including the proposals which you write in the course, will be open for anyone to follow on the P2PU platform under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> license.</p>
<p>You can read more at <a href="http://p2pu.org/general/getting-your-cc-project-funded">http://p2pu.org/general/getting-your-cc-project-funded</a>. You may start brainstorming at anytime, but official sign-up opens March 31.</p>
<p><strong>If you already have experience writing and reviewing funding proposals</strong>... you may be interested in joining the team of expert external reviewers. More info on the current team is available on our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Funding_Course#Expert_reviewers">wiki</a>. If interested, please contact <a href="http://jonasoberg.net/about-me">Jonas</a> directly or janepark [at] creativecommons [dot] org. Though the course itself will be run in English, project proposals may be written and reviewed in English, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Russian and Bulgarian. More languages may be added depending on the final team of reviewers. </p>
