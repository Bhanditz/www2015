<p>As promised in last week's post on <em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12779">The Commons Video</a></em>, here's an interview with David Bollier, author of <em><a href="http://www.viralspiral.cc/">Viral Spiral: How the Commoners Built a Digital Republic of Their Own</a></em>, which we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12448">said in January</a> "will likely establish itself as a definitive guide for those seeking to understand and discover the key players and concepts in the digital commons. From the beginnings of the Free Software Movement, to Wikipediaâ€™s Inception, to Lessig founding Creative Commons at Harvard Law School, Bollier thoughtfully examines the principles and circumstances that helped nurture our digital commons from idea to (meta)physical reality."</p>
<p>Read on for an explanation of how Bollier became interested in digital commons movement, how he sees the its long term impact shaping up, and much in between.</p>
<p><strong>You've been involved in efforts  to understand and evangelize the broad concept of "the commons"  for a long time, including as an editor of <a href="http://onthecommons.org/">onthecommons.org</a>. What first  got you interested in the commons, and when was that?</strong></p>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s,  I worked for Ralph Nader and a number of Washington public-interest  advocacy groups.  Far from being the reviled figure that he became  following the 2000 election, Nader was revered among progressives for  his sophistication in politicizing and developing dozens of issues.    These were generally taboo or â€œboringâ€ topics that were utterly  off the national agenda â€“ topics that had not even crystallized as  â€œissues,â€ such as auto safety, clean air and clean water, open government  and congressional reform, not to mention countless niche issues like  mobile home safety, nutritional labeling and whistleblower protection.   (For more, see the DVD, â€œAn Unreasonable Man.â€)</p>
<p>I attended a 1980 conference  that Nader convened that affected me a great deal.  It was entitled,  â€œControlling What We Own,â€ and it dealt with the many resources  that the American people nominally or even legally own, but which we  do not control or reap benefits from.  Nader groups were involved  in most of these issues.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For example, commercial broadcasters  use the publicly owned airwaves for free, but give virtually nothing  in return for their use.  (Some token public-interest obligations  like the Fairness Doctrine were de-regulated into oblivion in the 1990s,  and the government requires no payments for use of the public spectrum.)   Mineral extraction from public lands is still governed by a law passed  during the administration of Ulysses S. Grant, in 1872, which grants  access rights for $5 an acre or less.  Grazing and logging on public  lands are usually allowed under leases with below-market fees.   Federally financed drug research is usually given away to drug companies  for a pittance.  Pharmaceutical companies then charge us exorbitant  prices for drugs that we, as taxpayers, financed in the first place.</p>
<p>In 2000, I was inspired to write  a book about these â€œenclosures of the commonsâ€ because they were  generally not recognized as a broader phenomenon.  The result was <em>Silent Theft:  The Private Plunder of Our Common Wealth</em>, which  was published in 2002. </p>
<p>Besides describing the many common  assets that are being stolen from us, the book developed an analysis  of the commons.  It drew somewhat upon the scholarship of pioneers  such as Elinor Ostrom, Yochai Benkler, Larry Lessig and others in the  nascent free culture movement.  I was excited about applying the  commons framework more broadly than academics did, and in more accessible,  popular ways.  Thatâ€™s because I see the commons paradigm as having  an enormous intellectual and political potential. </p>
<p>It is especially useful in confronting  the limitations of conventional economics and its parochial notions  of â€œvalue,â€ which focuses almost exclusively on prices in market  transactions.  The commons encompasses a far wider, qualitatively  different universe of â€œvalue.â€  It validates a more humanistic  and socially grounded matrix of value.  Yet it does so in an intellectually  coherent framework that has its own logic and principles; the commons  is not simply a moralistic rhetoric for â€œthe common good.â€ </p>
<p>The commons is about specific  types of social management and policy mechanisms.  And because  the commons has the capacity to manage shared resources effectively,  it implicitly challenges the conventional legal and economic premises  of copyright and other property-rights regimes.  It provokes a  new dialogue that has the potential to transform the existing policy  consensus.   Thatâ€™s exciting.</p>
<p><strong>How do you contextualize the  movement to create, curate, and protect an intellectual commons (of  which Creative Commons is a part) within the broad concept and history  of the commons?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Garrett Hardinâ€™s  famous 1968 essay in <em>Science</em> on the â€œtragedy of the commonsâ€  has cast a long shadow on the commons.  Mainstream economists and  conservative political groups seized upon the â€œtragedyâ€ paradigm.   They saw it as a way to promote the idea that only private property  rights can truly solve the problem of over-exploitation of a shared  resource.  They helped turn the â€œtragedy of the commons into  an economic truism that simply isnâ€™t really true.  (As he later  admitted, Hardin was discussing an open access regime, in which there  is no community and no rules, which of course is not a commons.)</p>
<p>With her 1990 book, <em>Governing  the Commons</em>, however, Indiana University political scientist Elinor  Ostrom marshaled many empirical examples of natural resources that have  been managed as commons for decades or even hundreds of years.   She identified some recurrent principles that seem to make a commons  work â€“ things like clearly defined boundaries around a resource; group  monitoring of usage of the resource; and graduated sanctions against  free riders or those who might abuse a resource. </p>
<p>Ostrom went on to found the Workshop  on Political Theory and Policy Analysis, the Digital Library on the  Commons, and the International Association for the Study of the Commons  (originally the term â€œCommon Propertyâ€ was used).  There are  now hundreds of academics around the world who study â€œcommon pool  resources,â€ mostly in the context of natural resources in developing  countries. </p>
<p>Starting in the 1980s and 1990s,  an entirely different group of academics â€“ mostly law scholars â€“  helped develop the idea of the intellectual commons.  Peter Jaszi,  David Lange, Pamela Samuelson, Jessica Litman, James Boyle, Yochai Benkler,  Larry Lessig and others took the public domain seriously.  A number  of notable activists such Mitch Kapor, John Perry Barlow, Fred von Lohmann  and Gigi Sohn also helped bring the problems of copyright law to public  attention. </p>
<p>As the Internet took off in the  1990s, and the film and record industries began to win major expansions  of copyright protection, these law scholars and activists helped re-conceptualize  the public domain.  They re-cast it as something worth protecting.   People started to realize that the public domain is necessary for new  types of creativity.  This challenged the orthodoxies of mainstream  copyright law and economics.  A major landmark in the evolution  of this idea was a November 2001 conference on the public domain organized  by Jamie Boyle at Duke Law School.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, â€œthe  commonsâ€ has come to take on larger valences of meaning that the term,  the â€œpublic domain,â€ cannot convey.  The public domain, after  all, is a specialized legal term with its own history.  The commons  helps emphasize that public-domain information is not simply â€œthe  opposite of propertyâ€ â€“ as copyright scholars long presumed â€“  but a different sort of value than conventional property.  The  commons is a means by which a social community generates value; it is  not something that derives solely from theâ€ originalityâ€ of an individual  acting alone. </p>
<p>Copyright law has trouble accepting  the idea of the commons as a vehicle of <em>socially created value</em>.   Thatâ€™s why the Creative Commons licenses are such a brilliant innovation.   They understand this idea and cleverly use copyright law to legally  recognize socially created value:  an enormous conceptual improvement  in copyright law achieved through an ingenious â€œhack.â€</p>

<p><strong>How did you come to write  a history of Creative Commons?  And how is that history a "viral  spiral"?</strong></p>
<p>After traveling in the worlds  of free software, copyright activism and the commons for nearly ten  years â€“ mostly as a policy activist â€“ I became acutely aware of  how much of this history was invisible to mainstream political culture. </p>
<p>Sure, many people had heard about  Linux and open source software, and perhaps even the Creative Commons  licenses.  But few laypeople really understood the enormous political  or cultural implications of these developments or how they arose.   Even many people within free software or open-access publishing, for  example, do not appreciate the full breadth of the free culture movement  or the significance of the commons paradigm.  There are few accessible,  big-picture histories of the movement as a whole. </p>
<p>Yet hereâ€™s the irony:   At a time when the Bush Administration in effect achieved a â€œlockdownâ€  of the political culture from 2001 to 2008 â€“ policy innovation was  brought to an utter standstill â€“ free culture was one of the few spaces  where idealism and innovation could run free.  People with creative,  brilliant ideas could actually produce serious, effective mechanisms  for change.  It has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise  moribund political culture. </p>
<p>Free culture has built its own  alternative democratic polity â€“ a parallel universe that honors such  radical ideas as participation, transparency and accountability.   Free culture has acted as a kind of counterpoint and rebuke to our corrupted  constitutional polity.</p>
<p>So I wanted to tell this story.   I wanted to explain â€œhow the commoners built a digital republic of  their own.â€  This idea seemed like a perfect complement to my  previous books.  <em>Silent Theft </em> explored the idea of the commons and its many enclosures, and <em>Brand  Name Bullies</em>, in 2005, told dozens of stories about how copyright  and trademark law are being used to privatize culture.  <em>Viral  Spiral </em>pulls together the eclectic threads of activism, scholarship,  technology and social innovation that have produced free culture over  the past generation.</p>
<p>I hit upon the term â€œviral  spiralâ€ as a way to explain the evolution of free culture.  <em> Viral</em> refers to the almost-magical ways in which new ideas and innovations  proliferate spontaneously on the Internet.  People without credentials  or money â€“ <em>commoners</em> â€“ can create their own citadels of shared  culture and information.  <em>Spiral</em> refers to the way in which  the innovations of one Internet cohort rapidly becomes the platform  used by later cohorts to build follow-on innovations.  Itâ€™s a  messy, non-linear, unpredictable, upward spiral of progress. </p>
<p>Richard Stallman and free software  began the viral spiral by pioneering the use of a copyright license  â€“ the General Public License -- to protect the commons.  Free  software demonstrated how a viral community could coalesce and generate  useful stuff (code), and a license could protect against private enclosure.</p>
<p>Creative Commons licenses built  on the example and experiences of free software, but with their own  new twists, such as individual choice in how a work may be shared.   The CC licenses now serve as a platform for countless new species innovations  on the content layer.  Some of the most notable examples are open  educational resources (OER), open science innovations, and open business  models.</p>
<p>For me, â€œviral spiralâ€ helps  point to the historical interconnectedness of this evolution of commons-based  innovation.  Itâ€™s a great story about how a motley assemblage  of self-selected activists, thinkers and volunteers built the technological  infrastructure, legal rules and social ethic for a new movement.   The movement is more than a bid for â€œcontrolling what we own,â€ however.   Itâ€™s a movement about democratic transformation and renewal â€“ a  story that is still unfolding. </p>
<p><strong>What parts of the book did  you find most fun and most frustrating to write?</strong></p>
<p>It was great fun interviewing  key figures in the free culture movement â€“ Larry Lessig, Richard Stallman,  Joi Ito, Ronaldo Lemos, Jamie Boyle and many others -- to ask questions  that had always perplexed me, and to figure out how the movement evolved  fitfully over time. </p>
<p>Learning more about the international  expansion of the CC licenses and free culture was really exciting.   It was exciting to learn that this movement is not just about law scholars  tweaking boring copyright licenses â€“ but about the rise of a new type  of international political culture.  The licenses have attracted  passionate musicians from Brazil, resourceful hackers from Amsterdam,  talented remix artists from Japan, educators from South Africa concerned  with open education and open access publishing, and so many other people.   Each of the iCommons conferences â€“ in Rio, Dubrovnik and Sapporo were  fantastic experiences that showed the deep global appeal â€“ and yet  the diverse manifestations â€“ of free culture. </p>
<p>The most difficult challenge  in writing <em>Viral Spiral </em>was identifying the overarching narrative.   There was such a dense, confusing mass of material, participants and  historical developments to sort through.  I had to immerse myself  in vast quantities of information, interviews, Web content and personal  experiences â€“ and somehow tease out an intelligible storyline.   If my book achieves anything, I hope it confirms that the rise of the  digital commons is truly one of the great stories of our time.</p>
<p><strong>The book's subtitle "How  the Commoners Built a Digital Republic of Their Own" is in past  tense, though your concluding chapter, which really covers this, "The  Digital Republic and The Future of Democratic Culture", is visionary  and (obviously) looking to the future.  To what extent have we  already built something that could be called a "digital republic"?</strong></p>
<p>Well, my preceding answers make  this clear:  a large and impressive â€œdigital republicâ€ is already  flourishing.  There are shared Internet protocols; thousands of  free software and open source software programs; Creative Commons licenses  that enable sharing and new creativity; countless varieties of online  commons from wikis to the blogosphere to social networking; new creative  genres like music remixes, video mashups and podcasting; and on and  on. </p>
<p>Whatâ€™s so great about this  messy viral spiral is that it is still evolving!  Yesterdayâ€™s  innovations are the platform for new ones tomorrow.  And while  the new commons sector is invigorating the commercial marketplace with  new creativity, this sector cannot be captured and taken private by  the marketplace.  Thatâ€™s a significant political achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Again in your concluding chapter,  you write of the commons as the backdrop for enabling "history-making  citizenship." Is this a more approachable form of Benkler's  lengthy "freedom to do more for oneself, by oneself, and with others"  and brief "autonomy" (<a href="http://yupnet.org/benkler/archives/15#2">http://yupnet.org/benkler/archives/15#2</a>),  or do you see this as a significantly different take  on what the commons enables?</strong></p>
<p>My sense of the commons as an  enabler of â€œhistory-making citizenshipâ€ is entirely compatible with  Benklerâ€™s vision in Chapter 5 of <em>The Wealth of Networks. </em> Indeed, I canâ€™t begin to calculate how influential Yochai has been  in my thinking, and he certainly explores this idea with great philosophical  precision.</p>
<p>That said, I have a different  emphasis than Yochai does.  He discusses the freedoms that a commons  enables as a contrast to those of the marketplace â€“ which is certainly  true and significant.  But I am fascinated with the ways in which  the commons constitutes a whole new layer of governance and offers new  types of collective-action possibilities in civil life.  Perhaps  this is what Benkler is saying as well, but I tried to place this theme  front-and-center, and place it in the history of citizenship itself.</p>
<p>Unlike previous eras of citizenship  that were constrained by oneâ€™s economic station or access to political  parties or the media, ordinary citizens now have some incredibly powerful  tools for â€œmaking history.â€   They can directly influence  politics, governance and civic life, and do not necessarily have to  work through surrogates like political parties or the press.  Citizens  can realistically instigate direct action themselves and have an impact  on politics, culture and the marketplace.  Any self-organized group  has the capacity to speak to a global audience, organize functionally  powerful collectives and influence official governance. </p>
<p>History-making citizenship is  still in a rudimentary stage.  But itâ€™s clear that citizen-led  collectives are calling into question the moral and social legitimacy  of existing institutions.  It is forcing new voices to be heard  and represented. </p>
<p>So long as the Internet remains  an open-access infrastructure, new commons will keep arising, and growing  stronger.  As they do, they will empower like-minded citizens to  challenge unresponsive institutions and remake the political culture  in their own image.  This is huge.  Developing a new rapprochement  between centralized institutions and decentralized commons will take  time, and be politically contentious and messy.  But I remain optimistic  that the viral spiral will be a potent force for improving democratic  culture in the years ahead.</p>
