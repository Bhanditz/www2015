<p><a href="http://faircopy.com">FAIRCOPY</a> has developed an innovative way for musicians to distribute their content over P2P networks and get paid.  They've also built in a way for <a href="http://www.faircopy.com/action/explain">fans to leverage the power of P2P to resdistribute</a> their favorite FAIRCOPY artists, and make a commission.  Musicians can also offer free samples of their work under Creative Commons licenses.</p>
