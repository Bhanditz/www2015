<p><a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/concept-series/">The Mozilla Concept Series</a> is a <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-the-concept-series-call-for-participation/">recently announced</a> initiative from <a href="http://mozilla.com/">Mozilla</a> to garner greater participation in creating their newest browser, <strong>Aurora</strong>. While there are some <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/aurora/">intriguing</a> <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1466664">inaugural</a> <a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/firefox-mobile-concept-video/">designs</a>, the most engaging part of the project is that Mozilla is pooling the greater web community for submissions in the form of ideas, mockups (textual/visual examples), and prototypes (interactive illustrations). Of note to the CC community is that Mozilla is requiring that all ideas and mockups are submitted under a CC license, making them easily "redistributable and remixable" (prototypes require an accompanying <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">Mozilla Public License</a>). From Mozilla:</p>
<blockquote><p>We only ask that all concepts and related source materials be freely redistributable and remixable under either a Creative Commons license (for Ideas and Mockups) or the Mozilla Public License (for Prototypes) so that we can all effectively collaborate on the exploration. Again, the intent is not for these concepts to evolve directly into new products but rather to provoke thought, facilitate discussion and provide inspiration.</p></blockquote>
