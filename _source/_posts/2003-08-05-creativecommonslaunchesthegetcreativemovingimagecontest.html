messaging"</p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, USA</strong> Creative Commons announced today the<br />
launch of the GET CREATIVE! Moving Image Contest. Entrants are invited to<br />
create a 2-minute presentation in the animation or moving image format of<br />
their choice that explains Creative Commons' mission.</p>
<p>"With 'Get Creative,' our own Flash movie, we took a shot at explaining<br />
Creative Commons," said Lawrence Lessig, chairman of Creative Commons and<br />
professor of law at Stanford. "We're fond of it, but we think the<br />
community that's grown around this idea could do an even better job. The<br />
Moving Image Contest will be an exercise in open-source messaging."</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley nonprofit will encourage entrants to re-use materials<br />
licensed under its free copyright licenses, including Creative Commons'<br />
own artwork, graphics, and Flash animation, as well as original and<br />
