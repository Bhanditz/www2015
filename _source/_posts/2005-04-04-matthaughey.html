<p>In the spirit of fuller liner notes and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5366">proper attribution</a>, I'd like to take a few minutes to point out a few things I am particularly grateful for -- specific accomplishments of specific Creative Commoners that may not have yet been attributed fully enough to them.</p>
<p>(I tried <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5165">to start doing this</a> a few months ago, but work pulled me back into the vortex.)</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#14">Matt Haughey</a> has been at Creative Commons since April 2002; we've worked together since the very beginning. Anyone who knows Matt's presence and prominence online knows that Creative Commons' early growth -- among bloggers, in particular -- would not have been the same without him. He's been the ideal liaison to social software developers and companies (like <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>), and less visibly and glamorously, the backbone to CC's own internal communications tech. He's also, on top of the regular and heavy stream of UI and information design work, done hundreds if not thousands of tight-deadlined designs, at all possible hours of the day, for things as different as CD covers (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/extras/copyremix">e.g.</a>) and Featured Commoner spreads (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/image/illegalart">e.g.</a>).</p>
<p>Matt has also, with DeMaggio-like consistency, pointed blog readers to some of the coolest Creative Commons content with his Featured Content of the Week posts (e.g.: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3985">1,</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3803">2,</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4275">3,</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4314">4,</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4184">5.</a>)</p>
<p>Matt took our website from looking like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020208092153/http://www.creativecommons.org/">this</a>, to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020913183859/http://www.creativecommons.org/">this</a>, to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030204065748/http://www.creativecommons.org/">this</a>, to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031118180321/http://creativecommons.org/">this</a>, to the site's stunning design today.</p>
<p>This speaks for itself.</p>
<p>And in case it doesn't, and in case I haven't said it expressly enough (which I probably haven't), thanks to Matt for all of this and more.</p></p>
