<p>At the <a href="http://programforthefuture.org">Program for the Future</a> conference, Creative Commons received the first Collective Intelligence Recognition Award for an organization. Tim O'Reilly received the first individual award. From the <a href="http://programforthefuture.org/press/programforthefutureawards.pdf">press release</a> (pdf):<br />
<blockquote>The awards were presented by renowned computer visionary and inventor Douglas Engelbart and Robert Stephenson, curator at The Tech Museum of Innovation. Said Engelbart: â€œAlong the digital frontier, we rely on our scouts to explore the terrain and exchange information at the trading posts. Tim Oâ€™Reilly has set up the â€˜Internet Pony Expressâ€™ to broadcast the possibilities of Open Source and Web 2.0 to the rest of the world. Creative Commons has begun the development of â€˜trading postâ€™ rules for us to collectively work together in developing and applying knowledge to solve complex urgent problems. On the 40th anniversary of The Demo, I am happy to recognize both for their demonstrated contributions to increasing our collective intelligence. Great stuff!</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a great honor for Creative Commons to be recognized by visionary Doug Engelbart and alongside Tim O'Reilly (a long time <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7134">supporter</a> of CC, from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3476">beginning</a>; please <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">join</a> him).</p>
<p>The conference celebrated the 40th anniversary of Engelbart's groundbreaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">demo</a>, with the broader theme of increasing collective intelligence -- Engelbart's life work -- for solutions to human problems. There was a broad sense among attendees that our collective memory is too short, but the future is hopeful if we <em>consciously</em> build tools to help us ("bootstrap tools" in the parlance), and that mass collaboration and building the commons have critical roles to play.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many of the conversations sparked by the conference had to do with learning. One poll of attendees found that those who had read Engelbart's papers were far more likely to believe that education could be radically changed for the better. Tim O'Reilly blogged a conversation on one important aspect of learning -- <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/hard-work-and-practice-in-programming.html">practice</a>.</p>
