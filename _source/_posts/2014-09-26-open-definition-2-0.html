<p>Today <a href="https://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge</a> and the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/advisory-council/">Open Definition Advisory Council</a> announced the release of version 2.0 of the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a>. The Definition â€œsets out principles that define openness in relation to data and content,â€ and is the baseline from which various public licenses are measured. Any content released under an <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">Open Definition-conformant license</a> means that anyone can â€œfreely access, use, modify, and share that content, for any purpose, subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness.â€ The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> 4.0 licenses are conformant with the Open Definition, as are all previous versions of these licenses (1.0 â€“ 3.0, including jurisdiction ports). The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a> is also aligned with the Open Definition.</p>
<p>The Open Definition is an important standard that communicates the fundamental legal conditions that make content and data open. One of the most notable updates to <a href="http://opendefinition.org/od/">version 2.0</a> is that it separates and clarifies the requirements under which an individual <b><i>work</i></b> will be considered open from the conditions under which a <b><i>license</i></b> will be considered conformant with the Definition.</p>
<p>Public sector bodies, GLAM institutions, and open data initiatives around the world are looking for recommendation and advice on the best licenses for their policies and projects. Itâ€™s helpful to be able to point policymakers and data publishers to a neutral, community-supported definition with a list of approved licenses for sharing content and data (and of course, we think that CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0 are some of the best, especially for <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/about/#principles">publicly funded materials</a>). And while we still see that some governments and other institutions are attempting to create their own custom licenses, hopefully the Open Definition 2.0 will help guide these groups into understanding of the benefits to using an existing OD-compliant license. The more that content and data providers use one of these licenses, the more theyâ€™ll add to a huge pool of legally reusable and interoperable content for anyone to use and repurpose.</p>
<p>To the extent that new licenses continue to be developed, the Open Definition Advisory Council has been honing a process to assist in evaluating whether licenses meet the Open Definition. Version 2.0 continues to urge potential license stewards to think carefully before attempting to develop their own license, and requires that they understand the common conditions and restrictions that should (or should not) be contained in a new license in order to promote interoperability with existing licenses.</p>
<p>Open Definition version 2.0 was <a href="https://github.com/okfn/opendefinition">collaboratively</a> and <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/od-discuss/">transparently</a> developed with input from experts involved in open access, open culture, open data, open education, open government, open source and wiki communities. Congratulations to Open Knowledge and the Open Definition Advisory Council on this important improvement.</p>
