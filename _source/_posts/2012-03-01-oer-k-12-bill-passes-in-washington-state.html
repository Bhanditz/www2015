<p>There was exciting open policy news from U.S. Washington State (WA) last evening.</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=2337&amp;year=2011">HB 2337</a> â€œRegarding open educational resources in K-12 educationâ€ passed the Senate (47 to 1) and is on its way back to the House for final concurrence. It already passed the House 88 to 7 before moving to the Senate.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/House Bills/2337-S2.E.pdf">bill</a> directs the Superintendent of Public Instruction (<a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/">OSPI</a>) to support the 295 WA K-12 school districts in learning about and adopting existing open educational resources (OER) aligned with WA and <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">common core</a> curricular standards (e.g., <a href="http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/">CK-12</a> textbooks &amp; <a href="http://www.curriki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/BrowseStandards">Curriki</a>). The bill also directs OSPI to <em>â€œprovide professional development programs that offer support, guidance, and instruction regarding the creation, use, and continuous improvement of open courseware.â€</em></p>
<p>The opening section of the bill reads:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>â€œThe legislature finds the state's recent adoption of common core K-12 standards provides an opportunity to develop high-quality, openly licensed K-12 courseware that is aligned with these standards. By developing this library of openly licensed courseware and making it available to school districts free of charge, the state and school districts will be able to provide students with curricula and texts while substantially reducing the expenses that districts would otherwise incur in purchasing these materials. In addition, this library of openly licensed courseware will provide districts and students with a broader selection of materials, and materials that are more up-to-date.â€</em></li>
</ul>
<p>While focus of this bill is to help school districts identify existing high-quality, free, openly licensed, common core state standards aligned resources available for local adoption; any content built with public funds, must be licensed under â€œan <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">attribution</a> license.â€</p>
<p>Representative <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/house/representatives/pages/carlyle.aspx">Reuven Carlyle</a> has been a leader working on open education (including the <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org/">Open Course Library</a>) in WA for years and has blogged about it: <a href="http://reuvencarlyle36.com/2012/01/29/bills-to-end-the-reign-of-expensive-proprietary-out-of-date-textbooks/">here</a>, <a href="http://reuvencarlyle36.com/2011/12/26/radical-openness-in-educational-materials-the-next-step-in-washington/">here</a>, <a href="http://reuvencarlyle36.com/2011/10/31/beginning-of-the-end-for-100-college-textbooks-legislature-colleges-gates-foundation-partner/">here</a> and <a href="http://reuvencarlyle36.com/2010/07/09/watch-750k-turn-into-41-million-washington-attacks-college-textbook-costs/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Representative Carlyle introducing HB2337 in the House:</p>

<p>Creative Commonsâ€™ Director of Global Learning, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27223">Cable Green</a>, testifying about the impact of the bill on elementary education in the Senate:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tvw.org/scripts/iframe_video.php?eventID=2012021089&amp;amp;start=1296&amp;amp;stop=1897"><iframe src="http://www.tvw.org/scripts/iframe_video.php?eventID=2012021089&amp;start=1296&amp;stop=1897" width="550" height="320"></iframe></a></p>
<p>WA is poised to follow the good work of <a href="http://utahopentextbooks.org/2012/01/25/114/">Utah</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27698">Brazil</a>, and so many others who have gone before.</p>
<p>This legislature has declared that the status quo -- $130M / year for expensive, paper-only textbooks that are, on average, 7-11 years out of date -- is unacceptable. WA policy makers instead decided their 1 million+ elementary students deserve better and they have acted.</p>
<p>Congratulations Washington State!</p>
