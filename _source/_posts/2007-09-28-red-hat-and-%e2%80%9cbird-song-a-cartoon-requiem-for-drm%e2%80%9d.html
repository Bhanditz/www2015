<p>A bit late (exactly a month in fact), but in case you missed it the first time as well, Red Hat posted an amazing short about DRM titled <a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/08/24/birdsong-a-requiem-for-drm/">"Bird Song: A Cartoon Requiem for DRM"</a>. Its a beautifully made animation and Red Hat has gone the distance in <a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/08/28/bird-song-mash-up-challenge-here-are-the-elements/">licensing the different elements</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-SA licence</a>.</p>
<p>By utilizing CC-licences, Red Hat extend "an open invitation to use, share and modify as you wish, as long as you share your production, donâ€™t use it for commercial purposes and give us (and those before you) a nod of recognition for getting it started". So, as always, get your redistribute/remix/share on, and maybe your bird can sing.</p>
