<p>Some sharp guys over at <a href="http://www.cogniview.com/">Cogniview</a> emailed me a couple of weeks ago, inquiring about embedding CC licenses in PDF files.  Today I got a chance to look at the first fruits of that interchange, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCInfo_for_Acrobat">CCInfo</a>.  CCInfo is a plugin for Adobe Acrobat that lets you select and embed a Creative Commons license.  Its Windows only right now, so if you're a Mac developer or have graphic design skills, they'd like some help.  Check out the <a href="http://www.cogniview.com/creative-commons-info.php">download page</a> for contact details.</p>
