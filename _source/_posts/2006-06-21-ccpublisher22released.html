<p>In preparation for the <a href="http://icommons.org">iCommons iSummit</a> taking place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil later this week, we're pleased to announce that ccPublisher 2.2 is now available.  The focus of this release was internationalization, and it includes translations for Chinese (Taiwan), Croation, Dutch, Polish, and Spanish.  Thanks to the volunteers who graciously handled the translation efforts.  In addition to translation support, ccPublisher 2.2 corrects many bugs which our users reported using the automated crash reporter.</p>
<p>Download links for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X are available <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher">here</a>.  Those interested in helping to translate ccPublisher into their own language can find details on the process <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Translating_ccPublisher">in the wiki</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update (23 June 2006):</strong> After discovering a bug we missed in 2.2, we've released the first bug-fix release -- 2.2.1; details at the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher_2_2">release page</a>.</p>
