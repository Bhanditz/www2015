<p>Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/08/controlling-copies-i.html">points us to a great post</a> by EFF's International Outreach Coordinator <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/danny-obrien">Danny O'Brien</a> (<strong>NOTE</strong>: O'Brien didn't write the article on behalf of EFF, rather on his own time on a personal blog)  on the <a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/wp/2008/08/07/copyright-fraud-and-window-taxes-no-not-that-windows/">cultural difference between 'attribution' and 'copying' on the Internet</a>. O'Brien makes the astute point that while copying is relatively uncontroversial to most web-users, lack of proper attribution is widely considered web-sacrilege. Doctorow accurately relates O'Brien's argument to our original CC-licences, which had the ability for users to pass over the Attribution clause. We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216">did away with that choice in version 2.0</a>, as 97%-98% of users were choosing to use licenses that included our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">BY</a> clause. From O'Brien's piece "<a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/wp/2008/08/07/copyright-fraud-and-window-taxes-no-not-that-windows/">Copyright, Fraud and Window Taxes (No, not that Windows)</a>":</p>
<blockquote><p>In a digital world, many people don't see the act of copying as a particularly momentous or profitable event. Copying isn't what we do as an act of purchasing; copying is a thing we do to our valuable artifacts. People are scandalised when its suggested that you should pay for a copy copied to backup drives, or iPods; they're amazed when vested interests demand that cached copies or transitory files should count as extra purchases. Copying is no longer a good proxy for incoming revenue; which means it is no longer a good place to extract remuneration [...] <strong>Nowadays, copying isn't always the core part of remunerative creative business. But accurate accreditation very much is</strong>. </p></blockquote>
<p>Of course we have our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">Public Domain Declaration</a> for anyone who wishes to give a work directly to the commons without wanting attribution. This aside, O'Brien's piece is a salient observation on the cultural language of the web - as the CC community has shown, many are ready to give their content away more freely but not without the cultural currency of proper accreditation. For more reading, head to the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/08/controlling-copies-i.html#comment-255959">comments section at the BB post</a> for a good discussion of how O'Brien's argument functions in regards to proper attribution and '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights">moral rights</a>'.</p>
