<p>When you select a license using the Creative Commons license engine, we return a block of HTML you can place on your web page to mark that you've licensed your content.  Included in that block of HTML is embedded metadata that programs can detect in order to determine which license you have selected.  We've had an extension for Mozilla-based browsers, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/MozCC">MozCC</a>, for quite some time.  Thanks to the work of an intrepid developer, Jaime Frutos Morales, we now have similar support for <a href="http://gnome.org/projects/epiphany">Epiphany</a>, a web browser for the <a href="http://gnome.org">Gnome</a> desktop environment.  You can find download details and installation instructions <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Epiphany_CC_Extension">in the wiki</a>.  Thanks, Jaime!</p>
