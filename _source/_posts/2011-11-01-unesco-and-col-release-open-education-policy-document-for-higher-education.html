<p><span style="float:right;padding:10px;" <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/unesco-col-cover.png"><img src="img/unesco-col-cover.png" alt="" title="unesco col cover" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-30183" /></p>
<p>Today UNESCO and the Commonwealth of Learning jointly released the policy document <a href="http://www.col.org/PublicationDocuments/Guidelines_OER_HE.pdf"><em>Guidelines for Open Educational Resources (OER) in Higher Education</em></a>. The purpose of the guidelines is "to encourage decision makers in governments and institutions to invest in the systematic production, adaptation, and use of OER and to bring them in to the mainstream of higher education in order to improve the quality of curricula and teaching and to reduce costs."</p>
<p>UNESCO and COL <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/all-news/news/unescocommonwealth_of_learning_oer_policy_guidelines_to_be_launched_at_the_unesco_general_conference/">note</a>, "Open Educational Resources are teaching, learning or research materials that are in the public domain and released with an open license (such as Creative Commons). They allow communities of practitioners and stakeholders to copy, adapt and share their resources legally and freely, in order to support high-quality and locally relevant teaching and learning."</p>
<p>The guidelines indicate how the potential of OER can be harnessed to support quality teaching and learning by higher education stakeholders, including governments, higher education institutions, teaching staff, students, and quality assurance, accreditation, and academic recognition authorities.</p>
<p>The <em>Guidelines for OER in Higher Education</em> inform the process leading up to the 2012 World OER Congress. That event is being organized by UNESCO and the Commonwealth of Learning, with support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. The Congress will 1) work to promote the UNESCO/COL OER Policy Guidelines; 2) share the worldâ€™s best practices in OER policies, initiatives, and experts; and 3) release the 2012 Paris OER Declaration calling on Governments to support the development and use of OERs.</p>
