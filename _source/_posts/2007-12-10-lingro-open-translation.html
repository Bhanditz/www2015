<p><a href="http://lingro.com/">Lingro</a>, a project <a href="http://lingro.com/docs/about.html">that aims</a> "to create an on-line environment that allows anyone learning a language to quickly look up and learn the vocabulary most important to them", is beginning to look seriously cool. Give it a web page in any language, and it spits the same page back at you with the ability to cross-reference word translations on the fly (see <a href="http://lingro.com/translate/english-spanish/creativecommons.org">an example of our site with a English-Spanish translation</a>). </p>
<p>Lingro pools the open-content community (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikitionary</a> and <a href="http://shtooka.net/project/en/">The Shtooka Project</a> to name two prominent sources), as well as user-contributed CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">BY-SA licensed</a> definitions, in order to gather a translation repository that is rich in both breadth and depth. By utilizing open-content <em>and</em> allowing a means to contribute open-content back to the community, Lingro fosters a vibrant cycle of information sharing, creating a resource that has immense potential in terms of education and cross-cultural communication.</p>
