<p>Audio fingerprinting (and more) company MusicIP has added the ability to attach a Creative Commons license to audio tracks <a href="http://www.musicip.com/artist/listenerlink">registered via their ListenerLink service</a> (<a href="http://www.musicip.com/themes/predixis/downloads/Press/Creative_Commons_Release-FINAL.pdf">press release</a>; PDF).</p>
<p>Community music metadatabase MusicBrainz is working with MusicIP's fingerprinting technology and has also added the ability to track CC licenses, see <a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/03/new_fingerprint.html">details on the MusicBrainz blog</a>.</p>
<p>This will be a good year for "open music infrastructure" and CC will be a big part of that...</p>
