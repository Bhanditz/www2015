<p>That's right! Students, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#intern">get your applications in before the end of the day on March 1</a> (which means PST for us in San Francisco reviewing applications).</p>
<p>As we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7215">announced before</a>, we are picking one intern to help our tech team and another to help us with creating media and building up our community. If you want to spend the summer building the commons, living in San Francisco, and generally plugging into one of the most dynamic social networks offline in SF and on-line on the web, then <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#intern">please apply</a>.</p>
<p>For both internships, there are several projects to work on. A good place to look is at our <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org">Labs demo/test site</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges">Developer Challenges</a> to get your heart beating faster. Then, for Media+Community internships, there will be some great work on some media-based (part-technical) projects like <a href="http://laptop.org">OLPC</a> and <a href="http://freeculture.org">FreeCulture.org</a>.</p>
