<p><img src="img/cc-six.png" alt="" title="CC Birthday " width="215" height="255" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11041" />To celebrate six exceptional years for CC and the December 31st wrap-up of our <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">2008 fundraising campaign</a>, CC headquarters is hosting a birthday bash in San Francisco! The San Francisco party joins the ranks of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2008">other global birthday parties</a> in Berlin, Brisbane, Guatemala, Seoul, and New York. The San Francisco event will be held on Thursday, December 18th, 2008, from 9pm - 2am at <a href="http://111minnagallery.com">111 Minna Gallery<a> (</a><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=firefox-a&q=111+minna+gallery&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=A">Map and Directions</a>).</p>
<p>We're thrilled to announce that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8998">Into Infinity</a>, the remixable art and music exhibition produced by <a href="http://dublab.com/">dublab</a> and Creative Commons, will make one of its first "real world" appearances as a physical installation at the party. Digital renderings of the show's visual works will be run through a software program that melds random pieces together to create new combinations. The resulting feed will be delivered to a projector and displayed against a wall to provide ever-changing visual stimuli to our partygoers. Additionally, there will be a live performance by several dublab producers and DJs, who will use Into Infinity's sound loops as the basis for an improvisational electronic music show.</p>
<p>And, of course, there will be dancing! Music will be provided by DJs Ripley and Kid Kameleon, both regulars at <a href="http://suryadub.com/">Surya Dub</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Tickets will be sold at the door, but please RSVP to rsvp[at]creativecommons.org so we know you're coming.<br />
From 9-11pm: $15 for <a href="http://creativecommons.net">CC Network</a> members and $20 for non-members. Hosted bar: beer, wine, and well-drinks (cash bar otherwise). <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">Join the CC Network today</a> to secure your discount!<br />
After 11pm: $5 for CC Network members and $10 for non-members. Cash bar.</p>
<p>We hope you'll join us for a fun and festive night of celebrating free culture and the future of Creative Commons! Everyone is welcome, but space is limited - so bring friends and arrive early!</p>
<p><strong> Can't make it to San Francisco or one of the other birthday party locales? </strong> No problem! We're encouraging members of our community around the world to come up with fun and creative ways to celebrate CC's six years: be part of the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/stories">CC Video Project</a> and make a 90-second video about why you love CC, screen a CC-licensed film, host a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon#Resources_for_starting_your_own_CC_Salon">Salon</a>, make a CC re-mix, design a birthday card or poster, or consider CC's birthday an excellent occasion to eat cake! This is a time to celebrate participatory culture, creativity, and innovation - and whatever you decide to do, make sure to document it and share it with us and the world by uploading your pictures or video to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> and tagging them "CC6." Head over to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party_2008">Birthday Party 2008 wiki page</a> for details on the planned parties and find out how to add your own!</a></p>
