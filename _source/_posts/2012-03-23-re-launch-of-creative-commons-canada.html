<p>Today weâ€™re pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.athabascau.ca/">Athabasca University</a>, <a href="http://www.bccampus.ca/">BCcampus</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cippic.ca/">Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic</a> have joined together to re-establish a CC affiliate team in Canada. All three organizations will take part in the official relaunch at the <a href="http://www.opendatasalon.ca">Creative Commons Salon Ottawa: Open Data</a> on Friday, March 30. </p>
<p>This is not a new affiliate so much as a re-ignition of our existing Canadian community. Since 2004, a number of volunteers, interns and affiliate leads have supported and promoted CC and the use of open licenses generally in a Canadian context. This new team, representing three organizations spread across the geographic and cultural expanse of Canada, will be a key asset to support and lead the CC activities of this community.</p>
<p>Through public outreach, community building, tools, research, and resources this team will work with a network of open supporters to maximize digital creativity, sharing and innovation across Canada. The work of CC Canada is aligned with the overarching vision of Creative Commons -- to help provide universal access to research and education, and full participation in culture to drive a new era of development, growth and productivity.</p>
<p>Whether you're an artist, teacher, scientist, librarian, policymaker or just a regular citizen, Creative Commons provides you with a free, public, and standardized set of tools and licenses that create a balance between the reality of the Internet and the reality of copyright laws. CC Canada joins over four hundred other affiliates working in seventy-two jurisdictions around the world in supporting the use of Creative Commons infrastructure. Collectively this global network is creating a vast and growing digital commons of content that can be copied, distributed, edited, remixed, and built upon, all within the boundaries of copyright law.</p>
