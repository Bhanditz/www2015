<p><a href="http://machinista.org">Machinista</a>, an arts festival focusing on machine-related art, will use Creative Commons licenses for the DVD containing the winning entries.  The winners will be chosen out of the 280 submissions, which are themed as "the world as seen by the machines."  Since the content will be CC-licensed, we're also hoping to have it hosted at the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> so the world can download it for free -- by using your own machine, of course.</p>
