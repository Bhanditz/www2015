<p>We are thrilled to announce the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011">2011 Creative Commons Global Summit</a>, now open for <a href="https://creativecommons.net/civicrm/event/info?id=7&amp;reset=1">registration</a>!</p>
<p>The Creative Commons Global Summit will take place over three full days from September 16-18 in Warsaw, Poland, and is generously hosted by our affiliates at CC Poland.</p>
<p>The theme of this year's Summit is "<em>Powering an Open Future</em>." As Creative Commons enters its second decade, prominent thinkers from the commons movement worldwide, including Sir John Daniels from the Commonwealth of Learning, Melissa Hagemann from the Open Society Foundations, CC board member Lawrence Lessig, and CC CEO Cathy Casserly, will come together with experts from our global <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">Affiliate Network</a>, CC <a href="/about/people">staff</a>, and key stakeholders to consider "what next"?</p>
<p>Central to the Summit will be a day-long CC Festival on Saturday, September 17th. This public day will feature a variety of panels, workshops, plenary speakers and a CC visual arts exhibition, showcasing the best of the commons now and in the future. It will include sessions focused on key areas of interest to the commons community worldwide, including education, science, government, data, business and the GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) sector. Most excitingly, it will be followed in the evening by a CC Salon, a musical celebration of creativity, remix, and openness.</p>
<p>The Global Summit will also serve as a major meeting and planning forum for the CC community itself, with regional meetings, legal debates, community planning, training workshops, and general discussion and strategizing on the big issues for the next ten years of CC, including the new version 4.0 licenses and supporting and enhancing the Affiliate Network worldwide. The <a href="/about/people/board">CC Board of Directors</a> will be joining us at the Summit, specifically to meet with the community and engage in these broader discussions.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons Global Summit will be a chance for the whole commons community to communicate, celebrate and connect. We hope you can join us.</p>
