<p>Keep an eye out for Creative Commons at the <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">South By Southwest Music and Media Conference</a> this March in Austin, Texas.  We'll be hosting two panels, announcing two projects that encourage collaboration and distribution of music and film.  Details coming soon.</p>
