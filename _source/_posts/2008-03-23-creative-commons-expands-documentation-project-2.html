<p>We're always trying to make Creative Commons licenses easier to understand and use. From the get-go, human-readable copyright licenses have been a CC mainstay. Creative Commons is excited to announce the expansion of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/documentation" title="Documentation project">documentation project</a> that explains various facets of Creative Commons licensing. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The initiative includes links and PDF downloads to information on critical CC specifications, recommendations, research studies and tutorials. Some of the topics covered include the CC+ and CC0 projects, a simple licensing how-to, and best practices for integrating Creative Commons licensing in websites. The documentation project also offers posters, flyers and other creative media such as the "Sharing Creative Works" comic book.</p></blockquote>
<p>We encourage the CC community to use the information provided, translate these documents into other languages, and help create new documentation too!</p>
