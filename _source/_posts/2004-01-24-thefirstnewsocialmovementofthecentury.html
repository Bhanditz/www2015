<p>The New York Times Magazine mentions Creative Commons in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/magazine/25COPYRIGHT.html">a long piece</a> about copyright reform this week. The article seems to be aimed at a general overview of the movement and <a href="http://www.copyfight.org/20040101.shtml#67390">forgets a few key details</a>, like <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a> being the man behind <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html#WhatIsCopyleft">Copyleft</a>.</p>
