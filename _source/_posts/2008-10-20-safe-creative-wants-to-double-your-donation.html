<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10001">Last Wednesday we launched</a> the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">2008 fundraising campaign</a>, with the goal of raising $500,000 by the end of the year. I know -- times are hard and that's a lot of money. So, in order to give you more "bang for your buck," so to speak, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.safecreative.org/home.shtml?cid=33934">Safe Creative</a> to give you a way to double the value of your contribution. For the next 2 weeks, Safe Creative will be matching every donation dollar for dollar -- up to $4000.</p>
<p>Safe Creative is a very cool project working to build a global intellectual property registry for creators to use (for free) to accredit the rights of their work. When you register your work with Safe Creative, you are given the option to CC license your work. So, if you want to register your work, which helps protect you as the creator, check them out. For more information (besides their website) check out the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/8/8f/SafeCreative_at_CC_Summit.pdf">presentation that they gave</a> at CC's inaugural Tech Summit. We couldn't be more excited to have them participate in this campaign -- continuing to show the world their support for Creative Commons and for a global sharing culture. Show your support too by <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">giving today</a>!</p>
