<p>We're excited to announce that Esther Wojcicki, current Chair of the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board">board</a>, esteemed and award-winning teacher, and leader at the nexus of education and technology, will become CC's Vice Chair focused on learning and education. CC's current CEO, Joi Ito, will step into the role of both Chair and CEO.</p>
<p>"Creative Commons continues to make tremendous strides in enabling openness and innovation in learning," Wojcicki said. "I'm very happy to focus my experience and expertise on ensuring that high-quality educational materials are made easily and freely available to everyone in the world."</p>
<p>Creative Commons benefits from a diverse board comprised of thought leaders, education experts, technologists, legal scholars, investors, entrepreneurs and philanthropists, all sharing a keen interest in improving quality and access in the learning sector. As a result, we anticipate that CC will be able to assist innovators, educators and policy makers in sharing the yet untapped potential of this revolution.</p>
