Earlier this year, officials from the US Defense Intelligence Agency came up with the idea of producing decks of cards for US troops that identified Iraq fugitives. Playing cards have <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/12/Worldandnation/Troops_dealt_an_old_t.shtml">a long history in war</a>, being part of both World War II and the Vietnam conflict.  The Department of Defense released the cards as public domain and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=iraq+most+wanted+playing+cards">a cottage industry of card producers</a> sprang up overight to sell them online.</p>

Unfortunately, DOD officials didn't realize the two joker cards carried the Hoyle Joker, a copyrighted image from US Playing Cards, the company behind Hoyle, Bicycle, and other popular brands of cards. As a result <a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/2643.html">US Playing Cards has begun sending cease-and-desist letters</a> to companies producing copycat cards, and the DIA is helping spread the word. US Playing Cards are currently selling <a href="http://www.usplayingcard.com/iraqdeck.html">their decks</a> as the one true official set.</p>

When dedicating something to the public domain, it's important to clear the rights to everything contained within a work, which can sometimes be difficult for film and works of collage. We try to stress this point in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/publicdomain">Public Domain Dedication process</a>, but with stories like the Hoyle Joker it's worth mentioning how important it is to make sure that you control the copyright on <em>every</em> part of your work before dedicating it to the Public Domain.
