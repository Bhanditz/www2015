<p><a href="http://www.kith-kin.co.uk/shop/">SomeRightsReserved</a> is a download-only design firm that produces "blueprints to a range of different products and objects", connecting "designer straight to consumer, empowering all parties." SRR uses different CC licences on different products, enabling customers to take the ideas therein and use them in a variety of different ways. From <a href="http://www.kith-kin.co.uk/shop/about/">SSR</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine being able to buy the digital blueprints to any object, being able to take it to a skilled professional and have it produced directly. Imagine instant access to quality design ideas and the means to manufacture products on demand. Imagine completely removing the middleman.</p>
<p>Some Rights Reserved lets designers get ideas out directly to the public, on their terms. Designers have greater creative freedom, flexibility, spontaneity, and control over licensing. Consumers are given the chance to purchase design instantly, either printing it out on their own printer or taking the file to a listed supplier for production. </p></blockquote>
<p>SSR has some <a href="http://www.kith-kin.co.uk/shop/products/">absolutely amazing projects</a>, some for sale and some for free - be sure to explore what they have available.</p>
