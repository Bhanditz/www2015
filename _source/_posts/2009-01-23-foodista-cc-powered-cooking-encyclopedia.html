<p><img src="img/foodista.jpg" alt="foodista" width="300" height="73" style="float:right;padding:10px" /><a href="http://www.foodista.com/">Foodista</a> is a new online destination for those interested in all things culinary-related. The site is divided into four sections - recipes, foods, tools and techniques - and is based around the idea that community knowledge and sharing can result in a better resource than one built by a restricted and closed group. As such, the folks behind Foodista <a href="http://www.foodista.com/about">have</a> "developed a system to let everyone edit content to make it better rather than have multiple versions of the same recipe." At its core, this system is based around a site-wide <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY license</a>.</p>
<p>By using our most permissive license, Foodista has laid the ground work for a site that is purely focused on collaboration and the growth of knowledge. A few months ago <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10948">we posted</a> about <a href="http://thefoodgeek.com/miscellaneous/who-owns-that-recipe">an article</a> that articulates why using a CC BY license for recipes is a sound choice (recipes canâ€™t be copyrighted while the expression of recipes can). It is a mindset Foodista has embraced and while the site is still in a nascent stage it is already showing <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Foodistacom-Launches-Enlists-Food-Bloggers/story.aspx?guid={14D8A339-624C-4E9F-BF0B-4F3A4937FB64}">great</a> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/brierdudley/2008533276_brier18.html">promise</a>. Part of the fun about cooking is the inherent experimentation and reiterations recipes can go through. Being able to document that sort of exchange through the use of open tools is a welcomed resource.</p>
