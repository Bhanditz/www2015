<a href="http://openvideoconference.org/">The Open Video Conference</a> is a two-day gathering of thought leaders in technology, business, public policy, art, and activism from around the world to explore the future of the moving image. The conference is happening at NYU Law School on June 19th and 20th and will feature keynotes from <a href="http://enwp.org/Clay_Shirky">Clay Shirky</a>, <a href="http://enwp.org/Yochai Benkler">Yochai Benkler</a> and <a href="http://enwp.org/Jon Lech Johansen">Jon Lech Johansen</a>. You can <a href="http://openvideoconference.org/agenda/">read more about the panels and workshops on the schedule</a>. </p>
<p>I'll be there representing CC (so ask me for some schwag if you see me) but many other important organizations will be in attendance as well, so it will be a great opportunity to put many names to faces.</p>
