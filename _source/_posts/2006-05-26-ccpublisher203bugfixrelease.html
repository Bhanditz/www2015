<p>Last week we shipped ccPublisher 2 and as with all major updates, there were bound to be bugs.  Fortunately users have been allowing the automated crash reporter to send (non-personal, non-identifying) information to the <a href="http://roundup.creativecommons.org/ccpublisher">ccPublisher Issue Tracker</a>, which has allowed us to work on fixing bugs people are encountering.  I've just uploaded ccPublisher 2.0.3.  This release fixes a handful of bugs which were reported several times by users.  It will be of particular interest to users who experienced crashes when using international characters in the metadata fields.  I encourage all users to download and install the upgrade.</p>
<p>Download information and a list of bugs fixed is available on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher_2">the release page</a>.</p>
