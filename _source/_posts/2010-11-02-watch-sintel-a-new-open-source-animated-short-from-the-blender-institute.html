<p>Last week, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24149">interviewed</a> Ton Roosendaal, head of the Blender Institute, on his new open animated short film called <em>Sintel</em>. (<a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is an awesome open-source 3D creation suite, and the Institute is the studio that creates content like <em>Sintel</em> that employ amazing Blender-enabled techniques like smoke simulation and volumetrics.)</p>
<p>The film was made possible with crowdsourced funding from thousands of online supporters and, since it was released on YouTube a month ago, has gotten over 1.8 million views. If you haven't seen it already, here's your chance!</p>
