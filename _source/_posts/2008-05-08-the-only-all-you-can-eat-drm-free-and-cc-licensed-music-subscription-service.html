<p><a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a>, the online record label that has been <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8237">pioneering open business practice</a>s for years, has now <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2008/05/magnatune-membe.html">launched a subscription service</a>.  Read the announcement for lots of interesting information about the service and the business.</p>
<p>In other Magnatune news, there's now a <a href="http://addons.songbirdnest.com/extensions/detail/226">Magnatune plugin for Songbird</a>, a nice addition to those for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8256">Amarok and Rhythmbox</a>.
