<p>Many of you know Mike Linksvayer, the first CTO and then Vice President of Creative Commons. Mike started at Creative Commons back in 2003 (almost a decade ago!), and since then has shepherded CC through a period of great expansion, providing leadership and support for efforts across various initiatives and around the world. He has also been a great help to all of us this past year, during the transition from part-time to full-time CEO. We can not begin to name everything that Mike has done, not only for Creative Commons, but for free and open culture generally, so we'll just name a few, with the caveat that, if ever there was a jack of all trades, he is Mike Linksvayer. </p>
<p>Since 2003, Mike has helped to:</p>
<ul>
<li>forward RDFa to a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-rdfa-syntax-20081014/">W3C Recommendation</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411">migrate Wikipedia to BY-SA</a>,</li>
<li>build scalable tools and processes to support <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Translate">translation</a> and localization,</li>
<li>deploy constituent management tools to support <a href="https://creativecommons.net/">fundraising and development</a>,</li>
<li>provide a great place for technical <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/summer-interns">interns</a> to come and develop their skills,</li>
<li>improve scalability and responsiveness of the CC website,</li>
<li>build <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">visionary legal tools</a> that enhance access to and grow our valuable public domain</li>
<li>test, test and re-test <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/">new ideas and experimental projects</a>, </li>
<li>support the continued development and well-being of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff">staff</a>, </li>
<li>develop our global network, providing guidance, support and encouragement for our affiliates worldwide,</li>
<li>bridge communities including F/LOSS and Wikimedia, and</li>
<li>implement compliant, employee-friendly operations and procedures to scale with staff size and program complexity, and</li>
<li>bring exaggerated skepticism, rigorous logic and thorough analysis to all of CC's program activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the board and staff would like to acknowledge that Mike has served as the primary voice of reason and forward thinking that has kept Creative Commons on a track that balances idealism with resource realism. We are grateful for Mike Linksvayerâ€™s exceptional role in building the Creative Commons organization. </p>
<p>His contributions to CC make it all the more difficult to announce Mike's transition from Vice President to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#ml">Senior Fellow</a> at Creative Commons.  In his new role, he will continue to advise on CC-related <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/welfare">research</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges">tech projects</a>, in addition to overarching <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Strategy">strategy</a>.  We fully expect Mike will continue to bring passion and opinion and reason to all of our work in his new role.</p>
<p>Please join us in thanking Mike for all of his hard work! Mike, we wish you the very best in your future endeavors. </p>
