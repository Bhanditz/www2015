<p><a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2010/03/new-business-model-for-magnatune.html"><img style="float: right; padding: 10px; border: none;" src="img/logo.gif" alt="" /></a>We've been <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3841">following Magnatune since it launched in 2003</a> as a record label that embraced the net, including giving fans the legal right to do what comes naturally given the net -- share an remix music noncommercially -- by offering all label music under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. At the time a fairly radical position. Fast forward nearly 7 years to Magnatune founder John Buckman's <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2010/03/new-business-model-for-magnatune.html">update on the label's business</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So really, it's not so much that we're changing business models, but rather that we introduced "unlimited memberships" two years ago, and they've been so successful we're deciding to focus on that.</p>
<p>Some things that are not changing:</p>
<ul>
<li> We're still not evil: we have always paid 50% of membership fees to our musicians, been DRM free, and used Creative Commons licensing. All that stays the same.</li>
<li>We will continue selling commercial use licenses of our music, though in a few months we will be moving that business to a new music-licensing web site we're building (iLicenseMusic.com).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm personally really excited with the change, because 4 years ago I noticed that our download sales were declining, and it wasn't until 2 years ago that I finally figured out what people wanted. Magnatune has been going since 2003, and the future looks rosy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also see John's immediately previous post with an <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2010/03/magnatune-sends-check-to-gnome-foundation-thanks-to-rhythmbox.html">update on the label's work with and support of free software media players</a>, which we first <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8256">noted here in 2008</a>.</p>
<p>We applaud Magnatune's long-term commitment to CC licenses and their willingness to constantly innovate based on fan and customer feedback rather than the unfortunate standard practice -- treat fans poorly and hope they continue as customers anyway. Recall Mike Masnick's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12695">Connect With Fans (CwF) + Reason To Buy (RtB) = The  Business Model ($$$$)</a> formula for a general treatment.</p>
