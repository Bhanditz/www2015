<p><a href="http://www.openendedgroup.com/index.php/in-progress/loops-open-source/"><em>Loops</em></a> is an amazing new project, created collaboratively between the <a href="http://merce.org/">Merce Cunningham Dance Company</a> and <a href="http://www.openendedgroup.com/">The OpenEnded Group</a>, to release <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merce_Cunningham">Merce Cunninghamâ€™s</a> choreography for his solo dance <em>Loops</em> under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA license</a>.</p>
<p>By releasing <em>Loops</em> under a CC-license, anyone is able to perform, reproduce, and adapt it for non-commercial purposes. Simultaneously, the digital artists of The OpenEnded Group (Marc Downie, Shelley Eshkar, and Paul Kaiser) will release a digital portrait of Cunningham, also entitled <em>Loops</em>, as open source software. This artwork derives from a high-resolution 3D recording of Cunningham performing the solo with his hands and promises to provide ample substance for derivative works.</p>
<p>The public release of the <em>Loops</em> project will take place this Tuesday, February 26 at 6:30 PM in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=55+Bethune+Street+New+York,+NY+10014&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1">Merce Cunningham Studio</a>. The event is co-hosted by the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/lpa.html">New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center</a> and will include a presentation of the choreography and digital artwork, remarks from Merce Cunningham as well as Paul Kaiser and Marc Downie of The OpenEnded Group, and a reception. The choreography and code will be released simultaneously online the same day.</p>
