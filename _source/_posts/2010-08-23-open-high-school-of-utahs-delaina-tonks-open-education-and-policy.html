<p>At the beginning of this year weÂ <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20329">announced a revised approach</a> to our education plans, focusing our activities to support of the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement. In order to do so we have worked hard to increase the amount of information available on our own site â€“ in addition to anÂ <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">Education landing page</a> and theÂ <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_and_Open_Educational_Resources">OER portal</a> explaining Creative Commonsâ€™ role as legal and technical infrastructure supporting OER, we have been conducting a series of interviews to help clarify some of the challenges and opportunities of OER in todayâ€™s education landscape.</p>
<p>One major venue for the advancement of OER is through policy change at the local, state, federal, and international levels. DeLaina Tonks is the Director of the <a href="http://www.openhighschool.org/">Open High School of Utah</a> (OHSU).Â The Open High School of Utah is "an online charter high school that is 100% committed to the use of open educational resources," and the curriculum is fully aligned with the Utah State Core Curriculum.Â We talked with DeLaina about how OER can help customize student instruction, OHSU's innovative and collaborative approach to teacher training and professional development, and the ongoing awareness, logistics, and incentive structures that are needed for OER production and sharing to increase. The Open High School of Utah begins its second year of operation today.</p>

<p><strong>Can you briefly describe the history of the Open High School of Utah, and how the school's mission relates to the mission of open education? </strong></p>
<p>The Open High School of Utah was founded by Dr. David Wiley and approved for charter by the Utah State Office of Education in 2007. OHSU completed its inaugural year with 125 9th grade students, and on August 23rd, 2010, we will add 125 10th graders for the 2010-2011 school year. By 2013 OHSU will offer 9th-12th grade courses to potentially 1500 students.</p>
<p>The Open High School of Utah is putting the focus where it should be â€“ on the student. Our mission is to facilitate lifelong success by meeting the needs of the 21st century learner through individualized, student-centered instruction, innovative technology, service learning, and personal responsibility. OHSU is a public charter school designed to meet the needs of the 21st century student. As an online school, we combine state of the art curriculum with strategic one-on-one instruction. Our methods can be described as â€œone-on-one tutoring for every student in every subjectâ€. Instruction is individualized allowing students to work at their pace. Our delivery of education is structured to provide maximum flexibility that is student-centered; responsive to the needs of each learner, eliminating the negative aspects of a one-size-fits-all system.Â Our technology sets us apart.Â  It is data-driven, providing real time information that instantaneously tracks the student and their performance. Unique to OHSU is our commitment to share the curriculum we have developed as an open educational resource.Â All of these elements combined make the Open High School of Utah the future of education. We are the face of innovation.</p>
<p>The objective behind creating open content is to create free and simple access to knowledge and information through collaboration and innovation. The OHSU mission dovetails nicely with that of open education because we are among the first, if not the first, secondary school to create our own OER curriculum and share it worldwide. We are thrilled that there are already multiple international groups eagerly awaiting the release of our first batch of courses on August 25, 2010, most notably <a href="http://ocw.core.org.cn/CORE/">CORE China Open Resources for Education</a>.</p>
<p><strong>OHSU champions individualized instruction for its students, using technology and data-driven, realtime assessment tools. And, the OHSU curriculum content is comprised of Open Educational Resources. What are the efficiencies and pedagogical advantages of using OER within this system? Can you give a specific example of how a teacher will utilize an OER to build a lesson for a student, and how technology tools can return data to see if the student is hitting the learning benchmarks for that particular lesson? </strong></p>
<p>The simple fact that our curriculum is housed online in such a data-rich environment provides us with invaluable, real-time information that allows us to best meet learner needs. Students who are fairly impatient digital natives, growing up in the video-game era of instant gratification don't have the patience to wait for a week, or even three days, to have an assessment graded and returned. In a bricks and mortar setting the work flow might look something like this:Â <em>Day One</em>: the teacher makes copies of the test, pass it out, the students take it during their 50-90 minute class, and turn it in.Â <em>Day Two</em>: the teacher grades the tests and enters them into a gradebook (electronic or hardcopy).Â <em>Day Three</em>: the teacher hands tests back to the students when they come to class.</p>
<p>The virtual arena presents a much more efficient model:Â <em>Day One</em>: Students work through online activities, take the assessment, portions are computer-graded giving almost instantaneous real-time scores, others are quickly hand-graded for balance and the student is notified of their complete grade in a very short timeframe. Instant feedback enhances performance.</p>
<p>Pedagogically, OER makes it possible to customize instruction. Special education is an area where OER and technology are critical to the success of our students. We have the ability to create mp3 files of our OER text so that aural learners or students with reading disabilities have an alternate way to receive the information. The use of open resources also makes it possible to very easily modify the curriculum to meet student needs. One of our ninth grade students reads at a third grade level, so our special education teacher reworks the existing higher-level curriculum so that her student can understand it better.</p>
<p>All of our curriculum is standards-aligned, down to a granular level of test questions and lessons. The real-time data allows teachers to look at the collective test results broken down by question to see which ones are missed most often. Teachers are trained to then assess the test question itself. Is it confusing? Can it be clarified? If the test question is valid, the teacher can quickly find the content where that particular standard was taught. Is the content confusing? Can additional clarifying information be added? Is another practice activity warranted to make sure students understand the concept? Within 30 minutes the teacher will have improved the curriculum by first using data to target weaknesses in the open content, and by then finding or creating additional resources to assist in boosting student comprehension, retention and ultimately understanding.</p>
<p>Teachers also look at individual scores and pinpoint where each student could use some additional instruction. If it becomes obvious that a certain student is struggling with factoring, which is in turn affecting their overall math grade, the teacher will videoconference and provide one-on-one tutoring. Teachers also create personalized screencasts/videos that the student can have access to view as many times as is necessary to master the area of weakness. On the next assessment, the teacher can compare scores for questions tied to factoring and see if there has been improvement. Having this type of data at their fingertips, coupled with adaptable open educational resources equals meeting individual learner needs.</p>
<p><strong>The OHSU curriculum is aligned with Utah state standards "to ensure the highest quality educational experience." This is an important consideration for the growth of open education, because if OER does not align with standards, it will most likely be used less. Utah will be adopting the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">Common Core State Standards</a></strong><strong>. What are the challenges to implementing content standards and aligning OER with these standards? </strong></p>
<p>These are the instructions our curriculum writers are given prior to gathering, organizing and creating open educational resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Open High School of Utah curriculum is 1) standards-based and 2) built from OER.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Each course is based on the Utah State Core Standards which are the foundation that the content is built upon.Â Courses are organized into 18 weeks, which each week addressing specific objectives. When building a course, lesson content is built, aligned to the standards, from available OER or self-created materials. OER versions of OHSU courses will be released to the public and must be built on content that conforms to OER guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Objectives should be assigned to each unit, folder, content page, assignment, assessment, and individual questions. By doing this, we will be able to have accurate data to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction and course materials, allowing us to adapt, evolve and improve the curriculum over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have discovered that the most effective way to ensure standards alignment is to use them as the organizing principle or framework for the course. Teachers can then gather existing OER materials, organize them accordingly and fill in any gaps with teacher created materials. The greatest challenge our curriculum writers face is wading through the available OER and determining which content to use in order to create a cohesive course.</p>
<p><strong>OHSU is committed to sharing the curriculum and resources it's developed, to be usable by anyone at anytime. The first round of course materials will be published in August 2010. Is there a specific open content license that the materials will be offered under? What sorts of considerations were taken into account when deciding on a content license for the OHSU OER materials?</strong></p>
<p>Course materials produced by the Open High School of Utah are licensed under aÂ Creative CommonsÂ Attribution 3.0Â License. Open educational resources produced by other individuals or organizations that are embedded in Open High School of Utah course materials may be licensed under a different openÂ license, so we notify potential users toÂ please confirm theÂ licenseÂ status of any third-party resources before revising or remixing them.</p>
<p>We are thrilled that Creative Commons exists and provides a way to license content outside of a one-size-fits-all copyright system. CC licenses are adaptable to any particular situation, especially important for the Open High School of Utah since we gather content from so many different sources prior to arranging and compiling it as our own. A major consideration in choosing to CC license our curriculum is that our philosophies on sharing and collaboration are so closely intertwined.</p>
<p><strong>Many teachers receive confusing information about whether they are able to share the educational resources they create. A <a href="http://www.rules.utah.gov/publicat/bulletin/2009/20091201/33147.htm">Utah Administrative Rule</a></strong><strong> clarifies that teachers are allowed to share curriculum materials under open licenses, specifically Creative Commons licenses. Can this rule be used as a model for other states, and what do you think are some of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to teachers sharing curriculum content? </strong></p>
<p>Conceptually this appears to be a good administrative rule to have in place, and could be a step in the right direction.Â The practical application is more difficult to implement, however. On a granular level the challenges become several fold:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Awareness</em>: educating superintendents, administrators and faculty on the intricacies of when and how to use the Creative Commons licenses</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Logistics</em>: creating a repository or streamlined method of cataloging, and distributing OER content once it is CC licensed, otherwise multiple filing cabinets and hard drives contain countless licensable lesson plans that never see the light of day</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Motivation</em>: cultivating intrinsic motivation for teachers to share their resources with fellow teachers outside of their department, school, and district</li>
</ul>
<p>As a teacher, I was continually told to be very careful with regard to copyright laws, that whatever I produced as a teacher actually belonged to the school since it was being created with taxpayer dollars, and that I was allowed to distribute within the department but not throughout the school or district. This type of territorial behavior in our schools is counterproductive to what schools should be doing; educating children, not fighting over fiefdoms.Â Time will tell if the Utah Administrative Rule has the type of impact I would hope it could have, were it followed by every educator in the state.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously, the faculty at OHSU are familiar with creating and sharing OER. What professional development or training do OHSU faculty go through to learn best practices for use of OER? In your opinion, what are the major hurdles teachers outside of OHSU face in incorporating OER in their teaching?</strong></p>
<p>At the Open High School of Utah, we are continuously focused on improving the process for creating our OER content as evidenced by these three phases--</p>
<p><em>Advance Preparation and Teacher Expectations</em>: We started out hiring subject matter experts and instructional designers to build curriculum for OHSU, and throughout the process determined that a critical element was missing; that of teacher input and guidance. We invest a lot of time and effort in auditioning teachers to create curriculum for us, and have instituted an extensive process to ensure that we have the very best fit available. We post the position, gather resumes, and invite teachers to progress to the second phase of the interview process which consists of building a lesson for us from open educational resources. We supply them with two pages of resources and websites, give them a week and see what they can come up with. Those who are unwilling to put in the time and effort self-terminate from the eligible pool of applicants and we end up with 5-6 terrific lesson plans to choose from. At that point we interview the top three, based on answers to written questions and the lesson plan itself. The process is very open and transparent because we essentially ask them to prove that they can create OER lessons by doing just that. We then hire the teacher who possesses a personality that translates well in the online arena, who has proven that he/she is capable of OER lesson creation, and is dedicated to supporting the vision and mission of the Open High School of Utah.</p>
<p><em>New Teacher Training</em>:<em> </em>Once a teacher is officially hired to create content for the Open High School of Utah, we provide an intensive two-day training on curriculum design, OER, tech tips and tools and answer any questions they may have. There is a great deal of unplanned collaboration that comes out of this training and it allows teachers to get to know each other and feel comfortable sharing ideas.</p>
<p><em>Ongoing Professional Development</em>:<em> </em>In addition, we provide ongoing support from our curriculum director, who combs through every page created to ensure consistency in design and formatting, appropriate use of OER, and alignment to state standards. The curriculum director serves as an invaluable resource to guide our teachers through the OER creation process. At every faculty meeting we highlight the work of one or two teachers as they take us on a walkthrough of their virtual course. They share new resources, technology they have incorporated, and anecdotal experiences of how students are reacting to the course material. In addition, each teacher is enrolled as a student in every other teacher's course so they can view the curriculum on their own and gain insights and ideas to incorporate into their own classes. In this online setting, the openness and transparency of viewing everyone's curriculum creates a collaborative setting so the collective result is better than anything an individual teacher can come up with on his/her own. The old adage, "A rising tide lifts all boats" holds true for the faculty of the Open High School of Utah.</p>
<p>Outside of the Open High School of Utah, especially in the virtual setting, much of the curriculum is designed by corporations and delivered part and parcel to the students with little to no input from the teachers. A textbook publisher in Texas is designing curriculum for students in Indiana, and the people closest to their students, the teachers, have very little local control to customize the curriculum to meet the needs of their learners. That said, in a brick and mortar setting, good teachers find or create supplemental content on a regular basis, but are either unaware that they are able to license their work, or don't have a common repository in which to share their work outside of their department.</p>
<p><strong>How do you see the role of Creative Commons within the OER movement? How can CC help?</strong></p>
<p>The mission of Creative Commons, to increase sharing and improve collaboration, is powerful for all of the right reasons. It hearkens back to the things we learned in Kindergarten about sharing and playing nice with others. The best part about Creative Commons is the breadth of licensing options available to educators in all arenas, and how nicely they dovetail with open-source curriculum, giving us the ability to select the license that best fits our needs. The challenge becomes increasing awareness, helping educators to understand how best to use Creative Commons and why it is important, and providing a forum in which to publish. The Open High School of Utah is doing its part by releasing several courses at the end of this month, all appropriately CC licensed, of course, which will draw attention to the merits of Creative Commons licensing. Keep up the good work!</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping up, what does a successful teaching and learning environment implementing the power of OER â€œlook likeâ€? Do you have any lingering thoughts â€” worries, hopes, predictions?</strong></p>
<p>This is perhaps the most exciting aspect of the Open High School of Utah! Every student's educational experience can be customized to best fit their needs, turning the one-size-fits-all, teach-to-the-middle education system on its head. For example, at OHSU if a student is struggling with factoring, the teacher creates an additional, personalized screencast highlighting specifically where the student is going wrong, complete with suggestions and examples on how to fix the problem. The online delivery allows the curriculum to be housed in the cloud, freeing up teacher hours to work with students in a one-on-one setting, giving them what they need, when they need it, so they can move on. This teaching model coupled with the use of OER can produce amazing results that will hopefully reignite the passion for learning that we all possessed in Kindergarten.</p>
