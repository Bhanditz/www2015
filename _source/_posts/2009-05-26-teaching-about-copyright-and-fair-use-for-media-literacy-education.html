<p>Last November, the Center for Social Media at AU released a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10618">Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education</a>, which followed on the heels of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8460">Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Online Video</a>. These guides were aimed at clearing up many of the urban myths surrounding copyright, especially when it came to classroom use of copyrighted materials.</p>
<p>Now, the Media Education Lab at Temple University has produced <a href="http://mediaeducationlab.com/code-best-practices-fair-use-media-literacy-education">excellent resources</a> based on the original guide to help teachers teach about copyright and fair use in their classrooms. Resources include lesson plans, Powerpoint slides, videos, case studies, podcasts, and FAQs. The lesson plans iterate on topics from the code such as "Understanding Copyright", "The Cost of Copyright Confusion", and "Defining and Applying Fair Use". </p>
<p>What tickles me: that in order to find out just what you can do with these resources, you get to view and use them first---Learning fair use via fair using! To use these resources in your classroom or study group (or for simply personal edification), check them all out <a href="http://mediaeducationlab.com/code-best-practices-fair-use-media-literacy-education">here</a>. </p>
