<p>In December 2011 the U.S. House of Representatives introduced <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3699/show">The Research Works Act (H.R.3699)</a>, a bill that will ban public access to publicly funded research. <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/">SPARC</a> says, "Essentially, the bill seeks to prohibit federal agencies from conditioning their grants to require that articles reporting on publicly funded research be made accessible to the public online." The bill was introduced by Reps. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY). The <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-is-open-internet-champion-darrell-issa-supporting-an-attack-on-open-science/250929/">sponsorship by Issa is odd</a> considering his strong support for <a href="http://www.keepthewebopen.com/">OPEN Act</a>, the tolerable alternative to the  SOPA/PIPA legislation. The bill stands in stark contrast to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/07/request-information-public-access-digital-data-and-scientific-publications">OSTP's recent request for ideas</a> about how the U.S. government can support public access to federally funded <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/11/04/2011-28623/request-for-information-public-access-to-peer-reviewed-scholarly-publications-resulting-from">research articles</a> and <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/11/04/2011-28621/request-for-information-public-access-to-digital-data-resulting-from-federally-funded-scientific">digital data</a> (note: you can still submit comments until January 12 to the OSTP call). One of the primary proponents of the The Research Works Act is The Association of American Publishers, who describe the bill in a <a href="http://www.publishers.org/press/56/">press release</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Research Works Act will prohibit federal agencies from unauthorized free public dissemination of journal articles that report on research which, to some degree, has been federally-funded but is produced and published by private sector publishers receiving no such funding. It would also prevent non-government authors from being required to agree to such free distribution of these works. Additionally, it would preempt federal agenciesâ€™ planned funding, development and back-office administration of their own electronic repositories for such works, which would duplicate existing copyright-protected systems and unfairly compete with established university, society and commercial publishers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The legislation would be toxic for progressive initiatives such as the NIH's <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">Public Access Policy</a>, which requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the PubMed Central digital archive. PubMed Central provides free public access to research the public pays for. SPARC's <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/action/action_access/12-0106.shtml">Alliance for Taxpayer Access website</a> has outlined specific ways that supporters of public access can speak out against this proposed legislation. Especially helpful is contacting the Congressional offices listed below. Please voice your support for public access to publicly funded research.  </p>
