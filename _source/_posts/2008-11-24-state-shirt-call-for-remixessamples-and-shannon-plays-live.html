<p>Over a year and a half ago the ccMixter community decided to stop having formal remix contests in part because in a CC context, the traditional format seemed outdated. In a typical remix contest an artist would post the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_(music)">stems</a> to one song, retaining all the rights to the samples as well as the <i>remixes</i> produced by the entrants. After the contest deadline, the samples are typically taken off the web site in order to take them out of official circulation. </p>
<p>By contrast, on ccMixter, we've turned to a 'call for remixes' model where we get the artist to put the stems for an <em>entire album</em> into the Commons and keep it there. Therefore the concept of a 'deadline' seems mute. The best part is that the rights to the remixes are retained by the artist. This has proven to be much more amenable to the community and it has responded with 1,000s of remixes to calls by <a href="http://ccmixter.org/bbe">DJ Vadim</a>, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/buckyjonson">Bucky Jonson</a>, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/trifonic">Trifonic</a>,<a href="http://ccmixter.org/artist-spotlight-q-a?topic=calendar-girl">Calendar Girl</a>, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/artist-spotlight-q-a?topic=brad-sucks">Brad Sucks</a> and  <a href="http://ccmixter.org/shannon-hurley">Shannon Hurley</a>.</p>
<p>Shannon exemplifies the new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10949">hybrid sharing+business model</a> because when we she was ready to put together an album of remixes she licensed, for a fee, the remixes from the producers for the album "Second Light: The Ready to Wake Up Remixes" (<a href="http://amiestreet.com/music/shannon-hurley/second-light-the-ready-to-wake-up-remixes/">AMIE Street</a>, <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/shannonhurley4">CD Baby</a> and iTunes).</p>
<p>She will be performing the remixes with Ben Eisen on bass, Sam Cunningham on drums, and "my apple notebook" in Los Angeles on December 10th.  This gig will be quite the party as ccMixter producer <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/DJ_Doughy">DJ Doughy</a> will be flying from Kansas City, Mo. and I'll be making a special trip to LA for this event as well. (There is a $12 charge at the door.)</p>
<p>Shannon Hurley Remix Album Release Party<br />
Wed. Dec. 10th<br />
8pm sharp, all ages<br />
<a href="http://www.genghiscohen.com/">Genghis Cohen</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=740+N+Fairfax+Ave+Los+Angeles,+CA+90046">map</a>)<br />
740 N. Fairfax Ave.<br />
Los Angeles, CA 90046<br />
$12 admission</p>
<p>Our latest call has special significance because we've been trying to get indie star <a href="http://stateshirt.com">State Shirt</a> for a while and he's come through in a big way. Not only did he put his entire "<a href="http://www.stateshirt.com/music/">This is Old</a>" album, stems, a cappellas and all, into the Commons but his plan is to use the remixes themselves as source material for a new album of <i>original</i> music. State is a master songwriter who writes and performs in an "energetic and ridiculously catchy" way according to <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/DoKashiteru/17807">DoKashiteru</a> who should know: his <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/DoKashiteru/17807">DnB smasher remix</a> was an Editor Pick minutes after upload.</p>
<p>The State Shirt call is: "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/state-shirt">Remix Me So I Can Remix You</a>"</p>
<p>He says: "Creative Commons is the perfect antidote for a collapsing landscape still clinging to traditional copyright. I hope more artists discover that freedom, flexibility, collaboration and community are now an option. I also hope that my fellow ccMixters would want to get involved with me, in both the creation and re-creation of music."</p>
