<p><a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">Flatworld Knowledge</a>, an open textbook initiative that has been in development since 2007, received $8 million in investments earlier this week. That's right. $8 million. In investments, not grants. </p>
<p>The open textbook world got a lot of press <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9470">last fall</a>, and I'm guessing that not long after it started piquing the interest of the rich (and maybe famous). I don't know; have you heard of Valhalla Partners, Greenhill SAVP, and High Peaks Venture Partners? They, along with several angel investors, are the ones who believe Flatworld Knowledge (aka open textbooks) will be the next big thing. From the <a href="http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-24-2009/0004993532&amp;EDATE=">press release</a>:</p>
<p><em>"This is an exciting investment," said Hooks Johnston, General Partner at Valhalla Partners. "Like MP3's blew up the delivery model for recorded music, the blogosphere and online news sources blew up the newspaper business, Flat World Knowledge is poised to blow up the college textbook market. We're backing the perfect team to make it happen."</em></p>
<p>What makes an open textbook? Open licensing. Flatworld Knowledge currently has 22 business and economics textbooks in development, with 10 titles set for faculty review (almost) right about now. All of their textbooks will be open under one of the Creative Commons licenses, allowing you to not only freely access the books online, but to adapt, modify, and derive them, depending on the license.</p>
