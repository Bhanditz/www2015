<p><a href="http://www.nationbeat.com/html/about.php">Nation Beat</a>, a musical group that "bridges folkloric Brazilian rhythms with classic American roots music", is set to release their sophomore album, <em>Legends of the Preacher</em>, on July 15th 2008. In conjunction with their release, Nation Beat and record label <a href="http://www.modiba.net/">Modiba Productions</a> are sponsoring <a href="http://www.modiba.net/nationbeat/">an animation contest based on the band and their songs</a>, with the animation assets released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">BY-NC license</a>. From Nation Beat/Modiba Productions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Entrants are asked to submit 60-90 second animated music video shorts featuring a track of their choice.  Modiba will offer ï¬les from the album's original artwork featuring the band members as cartoon characters. The ï¬les will be offered in both InDesign and Flash formats, and will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license, so that they can be used in animated videos by contestants.  In addition to the $500 cash prize, the winning video will be featured on NationalGeographic.com, Nation Beat and Modibaâ€™s websites, Myspace pages, and a variety of other media outlets.</p></blockquote>
<p>To submit an entry, participants must upload their finalized videos to YouTube and send a link to <strong>info AT modiba DOT net</strong>. By CC licensing the animation assets, Nation Beat and Modiba Productions are able to facilitate an interactive and user-friendly means for fans to engage with <em>Legends of the Preacher</em>, all while retaining their commercial rights. This allows Nation Beat the ability to  license their music outside of the competition and provides a means for enhanced fan interaction, two vital, yet often difficult to reconcile, methods of music promotion.</p>
