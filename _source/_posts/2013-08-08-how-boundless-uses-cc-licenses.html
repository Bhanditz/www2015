<p>As the open educational resources (<a href="/education#OER">OER</a>) movement continues to grow, students and educators alike can benefit from openly licensed content. The use of <a href="/licenses">Creative Commons licenses</a> in education has allowed learning resources to travel farther, reach more people, and be repurposed to meet local needs. </p>
<p>I recently spoke with Ariel Diaz, CEO of <a href="http://boundless.com/">Boundless</a> learning about how his company utilizes Creative Commons CC licenses. This is a summary of our conversation.</p>
<h3>So how does Boundless use Creative Commons licenses?</h3>
<p>"Creating high quality textbooks is no easy task. It would have been impossible for Boundless to create close to 20 subjects worth of open textbooks without the availability of openly licensed content. While we can also use information that is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>, the license on the content we predominantly use is called <a href="/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)</a>. CC BY-SA allows us to tweak and build upon the work of others, even for commercial purposes, and we are required to license our derivative works under the same license terms. To maintain a connection to the original author, we give attribution/credit and mark our content with the same license.   </p>
<p>"To create our <a href="http://boundless.com/textbooks/">open textbooks</a> and study tools, our team of expert "Edcurators" find the best content that is openly licensed. They revise and remix the best parts of the best content so that it is aligned with the key concepts of a corresponding traditional textbook for subjects like <a href="https://www.boundless.com/marketing/">Marketing</a>, <a href="https://www.boundless.com/chemistry/">Chemistry</a>, and <a href="https://www.boundless.com/writing/">Writing</a>. In other words, we take openly licensed content and add our own layer of pedagogy (important because our audience is students) and copy editing (important because students deserve to have materials written in a consistent voice that is fit for their grade level). Once the curating process is finished, we've officially crafted a resource that <a href="http://blog.boundless.com/2013/01/boundless-open-textbook-revolution-takes-off/">helps students at over half the colleges in the U.S. excel</a>. Our educational content is <a href="https://www.boundless.com/oer/">openly available</a> to all students anywhere in the world."</p>
<h4>Why are Creative Commons licenses important to Boundless?</h4>
<p>"Creative Commons has revolutionized the process of sharing information. Open resources available under a CC license broadens the distribution of knowledge, allowing people of different ages, socioeconomic statuses, and geographic locations to share and benefit from high quality content. It's amazing to be part of this revolution.</p>
<p>"In addition to helping us find, curate, and remix high-quality educational content, the CC license helps us stand up for an important belief core to our mission: educational resources should be free and openly licensed.</p>
<p>"We make good on this belief by freely posting our <a href="https://www.boundless.com/textbooks/">open textbooks</a> on the web, without any registration required. Any student, educator, or self-learner can access, quote, and remix our textbooks for their own purposes thanks to the CC BY-SA license. Openly licensed educational resources means that digital textbooks like ours will continue to improve over time, <a href="http://blog.boundless.com/2012/06/bridging-the-gap-between-oer-and-students/">allowing students the chance to unlock the knowledge they deserve</a>."</p>
<h4>Where can I access Boundless textbooks?</h4>
<p>"In addition to the <a href="https://www.boundless.com/textbooks/">web</a>, Boundless is has released these books for free in one of the world's most popular ebook stores: the iBookstore (with Kindle support coming soon). The company's iBooks include titles like Boundless Introduction to Marketing, Introduction to Statistics, and Introduction to Writing. Students can now access Boundless' high-quality, college-level content online, offline, on any device, at anytime. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boundless-textbooks/id661340407?ls=1&mt=8">Boundless App</a> is available for free from the App Store on iPhone and iPod touch."</p>
