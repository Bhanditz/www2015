<p>This week's featured content is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/rick">Rick Prelinger</a>'s new film <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=feature_films&collectionid=panorama_ephemera">Panorama Ephemera</a>, produced entirely with short government clips from the 1940s-1970s. For those in the Bay Area, it will be shown at the San Francisco Cinematheque on Sunday, June 13 at 7:30 pm. The clips range from the everyday normal to the absolutely bizarre and together form an amusing collage of how life used to be.</p>
