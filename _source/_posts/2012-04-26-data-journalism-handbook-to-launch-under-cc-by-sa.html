<p>A joint initiative of the European Journalism Centre and the Open Knowledge Foundation, the collaborative book effort was <a href="http://datadrivenjournalism.net/news_and_analysis/hacks_and_hackers_gather_to_write_the_first_data_journalism_handbook">kicked off</a> at the 2011 Mozilla Festival: Media, Freedom and the Web -- which gathered reporters, data journalism practitioners, advocates, and journalism and related organizations from around the globe. Over three days, participants researched, wrote, and edited chapters of the handbook. Contributors include the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC, the Chicago Tribune, Deutsche Welle, the Guardian, the Financial Times, La Nacion, The New York Times, ProPublica, The Washington Post, and many others -- including Creative Commons. Creative Commons contributed to various pieces of the "Getting Data" section, including "Using and Sharing Data: the Black Letter, Fine Print, and Reality." You can preview the outline <a href="http://datadrivenjournalism.net/news_and_analysis/A_peek_inside_the_Data_Journalism_Handbook">here</a>.</p>
<p>From the announcement,</p>
<blockquote><p>Now more than ever, journalists need to know how to work with data. From covering public spending to elections, the Wikileaks cables to the financial crisis - journalists need to know where to find and request key datasets, how to make sense of them, and how to present them to the public.<br />
<br />
Jonathan Gray, lead editor for the handbook, says: â€œThe book gives us an unprecedented, behind-the-scenes look at how data is used by journalists around the world - from big news organisations to citizen reporters. We hope it will serve to inform and inspire a new generation of data journalists to use the information around us to communicate complex and important issues to the public.</p></blockquote>
