<h2>More about the European Academy of Law and Computing (EEAR), Merzig and SaarbrÃ¼cken</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eear.eu" target="_blank">European Academy of Law and Computing</a> was established in the year 2005 as a non-profit corporation situated in Merzig and SaarbrÃ¼cken, near the borders to France and Luxemburg in south-western Germany. The Academy wants to build bridges between the IT sector and the world of legal professionals. Its mission therefore is threefold, combining research activities, educational courses and development of software and services.</p>
<p>In the area of research the Academy offers various workshops, conducts EU funded studies and hosts the Merzig Legal Database Forum (<a href="http://www.eear.eu/index.php?id=3" target="_blank">Merziger Datenbankenforum Recht</a>), to name a few. In regard to education and additional qualification for lawyers a fully equipped test environment is on offer as well as a wide range of courses, covering topics like XML, Digital Data Management and Legal Web Services. The development activities include the German Database of Higher Education Law (<a href="http://www.eear.eu/kmk-hochschulrecht/" target="_blank">KMK Hochschulrecht</a>), the Caveat Registry Service, applications for implementing the XJustiz standard, and other projects.</p>

<h2>More about Institute of Law and Informatics (Institut fÃ¼r Rechtsinformatik) at Saarland University, SaarbrÃ¼cken</h2>
<p>The 'SaarbrÃ¼cker Rechtsinformatik' (Law and Informatics in SaarbrÃ¼cken) was founded in 1988 along with the establishment of the department of law and informatics, which was originally funded by the Stifterverband fÃ¼r die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Donors' Association for the Promotion of Sciences and Humanities in Germany) and headed by Prof. Dr. Herberger. Today the Institute of Law and Informatics at Saarland University (UniversitÃ¤t des Saarlandes in SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany) is maintained by the <a href="http://herberger.jura.uni-sb.de/" target="_blank">Chair for Civil Law, Legal Theory and Legal Informatics</a> of Prof. Dr. Maximilian Herberger and the <a href="http://ruessmann.jura.uni-sb.de/" target="_blank">Chair for Civil Law, Civil Procedure and Philosophy of Law</a> of Prof. Dr. Helmut RÃ¼ÃŸmann.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.rechtsinformatik.de/pages/home.php?lang=EN">Institute of Law and Informatics</a> concerns itself with the question of how legal professionals can improve their ways of working with the aid of new technology. Law and informatics is part of applied information technology just like business information systems and medical informatics are. In this context the Institute of Law and Informatics feels that it is its duty to make legal information electronically available, therefore deviating from the traditional printed format, and to support the electronic exchange of legal documents. Examples include online legal databases as well as the technical maintenance of the decision databases of the Courts, for example the <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/" target="_blank">websites of the Federal Constitutional Court</a>, the Social, Labour and Fiscal Courts of the Saarland as well as the Administrative Court in Frankfurt am Main.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Institute of Law and Informatics deals with Information Law and legal problems of new media, especially Internet Law. The Internet poses many legal questions, which concern current and future legislation of almost all areas of law and numerous regulations. In relation to the named issues the Institute concentrates mainly on questions of civil law.</p>
