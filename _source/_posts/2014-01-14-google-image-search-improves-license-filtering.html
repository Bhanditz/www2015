<p>If you use <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Image Search</a> to look for CC-licensed photographs, you might have noticed an improvement to the interface this week. Rather than having to hunt for it in the advanced search options, you can now filter by CC license right from the "Search Tools" menu on the search results page.</p>
<p>You can also get to Google Image Search results - along with results from numerous other search engines - through our <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons Search</a> page.</p>
