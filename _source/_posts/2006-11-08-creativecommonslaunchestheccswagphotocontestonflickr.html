<p>Today, Creative Commons launched the first <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">CC Swag Photo Contest</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> to promote our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">Annual Fundraising Campaign</a>. The contest offers a chance for people to win prizes for creatively photographing their CC Swag (t-shirts, buttons, stickers, etc. â€” all available from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/store">Support the Commons store</a>) and showing their support for CC during this critical fundraising period. Two winners will have their photos used on Creative Commons' informational postcards, which will be distributed internationally to promote CC and the winning photographers. Winners will receive 100 copies of the postcard with their photo. The winners will also be able to choose a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people">Creative Commons board member</a> to record a personalized outgoing voicemail announcement â€” that's right, your friends can be greeted by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#0">Lawrence Lessig</a> every time they call you! For more information, please visit the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest">contest page</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/contest_rules">read the rules</a>.</p>
