<p>As an advocate of open education, ccLearn supports openness across a variety of fields, and, generally speaking, we would prefer to see things as openly licensed as possible. That's why when we stumbled across this <a href="http://sarah-stewart.blogspot.com/2008/03/open-access-education-at-otago.html" title="http://sarah-stewart.blogspot.com/2008/03/open-access-education-at-otago.html">interview</a> with Otago Polytechnic in New Zealand, we were delighted to find this quote about the role of Creative Commons in making vocational courses (from Automotive Engineering to Midwifery) open access:</p>
<p>"The recognition of Creative Commons with attribution as our default position has been widely accepted and feedback has been that it has been instrumental in building OP's reputation as an educational provider."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/" title="http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/">Otago Polytechnic</a> offers its open access courses under the Creative Commons Attribution License (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/">CC BY</a>). Check out their <a href="http://www.wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic" title="http://www.wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic">WikiEducator page</a> that has staff-developed Open Educational Resources.</p>
