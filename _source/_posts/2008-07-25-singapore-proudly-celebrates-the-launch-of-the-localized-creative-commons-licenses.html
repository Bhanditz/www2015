<p>We are delighted to announce the successful localization of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/sg/">Creative Commons licenses in Singapore</a>, the 47th worldwide to do so. The CC Singapore team, led by Associate Professor Samtani Anil and Assistant Professor Giorgios Cheliotis, has worked under the auspices of the <a href="http://captel.ntu.edu.sg/">Centre for Asia Pacific Technology Law &amp; Policy (CAPTEL)</a> and in collaboration with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/">Creative Commons International</a> to port the licenses to Singaporean law.</p>
<p>The launch event will be celebrated on Sunday, July 27, at the <a href="http://www.isea2008singapore.org/conference/conf_panels.html">International Symposium on Electronic Art</a>. The ceremony will be followed by several panels organized by CATPEL and Creative Commons Singapore on copyright issues in digital media and a keynote address from Professor Lawrence Lessig. For more in information we invite you to read our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/8517">press release</a>.<br />

Congratulations, CC Singapore!</em></p>
