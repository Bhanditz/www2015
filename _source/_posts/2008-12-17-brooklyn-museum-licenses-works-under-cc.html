<p>Our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10841">new affinity</a> for micro-blogging has been a huge success so far, allowing us to engage with those in the CC community in a more personal and exciting manner. One of the biggest rewards is that we are finding out about a bevy of cool projects using CC that would have otherwise slipped under our radar. </p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/brooklynmuseum/status/1049745492">This tweet</a> by <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/">The Brooklyn Museum</a> got our particular interest - <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/copyright.php">everything they hold the copyright </a>to is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND license</a>, allowing for free sharing of their content. This should come as no surprise considering <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8381">their contribution</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons?PHPSESSID=ea7b4da468f5935f24b65f41dbfc356f">Flickr: The Commons</a> (<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/16/new-york-public-libr.html">joined today</a> by the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nypl/">New York Public Library</a>) and their new "socially networked museum membership", <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/join/1stfans/">1st fans</a>, but is an inspiring choice nonetheless.</p>
