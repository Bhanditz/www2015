<p>We had a wonderful response from the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28349">Call for Participation</a> in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LRMI">Learning Resource Metadata Initiative</a> (LRMI) Technical Working Group with highly qualified individuals and representatives from many leading organizations in the education field. (As you may <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27603">recall</a>, LRMI is a project led by Creative Commons and the Association of Educational Publishers to establish a common vocabulary for describing learning resources.) After consultation with the LRMI project partners, we needed to balance all the restrictions of an efficient, productive, and representative working group along with the large numbers of qualified potential members.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/LRMI/Technical_Working_Group">LRMI Technical Working Group</a> membership is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheryl Abshire, Calcasieu Parish Public School System</li>
<li>Phil Barker, JISC CETIS</li>
<li>Dan Brickley, VU University Amsterdam</li>
<li>Brian Carver, UC Berkeley School of Information</li>
