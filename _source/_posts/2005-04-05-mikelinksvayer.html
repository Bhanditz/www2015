<p>(Next in a continuing series of blurbs about Commoners I'm thankful to have worked with.)</p>
<p>If there is one person whose heroics are most unsung at Creative Commons, it could very well be <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#21">Mike Linksvayer</a>. Mike has been the CTO for about two years. He came on at a crucial time, when CC was growing jerkily from a loose network of contractors to a real organization, and he brought stability from the get-go. Stability isn't sexy, and it's not very visible from the outside. If CC is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5376">like a band</a>, then Mike's the drummer. People not in bands rarely ever get how much a tasteful, subdued drummer matters. But people in bands know that they're impossibly valuable. And CC, when you boil it down, is all about the drums.</p>
<p>Mike is the force behind, among other things: the vibrant <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss#metadata">cc-metadata mailing list</a> (our most active), our membership at the <a href="http://w3.org">W3C</a>, our amazing multi-language license interface and Commons Deeds (have you taken a good look at our stuff in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/fi/legalcode">Suomeski</a>?, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=nl">Dutch</a>? -- amazing!), the discovery and harnessing of the mighty talent called Nathan Yergler (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5165">profiled here earlier</a>), the move to leverage CC Search off <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4388">Nutch</a>'s open code base, countless <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/challenges">tech developments and deals</a>, a huge chunk of our blog posts, and who-knows-how-many other technological things that I don't know about (because I simply don't understand them). Something else you may not know: He also knows the the nitty-gritty of our licenses as well as anyone.</p>
<p>Mike's got a fine, bleak sense of humor, which I for one appreciate. This year he sported the best, most efficient Halloween costume -- shorts, and a tshirt declaring a single phrase -- that I've seen in a while. Maybe the same fearlessness that fuels his humor also drives his ability to call anyone on their b.s. -- a skill and a will that are rare and crucial in this "space."</p>
<p>Another thing I love about Mike is his taste. I'm a firm believer in the notion that the more stuff you hate, the better taste you have. Mike, I can testify, hates a lot of stuff. Which means he loves the stuff only really worth loving. So I've learned a lot from him -- about what arguments are too cheesy, what sentiments too sentimental, and not least, what Bay Area radio is actually worth listening to.</p>
<p>Here's a toast to Mike Linksvayer, in the hope I get to work with him again very soon. All of you who still get to are luckier even than you might think.</p>
