<p>The First Annual <a href="http://wfud.info">World's Fair Use Day</a> (WFUD) will be held on Tuesday January 12, 2010 in Washington, D.C. (with events kicking off Monday night). WFUD is being organized byÂ <a href="http://publicknowledge.org">Public Knowledge</a>, and will bring together a wide variety of individuals and groups interested in fair use, including artists, scholars, policymakers, entrepreneurs, media professionals, and consumer advocates. Says PK:</p>
<p><em>World's Fair Use Day is a free, all-day celebration of the doctrine of fair use: the legal right that allows innovators and creators to make particular uses of copyrighted materials. WFUD will take place at the Newseum in Washington D.C. on Tuesday January 12, 2010, and will be organized by Public Knowledge (PK), a Washington D.C.-based non-profit, consumer-advocacy group. PK works to ensure that communications and intellectual property policies encourage creativity, further free expression and discourse and provide universal access to knowledge. As part of its campaign to return balance to copyright law, PK hopes to use WFUD to educate the public about the importance of fair use in an information society.</em></p>
<p>The events are free and open to the public, but RSVP is requested. Come say hello at the CC table in between sessions on Tuesday. See <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/2833">PK's preview</a> of the festivities and the <a href="http://wfud.info">WFUD site</a> for all the pertinent information.</p>
