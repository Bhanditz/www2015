Chairman and co-founder of Creative Commons, <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Larry Lessig</a>, spent most of this week speaking at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ilaw">ILAW conference</a> at Harvard. There are some great notes and transcripts on <a href="http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/index.php?p=1885">Furdlog</a> and <a href="http://www.corante.com/copyfight/archives/003674.html">Copyfight</a> of Lessig's "Free Culture" talk. There are a lot of great questions from the moderator and audience, and a lot of great ideas being debated.</p>
