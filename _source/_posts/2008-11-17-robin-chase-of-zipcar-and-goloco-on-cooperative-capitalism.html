<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Chase">Robin Chase</a>, co-founder and former CEO of car sharing service <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">Zipcar</a>, and current CEO of online carpooling service <a href="http://www.goloco.org/greetings/guest">GoLoco</a> recently wrote a great post entitled <a href="http://networkmusings.blogspot.com/2008/11/time-for-cooperative-capitalism.html">"Time for Cooperative Capitalism"</a> on her blog, Network Musings. In it, Chase describes the need for developing systems that enable the easy and efficient sharing of resources - both online and in the physical world - with a focus on collaborative financing, infrastructure, and consumption. She also offers a simple formula for people, companies, and institutions looking to engage in this approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Identify excess capacity.<br />
2. Build a platform for others to share/engage with this excess capacity.<br />
3. Appreciate unanticipated benefits</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out Chase's <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/robin_chase_on_zipcar_and_her_next_big_idea.html">TED Talk</a> from 2007 (the video is under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND</a> license) that explores some of these same ideas, specifically in ways that apply to transportation.</p>
