<p><a href="http://www.yopob.com/remix.html">Yoko Ono wants you to remix her track "The Sun Is Down!" whose stems are released under a CC Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>. You can download the sample pack which includes the track's vocal effects, loops of bass, drums, sound effects, and Tenorion files.</p>
<p>But Yoko's also running a contest to find the 10 best remixes. Here are the details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Create your own remix of â€œThe Sun Is Down!â€ by Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band, using as many or few of the samples from the pack and any original audio you wish to add.</p>
<p>When you have finished your mix, make an MP3 copy thatâ€™s as high quality as possible, but still under 10MB in size.</p>
<p>Email the MP3 of your mix, along with its name and your name, address, email and phone number to remix@YOPOB.com before 12 December 2009.</p>
<p>The Top Ten mixes will be decided by Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band.</p>
<p>The winners will receive special signed Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band prizes and will be featured on this site over the Xmas and New Year period.</p></blockquote>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://www.yopob.com/remix.html">Yoko Ono's Plastic Ono Band</a> for the full contest details and to download the sample pack.</p>
