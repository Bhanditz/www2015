<p><a href="http://planet.creativecommons.org"><img src="img/right-pcc.png" border="0" style="float:right;border:none;padding:5px;" /></a>In the universe of blogs and other syndicated content, a planet is a service that aggregates a specific set of blogs, usually all relevant to a particular community, so that one may easily follow conversations (or at least blogged updates) in the community or drop in and see what is happening in a community without having to visit many individual blogs (and having to figure out which ones to visit).</p>
<p><a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a> and <a href="http://planet.gnome.org/">Planet GNOME</a> were the first two planets. Now a planet aggregator is a well established communications channel for many large free software communities, complementing mailing lists, IRC, wikis, and individual and project blogs. <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org/">Planet Mozilla</a> is another good example.</p>
<p>We've been syndicating CC jurisdiction project blogs <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7710">on the CC home page</a> for a while. Now you can see more and subscribe at <a href="http://planet.creativecommons.org/jurisdictions/">planet.creativecommons.org/jurisdictions/</a>. Or visit the <b><a href="http://planet.creativecommons.org">Planet Creative Commons</a></b> home page to get this blog, CC jurisdiction blogs, and various CC community blogs all at one time.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Planet_Venus">read about the software that runs the Planet on the CC wiki</a>, including CC engineer Nathan Kinkade's plugin to read <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Syndication">syndicated license information</a>.</p>
