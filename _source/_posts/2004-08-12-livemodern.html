<p><a href="http://livemodern.com/">Live Modern</a> is a new community site that describes themselves as "a free and open community for modern home buyers, architects, builders, developers, lenders, realtors--anyone interested in modernist housing." They've got a Creative Commons license on all their own content, a section devoted to a new, affordable, custom modern home called <a href="http://livemodern.com/glidehouse">The Glide House</a>, <a href="http://www.livemodern.com/Members/jenniekessinger/blog/">a blog</a> started by someone purchasing a Glide home of their own, as well as <a href="http://www.livemodern.com/Members/lavardera/lamidesigndevblog">an architect's blog</a> covering the real-time development of a new home design. If you're into sleek, modern homes, this site is a real treat.</p>
