It has been just over four months since the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13829">launched</a> as a destination for high-quality, freely licensed music. Since that time, the site has developed an <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/blog/">avid community</a> and grown to include a number of <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/dublab/">fantastic</a> <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/CASH_Music/">curators</a> all while expanding upon the site's initial catalog to host over 11,000 tracks. All told, the FMA has, in a very short time frame, become an indispensable destination for music lovers looking for freely-licensed music to download, share, and reuse.</p>
<p>The FMA has always offered and promoted CC licenses as a means to share the majority of music uploaded to the site. Today we are ecstatic to announce that CC has <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/creative_commons">joined the FMA's curatorial ranks</a>! We're celebrating with 50 great tracks that will be <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Nine_Inch_Nails/Ghosts_I-IV/">both</a> <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jonathan_Coulton/">familiar</a> to the CC community while hopefully offering some <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Must_Have_Been_Tokyo_1791">new</a> <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Het_Gloren">names</a> as well. The launch is split into two mixes - our <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/FMA_Inaugural_Mix"><em>FMA Inaugural Mix</em></a> and <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/The_WIRED_CD_Rip_Sample_Mash_Share"><em>The WIRED CD: Rip. Sample. Mash. Share.</em></a></p>
<p>We'll be doing regular updates to our collection over the coming months and our next featured mix will highlight some of the great community-driven artists and collaborations found at sites like <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo</a>, <a href="http://www.beatpick.com/">Beatpick</a>, <a href="http://sutros.com/">Sutros</a>, and more. We are on continuous lookout for great CC-licensed music to add to our page and would love to hear your suggestions on tracks and artists in the comments.</p>
