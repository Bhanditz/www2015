<p>Volunteers from the Albanian community have <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/AlbanianLegalTools">translated the Creative Commons license suite into Albanian</a>, and would like your help to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Talk:AlbanianLegalTools">review</a> the translated text! To leave feedback on the translations, you will need a CC wiki account; once you are logged in, you can comment on the Discussion pages. </p>
<p>Anyone can help translate CC licenses and legal tools via our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_Tools_Translation">License and Legal Tools Translation Project</a>. Though translations of the international licenses (formerly known as the "unported" licenses) cannot be used to license works, the translation process can be useful for helping your community learn  how our licenses operate, and gives others the opportunity to read the licenses in their native language.  Translating the international licenses may be useful for jurisdictions without ported licenses, particularly now that CC has <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Affiliates">suspended new 3.0 porting projects while we prepare for version 4.0. </p>
