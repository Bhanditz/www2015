<p><a href="http://www.50footwave.com/">50 Foot Wave</a>, the excellent rock group fronted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Hersh">Kristin Hersh</a> of seminal post-punkers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwing_Muses">Throwing Muses</a> has announced that its new EP, <a href="http://www.50footwave.com/freemusic/"><i>Free Music</i></a> is available for -- you guessed it -- <i>free</i> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed-music">Creative Commons Music Sharing License.</a> Right on, 50 Foot Wave!</p>
<blockquote><p>With "Free Music" 50FootWave is seeking new earballs. We thought it'd be interesting to ask for your energy & enthusiasm rather than your money and see what happens. To that end, please share this music in any and every way you see fit. Burn CDs, post the mp3s, seed Torrents -- whatever's comfortable for you.</p></blockquote>
