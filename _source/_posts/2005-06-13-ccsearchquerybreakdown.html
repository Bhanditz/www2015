<p>In March we posted a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5311">CC search index breakdown</a> showing what license properties publishers have chosen to use, based on content crawled for our <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org">search engine</a>.</p>
<p>The following table has corresponding numbers for search engine queries.  Given a format-specific query, what percentage of users limit results to works that may be used commercially, to make derivative works, or both?</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Wants commercial use</th>
<th>Wants derivative works</th>
<th>Wants both</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Audio</th>
<td>32</td>
<td>38</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Image</th>
<td>39</td>
<td>41</td>
<td>27</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Interactive</th>
<td>34</td>
<td>43</td>
<td>26</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Text</th>
<td>37</td>
<td>41</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Video</th>
<td>25</td>
<td>32</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>All</th>
<td>43</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>38</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>"All" above includes searches that do not specify a format (63% of searches). Such searchers seem to be more interested in commercial use and derivative works permissions than people searching for a specific format. People searching for video content appear least interested in both permissions. Interestingly this roughly mirrors rights granted by creators: in the aforementioned <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5311">search index breakdown</a> licensors of video content appeared to opt for less liberal licenses than licensors of other content.</p>
