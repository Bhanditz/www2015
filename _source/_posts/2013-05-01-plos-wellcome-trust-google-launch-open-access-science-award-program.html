<p>Today the Public Library of Science announced the <a href="http://asap.plos.org/">Accelerating Science Award Program</a> (ASAP). The award program seeks nominations of individuals who have used, applied, or remixed scientific research -- published through open access -- in order to realize innovations in science, medicine, and technology. The goal of ASAP is to build awareness of and encourage the use of scientific research published through open access. Major sponsors include the Wellcome Trust and Google.</p>
<p>Three winners will each receive $30,000. The nomination period opens today and runs through June 15, 2013. Potential nominees may include individuals, teams, or groups of collaborators -â€“ such as scientists, researchers, educators, social services, technology leaders, entrepreneurs, policy makers, patient advocates, public health workers, and students -â€“ who have used scientific research in transformative ways. The winners will be announced in Washington, DC, in October 2013 at an Open Access Week event hosted by SPARC and the World Bank.  </p>
