<p><em><a href="http://www.participatorymuseum.org/">The Participatory Museum</a></em>, a new book from Nina Simon on ways to increase audience participation in cultural institutions, is now available in full under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want everyone to be able to use the content and make derivative works. I didn't choose Share Alike because I know that many museums, universities, and organizations are not able to use CC licenses (and thus would not be able to redistribute the content). But I did choose Noncommercial because I don't want a publisher to snap up the book or a chapter, credit me as author, and sell the content.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book contains an incredible amount of useful and thought-provoking information for those working in museums and other cultural institutions. Outside of the book itself, Simon posted on the process of self-publishing - including a deeper look at her license choice - on her <a href="http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2010/04/participatory-museum-process-part-4.html">Museum 2.0 blog</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its <a href="http://www.participatorymuseum.org/read/">free release</a> online, <em>The Participatory Museum</em> is available <a href="http://www.participatorymuseum.org/buy/">for purchase</a> as both paperback and PDF download.</p>
