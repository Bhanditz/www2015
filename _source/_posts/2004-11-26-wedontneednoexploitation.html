<blockquote>A group of former pupils at a London comprehensive school are poised to win thousands of pounds in unpaid royalties for singing on Pink Floyd's classic Another Brick In The Wall 25 years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.thisislondon.com/news/articles/14980155?source=Evening%20Standard">great story</a>.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the guy who screams "<a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=19">How can yew have any pudding if you haven't eaten yer meat?</a>" bringing the next lawsuit. (If for no other reason, I bet he's a really interesting-looking bloke 25 years later.)</p>
