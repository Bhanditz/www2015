<p>Creative Commons' localization efforts in Russia over the past years have met with an array of challenges. As CC Ambassador to the Russian Federation Syb Groeneveld can attest, identifying the right team and generating local support was a major task in itself. Fortunately, Syb's efforts over the past months are bearing fruit. Following a partnership with Steiner, Neyman &amp; Partners, which concluded in August 2009, Creative Commons is pleased to announce a qualified new affiliate institution for CC Russia, the <a href="http://www.iis.ru/en/index.html">Institute of the Information Society</a> (IIS).</p>
<p>The first steps with IIS are most promising, although a lot of work awaits the newly-founded CC Russia team. Critically, several laws may have to be amended in the nation's legislation in order for the licenses to be ported in the first place.</p>
<p>To this end, CC Russia is organizing an important<a href="http://www.iis.ru/en/content/view/442/91/"> conference to consult with Russian stakeholders</a> about the challenges ahead for CC in their country and the steps necessary to begin porting. Lawrence Lessig, founder of Creative Commons, will speak at this milestone gathering, which is co-organized by IIS, the Institute of Contemporary Development, Lomonosov Moscow State University and Creative Commons and will be held under the auspices of the Council for the Development of the Information Society under the President of the Russian Federation<a href="http://www.iis.ru/en/content/view/432/91/">.</a></p>
<p>Leading up to the meeting on May 17-18, CC Russia will produce a translation of the CC BY-NC-SA license, which will be available for public discussion. Together with the translation, the team will produce a list of amendments to the Civil Code Part IV deemed necessary to introduce the CC license in Russia. Experienced Russian lawyers, Elena Voinikanis (Associate Professor of Lomonosov Moscow State University) and Mikhail Yakushev (Head of Legal Programs Directorate, IIS), will lead this efforts, with the support of CC Russia Project Manager Louisa Rizmanova and Project Advisor Syb Groeneveld.</p>
<p>The public discussion of the Russian translation will receive support from various local communities, including the local Wikimedia chapter, Mozilla, and LiveJournal. Keep an eye on this blog and <a href="http://www.creativecommons.ru/">www.creativecommons.ru</a>, which will launch May 17, for updates about the translation. Furthermore, the team will produce a paper drawing upon international best practices highlighting the added value CC provides in specific sectors (government, private sector and civil society) in the Russian Federation. This document and the necessary changes in Civil Code part IV will be discussed with top-level government officials and experts.</p>
<p>We are really looking forward to working with our new colleagues in Russia, home to one of the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/idblog/2009/07/01/the-state-of-the-internet-in-russia/">fastest growing internet populations</a> in the world and <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/03/31/mozillas-q1-2010-analyst-report-state-of-the-internet/">rising adopter of open web tools such as Firefox</a>. Thank you and congratulations, CC Russia!</p>
