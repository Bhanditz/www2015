<p>The Center for Social Media at AU has released a <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/resources/publications/code_of_best_practices_in_fair_use_for_opencourseware1/">Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for OpenCourseWare</a>. From the <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/press/byes_you_can_use_copyrighted_material_in_your_open_courseware_b/">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"OpenCourseWare, the Web-based publication of academic course content launched in 2002 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has been lauded for making college-level courses available to anyone anywhere in the world for free. The movement has expanded to include offerings from some of the nationâ€™s most selective universities including the University of Notre Dame and Yale University...</p>
<p>Now, educational organizations have a guide that simplifies the legalities of using copyrighted materials in open coursewareâ€”<strong>The Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for OpenCourseWare</strong>. The code was developed by experts in media and fair use at American University and a committee of practitioners of open courseware from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, MIT, Tufts University, University of Michigan, University of Notre Dame, and Yale University...</p>
<p>The code aims to help OCW designers at U.S. educational organizations recognize situations to which fair use applies and situations that require they get permission from third-party rights holders."</p></blockquote>
