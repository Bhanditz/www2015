<p>If you haven't been to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> or checked out what great work <a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/en/people/paul/index.html">Paul</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulk/">Keller</a> and <a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl/">CC Netherlands</a> is doing, then I highly recommend you A.) get here when you can by <strong>jet</strong>, or B.) tap into their great projects on the <strong>net</strong>. In particular, I'm referring to the big premiere <a href="http://peach.blender.org/index.php/premiere-big-buck-bunny-today/">2nd Annual Blender Peach Open Movie</a>  in Amsterdam last night. I had the great honor of speaking before the premiere which actually felt more like a warm-up gig &mdash; I took it on myself to get people pumped up for the film (laughing, chanting, etc). You can also see my <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2520449/Blender-Open-Movie-Premiere-and-Making-Open-Sustainable">slides here</a> which debut a new style using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/sharing_creative_works">CC Sharing Creative Works Comics</a> (which you may <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2227656/creativecommonssharingcreativeworkseng">download now</a> and translate, just as CC Netherlands has done and made availabe in a booklet here).</p>
<p>And finally, I spoke on a panel today called "Commons-based Peer Production" at the <a href="http://ecommons.eu">Economies of the Commons conference</a> put on by CC Netherlands and others:</p>
<blockquote><p>Strategies for Sustainable Access and Creative Reuse of Images and Sounds Online</p>
<p>International Working Conference<br />
Amsterdam & Hilversum 10, 11 & 12 April 2008</p>
<p>This dossier documents and brings together background materials for the international conference Economies of the Commons. This public working conference and its side programs address the remarkable cultural, educational and societal significance of the new types of audiovisual commons resources that are currently being created on the internet. Sustainable public access and enhanced opportunities for creative reuse of these resources are the particular focus of this conference and this web dossier.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My panel and fellow panelists are described below:</p>
<p><a href="http://research.imagesforthefuture.org/live-stream-and-blogs-economies-of-the-commons/">described below</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After the lunch we continue with the second session about <em>Commons-based Peer Production</em>. How do new developments of creative reuse hold out against market-based production? With Felix Stalder (<a href="http://www.openflows.org/">Open Flows</a>), Jamie King (<a href="http://www.stealthisfilm.com/Part2/">Steal This Film</a>), Jon Phillips (<a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl/">Creative Commons</a>) en Sebastian LÃƒÅ’tgert (<a href="http://www.oil21.org">oil21.org</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The panel came down to Ton Rosendaal from <a href="http://blender.org">Blender Foundation</a> describing his model for sustainability for Open film projects (something you will hear me describe in more depth coming soon) and Jamie King's promise for creating a better voluntary donation system. I took the position as the <strong>realist</strong>  on the panel to reel in the gradient between what commercial entities are presently doing to sustain content distribution (and production in some instances) with the approaches outlined to provide a path of realidad ;)</p>
