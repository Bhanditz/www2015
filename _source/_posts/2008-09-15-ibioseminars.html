<p>This month, the American Society of Cell Biology's <a href="http://www.ascb.org/ibioseminars/">iBioSeminars</a> added twelve new seminars to its original repertoire of twenty. The new seminars explore in depth topics such as "Odorant and Pheromone Signaling" and "Telomeres, Aging, and Cancer." If you didn't know already, iBioSeminars is the ASCB's web seminar series featuring world-class scientists' "on-going research in leading laboratories".</p>
<p>Ron Vale and Bruce Alberts, two professors in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology<br />
and Biochemistry at UCSF, write:</p>
<p>"<em>On behalf of the American Society of Cell Biology, we would like to welcome you to view our exciting iBioSeminars web seminar series, featuring 12 new seminars from world-class scientists. Our mission is to provide free-of-charge seminars from leaders in the life sciences to students and researchers throughout the world. iBioSeminars highlight recent research from leading laboratories but also contain more extensive introductions than are typical of university seminars. iBioSeminars are thus accessible to advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students as well as to researchers who wish to learn about fields outside of their expertise. These free, â€œon-demandâ€ seminars can be downloaded and viewed on a computer, an iPod or an iPhone, allowing you to view them anywhere â€“ at work, at home, on a train, or in a classroom.</em>"</p>
<p>The ASCB <a href="http://www.ascb.org/ibioseminars/about.cfm">plans</a> on adding twenty new seminars each year, hopefully even making foreign language translations so that they will be even more globally accessible. iBioSeminars is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>.</p>
