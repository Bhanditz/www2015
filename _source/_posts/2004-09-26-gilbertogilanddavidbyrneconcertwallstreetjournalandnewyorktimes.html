<p>Fuller re-caps of the New York WIRED + Creative Commons concert with Gilberto Gil and David Byrne are on the way. (We've all just arrived back home after a very hectic and great week in the Big Apple.) For now, check out a couple of choice press accounts from the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB109563044896921709,00.html?mod=todays_free_feature<br />
">Wall Street Journal</a> and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/25/arts/music/25BYRNE.html">New York Times</a> (reg. required).</p>
<p>As soon as we have reprint rights to these stories, you'll find them here.</p>
