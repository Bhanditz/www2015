<p>A couple weeks old, but worth reading: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/30/science-fiction-writ-1.html">Cory Doctorow excoriates Science Fiction Writers of America</a> for issuing takedowns on his behalf, without his permission, against sites hosting his books, with permission (under CC licenses).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cory blogs about <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/05/proceduralcodeasmagi.html">another author's science fantasy trilogy released under a CC license</a> and is writing a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/04/locus-column-on-the.html">column in Locus magazine on why SF writers should use CC</a>.</p>
<p>One of the blog reactions to Cory's SFWA kerfuffle <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/08/letting_crazy_p.html">Letting Crazy People Set Intellectual-Property Policy</a> (citing other recent examples of "craziness" as well). Of course with Creative Commons you can <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">set your own non-crazy policy</a>. That's not science fiction.</p>
