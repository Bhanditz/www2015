<p>We're proud to announce that Roger McGuinn, author of the ethereal sounds of legendary rock band <a href="http://www.lyon.edu/webdata/users/kadler/public_html/rmcguinn/">The Byrds</a>, has licensed dozens of musical recordings with Creative Commons licenses.  </p>
<p>McGuinn has long been a leading champion of the American folk music tradition.  At his <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jimmy/folkden/">Folk Den</a>, McGuinn publishes his own versions of traditional tunes, using the Web to celebrate "the tradition of the folk process, that is the telling of stories, and singing of songs, passed on from one generation to another by word of mouth." </p>
<p>McGuinn is the latest in a line of prominent creators who have decided to apply Creative Commons licenses to their work.   <a href="http://djspooky.com">DJ Spooky</a>, That Subliminal Kid, has licensed a short film; multimedia collagist People Like Us (a.k.a. Vicki Bennett) will license a number of her songs; and the <a href="http://cnx.rice.edu">Connexions Project</a> at <a href="http://www.rice.edu">Rice University</a> has published all of their online course materials with our licenses.  Browse our <a href="/works/">Featured Works</a> to find information about these and other excellent works.</p>
