<p>Back in December, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7894">we blogged</a> about <a href="http://lingro.com/">Lingro</a>, a project <a href="http://lingro.com/docs/about.html">that aims</a> â€œto create an on-line environment that allows anyone learning a language to quickly look up and learn the vocabulary most important to themâ€. Lingro pools the open-content community for their definitions (including CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">BY-SA licensed</a> user submissions), ingraining it in a cycle of sharing and reuse with future promise of dynamic growth.</p>
<p>Since then, Lingro has added <a href="http://lingro.com/builder/">CC </a><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">BY-SA licensed</a>, multi-lingual, dictionaries that prompt users with a list of words missing from a particular dictionary and let them enter translations. These dictionaries are <a href="http://lingro.com/docs/webmaster-tools.html#contributor">also available in widget form</a>, allowing webmasters to add Lingro functionality to their websites (users can add definitions without going to Lingro directly). In addition to this, Lingro has added translations of their site into French, Spanish, German, Italian and Polish, as well as a Swedish dictionary (which translates back and forth between all the other languages on Lingro). With these developments, Lingro continues to make amazing strides in fostering information sharing that has immense potential in relation to language education and cross-cultural communication.</p>
