MIT's <a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/">The Tech</a> newspaper recently sat down with Motion Picture Association of America head Jack Valenti <a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V124/N20/ValentiIntervie.20f.html">for an interview about digital rights</a>. The writer, a MIT engineering student, probes (perhaps a bit too tenaciously) the bad side of the DMCA, namely DVD encryption and playback on Linux, which is currently illegal. In the end it's a nice short piece on two opposing viewpoints coming together and trying to see each other's point of view, something that's often lacking in digital rights debates.</p>
