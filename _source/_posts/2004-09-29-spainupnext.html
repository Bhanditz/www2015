There is no end in sight, as yet.</p>
<p>
In Barcelona, on Friday, Creative Commons will launch its Spanish licenses. Ignasi Labastida i Juan, the Spanish project lead, has organized a promising launch event that will feature, amongst other speakers, Mr. Oriol Ferran i Riera, General Secretary of Telecommunications and the Information Society, Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalan Government), and a round table on "New ways of publishing and publicizing culture". Roland is going to give a talk on iCommons, while Christiane is busy proselytizing in England. </p>
<p>
It will all happen in Barcelona, at the Aula Magna of the Universitat de Barcelona (UB), Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes 585, Spain, on Friday at 10am. All readers of this blog are welcome to attend and contribute to the discussion.</p></p>
