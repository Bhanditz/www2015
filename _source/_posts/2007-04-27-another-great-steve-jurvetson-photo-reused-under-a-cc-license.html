<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jurvetson">Steve Jurvetson</a> let us know about a very cool recent reuse of one of his CC-licensed photos. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/70704300">This</a> incredible macro shot of an ant was used to accompany an <a href="http://pub.ucsf.edu/today/cache/feature/200704205.html">article</a> on UCSF's website about chitin and allergic inflammation.</p>

<p>Jurvetson's photography has been used under CC licenses many times in print and on TV. As he says in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/470406451/">discussion</a> about Creative Commons on Flickr:</p>
<blockquote><p>I use a simple attribution license which for me is just perfect. It maximizes the freedom for reuse while maintaining a channel for attention back to this photoblog.</p>
<p>And it really works. I never imagined that my photos would be used by anyone, and certainly not in the unusual places that they have so far... including: Maxim Magazine, Science magazine, on TV with the Charlie Rose Show, the cover of a board game, and numerous textbooks, even one for the blind (go figure!)... Here are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/sets/72157594313529657">some examples</a>.</p></blockquote>
