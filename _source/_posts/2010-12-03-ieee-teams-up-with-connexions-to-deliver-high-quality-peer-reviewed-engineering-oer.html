<p>Rice University's <a href="http://cnx.org/">Connexions</a> and the <a href="http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Signal Process Society</a> (IEEE-SPS) <a href="http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=15110">recently announced</a> the release of a set of open educational resources on signal processing. The materials allow engineering instructors to mix and match to build customized courses, textbooks and study guides, and are useful for practicing engineers for their own education and career growth. The high-quality resources are peer-reviewed and available for free on the <a href="http://cnx.org/lenses/ieeesps/endorsements">Connexions IEEE-SPS portal</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=15110">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the open-education movement has grown rapidly in recent years, critics have questioned how open-access publishers can ensure the quality of freely authored and edited materials. An oft-proposed option is adapting peer review -- the process academic researchers have used for centuries to vet and certify research papers and books.</p>
<p>"All materials must pass thorough a rigorous quality evaluation before they appear on the IEEE Signal Processing Society's branded portal in Connexions," said Roxana Saint-Nom, chair of the society's Connexions Lens Subcommittee.</p></blockquote>
<p>This collaboration is one of the first between a major professional society and an open educational resource provider.Â Connexions is one of the largestÂ repositories of OER in the world, and all its materials are available under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license.Â <a href="http://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> is the world's largest technical professional organization, with over 395,000 members.</p>
