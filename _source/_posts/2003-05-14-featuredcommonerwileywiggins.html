<p>Check out a new <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/features/wiggins">interview</a> with actor, animator, author, and Austinite Wiley Wiggins, by our own Matt Haughey. You may remember Wiggins' star turns in Richard Linklater's films <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0106677">Dazed and Confused</a></em> and <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0243017">Waking Life</a></em>.  But if you're really in, you recognize him as a friendly <a href="http://www.wileywiggins.com/blog.html">blogger</a> and all-around <a href="http://www.wileywiggins.com">web dude</a>.</p>
