<p>Seven months ago we noted that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7784">LibriVox released their 1,000th public domain audio book</a>. Now they've <a href="http://hughmcguire.net/2008/06/02/librivox-115-and-1500/">reached 1,500</a>. That's over 70 audio books released each month, and things are picking up -- they released 115 in May.</p>
<p><a href="http://librivox.org/">Check out LibriVox</a>, perhaps the most interesting collaborative culture project this side of Wikipedia -- and everything on LibriVox is in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">public domain</a>, free for any use, without restriction.</p>
<p>LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire recently posted an <a href="http://hughmcguire.net/2008/03/31/why-public-domain-and-not-creative-commons/">explanation of why LibriVox audio books are dedicated to the public domain rather than released under a CC license</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So LibriVox is a small beacon of light in this policy question, slowly adding to the public domain while all around the public domain is shrinking. this is important in some broad sense beyond anything particular we do at librivox. at least I think it is.</p></blockquote>
<p>The whole essay is well worth reading.</p>
