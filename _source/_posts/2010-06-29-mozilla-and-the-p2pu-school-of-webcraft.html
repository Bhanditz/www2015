<p>In September, Mozilla and P2PU are launching the <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/p2pu-webcraft">P2PU School of Webcraft</a>, and they invite you to participate. The partnership leverages Mozilla's experience and the P2PU community to create a social learning environment for those who want to "learn the craft of open and standards-based web development." The P2PU School of Webcraft is a set of courses centered on the open web, including "Introduction to HTML5" and "Building Social with the Open Web." From the <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/content/p2pu-school-webcraft-call-course-organizers">call for proposals</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Following on the delivery model developed by P2PU, course organizers volunteer to take existing open learning materials or develop their own content and lead a group of peers through 6 weeks of online classes. Courses focus on project based learning in a peer environment and are proposed, created and led by members of the web development community â€“ so the content will always be up to date with the latest technologies.</p>
<p>We'd love for you to become a part of this project and until July 18 we're inviting course proposals for P2PU School of Webcraft. We've made it really easy to get started, just fill out the proposal form, it takes less than 5 minutes!</p></blockquote>
<p>The school is completely free and open, with all P2PU produced material licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>---which means anyone can build on the courses and run their own. But anyone can also get involved with P2PU by <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdtSFFDeUM3MzBVTzhBd2E4anRwU0E6MQ">proposing</a> a course or <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dG0waTVHcnZkZ2gyTnJTVXJBbHJub0E6MQ">participating</a> in one, or just <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/project/p2p-university-open-web-career-track">learning more</a>.
