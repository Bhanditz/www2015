<p>For <a href="http://digg.com">Digg.com</a>'s fourth <a href="http://digg.com/dialogg/">Digg Dialogg</a>, Kevin Rose <a href="http://digg.com/dialogg/Trent_Reznor">interviews</a> NIN's front man <a href="http://enwp.org/Trent Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> with questions submitted by the Digg community. Not surprisingly, <a href="http://digg.com/dialogg/Trent_Reznor?t=24532733#c24532733">the top rated question</a> refers to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8095">NIN's choice to use Creative Commons licenses</a> when releasing his two recent albums. One of those albums, <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com">Ghosts I-IV</a>, topped Amazon MP3 as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11947">the best selling album of 2008</a>. </p>

<p>NIN's experiments in music publishing were not accidents. In the interview, the soft-spoken Reznor carefully articulates the reasoning for his new forays as well as his advice for up-and-coming artists. NIN has a huge fan base and a lot at stake here; these are not academic rants with no practical interests at stake, but rather the actual beliefs of a working, career musician whose career depends on their success. If you watch one interview about the future of music, <a href="http://digg.com/dialogg/Trent_Reznor">this should be it</a>.</p>
