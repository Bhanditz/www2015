<p>The powerful new film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/"><em>Children of Men</em></a> is notable for many things: its bleak artistry, riveting story, and elegant direction, just to name a few. A very cool aspect of the movie that <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/children_of_men/">the critics</a> may not have much appreciation for, but that we here at Creative Commons surely do, is its use of a CC-licensed audio sample, taken from the excellent CC community sound library <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/">Freesound</a>.</p>
<p>From Freesound:</p>
<blockquote><p>Friendly freesounder "6am" just brought it to my attention that the major motion picture <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/">Children of Men</a></em> uses a Freesound sample, and properly credits the sample! You can see for yourself from <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/files/children_of_men.jpg">this image</a> that was sent to me. The sound in question is the <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/samplesViewSingle.php?id=9432">"male loud scream"</a> from <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/usersViewSingle.php?id=13258">thanvannispen</a>. This is quite an amazing first! Go go freesound power!! And congratulations thanvannispen.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sample is licensed to the public under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/">Sampling Plus</a>, making this a really great example of how CC's non-exclusive noncommercial licenses can easily work in tandem with separate commercial licensing arrangements. Nice going to everyone involved!</p>
