<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Jones">Pamela Jones</a> is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/groklaw">December's Featured Commoner</a>. Jones is the founder and editor of <a href="http://groklaw.net/">Groklaw</a>, an award-winning Web site that conducts complex legal research using an approach inspired by open source. What started out as a one-woman operation in 2003 has grown to a full-fledged community with hundreds of contributors and millions of daily visitors. We recently spoke with Jones about her site's origins and how applying a Creative Commons license to her articles has helped her promote her work.
