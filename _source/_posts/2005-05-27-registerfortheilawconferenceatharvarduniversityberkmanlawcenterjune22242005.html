<p>Cambridge, Mass. will be the site for this year's Internet Law Program. Our very own Lawrence Lessig, CC Chairman and CEO, will be one of several notable professors and scholars of the Internet who will be lecturing on the ever-developing landscape of Internet law. No prior background in the subject of Internet Law is required; however, American lawyers may be eligible for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credit. To register and/or download a program brochure please visit the Berkman Center website <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ilaw/home">here</a><a /></p>
