<p>This week's featured content is Philadelphia-area rock band <a href="http://www.phoenixtrap.com/">The Phoenix Trap</a>. All their songs at MP3.com are available under a Creative Commons license (which also has streaming versions). Fans can purchase <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/phoenixtrap">a CD of their full set of songs as well</a>. "Not Me" and "You're on Fire" were definitely my favorites.</p>
