<p>Creative Commons and the makers of the independent film currently in production <em>RIP: A Remixer's Manifesto</em> a co-production between Montreal-based production house <a href="http://www.eyesteelfilm.com">Eye Steel Film</a> and the <a href="http://www.nfb.ca">National Film Board of Canada</a> are making a <a href="http://ccmixter.org/rip">Call for Soundtracks</a>.    The film itself is released under a CC license and has been produced collaboratively through hundreds of submissions and remixes at <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org">Open Source Cinema</a>. </p>
<p>A mashup in its own right, RIP tackles the issue of Fair Use â”€ broadly defined as the limited use of copyrighted material without requiring the permission of the rights holders â”€ on its own uncertain ground. Pulling footage from a range of sources, filmmaker Brett Gaylor looks at cultural appropriation throughout history, from Muddy Waters to the Rolling Stones to the king of the remix, Walt Disney. With legal advice from Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig, Brett negotiates the tricky world of fair-use filmmaking.</p>
<p>Now the producers and CC are using <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> to host a Call for Soundtracks hoping to finish the music soundtrack for the film using remixes made from CC Attribution licensed source material. Instructions and details can be <a href="http://ccmixter.org/rip">found at ccMixter</a>.</p>
