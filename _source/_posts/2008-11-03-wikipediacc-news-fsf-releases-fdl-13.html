<p>The Free Software Foundation has just released <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html">version 1.3 of its Free Documentation License</a> containing language which <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html">allows FDL-licensed wikis</a> to republish FDL content under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC Attribution-ShareAlike license</a> until August 1, 2009. Excepted from this are FDL documents originating elsewhere unless they have been incorporated into the wiki prior to November 1, 2008.</p>
<p>This is a crucial step toward de-fracturing the free (culture) as in (software) freedom world, which should have the impact of greatly accelerating the growth of that world. Last December the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7876">Wikimedia Foundation requested that the FSF make this step</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks and congratulations to the WMF and FSF (if you haven't wished the latter a hearty 25th anniversary yet, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9112">please do so</a>) and to the free world.</p>
<p>The next step is for the Wikipedia/Wikimedia community (and other FDL-licensed wikis) to decide to offer wiki content under CC BY-SA 3.0.</p>
<p>We hope that these communities find CC the best steward for free culture licenses to be relied upon for massively collaborative works. See our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8213">Statement of Intent for Attribution-ShareAlike Licenses</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051">Approved for Free Cultural Works branding</a> rolled out in February and April of this year respectively for some background on this.</p>
<p>In the longer term (i.e., in a future version of the CC BY-SA license, which as the FSF does their licenses, we version very carefully and deliberately) we will address other issues of particular interest to communities creating massively collaborative works, in particular attribution for such situations (our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5457">version 2.5</a> licenses begin to do this) and how strongly copyleft (ShareAlike in CC parlance) attaches to the context in which CC BY-SA licensed images are used (as we did for video synced to music in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216">version 2.0</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks again to the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/associate/support_freedom/donate/index_html">FSF</a> and <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Donate">WMF</a>, which as CC does, build critical infrastructure for a free world. All of these organizations are nonprofits deserving of your support. CC is running its <a href="http://support.creativecommoins.org/join">annual fundraising campaign</a> right now. :)</p>
