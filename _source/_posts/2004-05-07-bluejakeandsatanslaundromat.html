<p>If you're looking for slice-of-life New York City photographs of the compelling and off-beat, the images at <a href="http://www.bluejake.com/">Bluejake</a> and <a href="http://www.satanslaundromat.com/sl/">Satan's Laundromat</a> have got you covered. They're both licensed under Creative Commons and allow for derivative works, making for some great collage fodder.</p>
