<p>Finally the announcement you've all been waiting for - the Creative Commons Global Summit 2013 will be held from 21 to 24 August in beautiful Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
<p>This biannual gathering of CC friends and family will be co-hosted by our local Creative Commons affiliates, <a href="http://www.vialibre.org.ar/">FundaciÃ³n VÃ­a Libre</a> and <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org.ar/">Wikimedia Argentina</a> and will take place at the <a href="http://www.centroculturalsanmartin.com/">San MartÃ­n Cultural Center</a>. We're particularly excited by the choice of Buenos Aires as the host city - not only because it is a world-renowned cultural hub and the home to some fabulous open access projects, but also because this is the first time our global community will meet in a Spanish-speaking country. </p>
<p>The event will bring together Creative Commons affiliates from the around the world with the CC board, its staff, key stakeholders, local representatives, and others interested in the present and future of the commons. Attendees will discuss strategies to strengthen Creative Commons and its worldwide community, learn about the latest developments in the commons movement worldwide, and showcase local and international projects that use Creative Commons licenses. Topics covered will include the implementation of open policies in areas such as government, education, culture, business, science, data, and more, as well as related topics such as free software, license development, collecting societies, and copyright advocacy. Watch for a call for papers/workshops/events soon.</p>
<p>The event is free for all attendees, although registration is required, and will include a Spanish-language stream to highlight the expertise of the local community. You can find out more information at our wiki site <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2013">here</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to see you in Buenos Aires in August.</p>
