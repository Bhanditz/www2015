<p>Jonathan Bailey at <a href="http://plagiarismtoday.com">PlagiarismToday</a> has <a href="http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2009/05/28/why-to-not-write-your-own-license/">a great post dissecting the various issues</a> raised by the bizarre "<a href="http://copyrightedblog.blogspot.com/">WE ARE COPYRIGHTED BLOGS</a>" license he recently came across. Jonathan <a href="http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2009/05/28/why-to-not-write-your-own-license/">correctly recommends that you leave it to the professionals (Creative Commons is a good example :) to draft your copyright licenses</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This license displays some of the many hazards that people face when they try to craft their own copyright licenses. This is why, whenever possible, you should either use an â€œAll Rights Reservedâ€ license and grant permissions on a case-by-case basis, use a Creative Commons or other license that has been vetted and written by professionals or [an]other license that has been vetted and written by professionals.</p></blockquote>
<p>And remember kids, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation">just say NO to license proliferation</a>.</p>
