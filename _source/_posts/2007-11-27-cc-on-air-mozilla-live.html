<p><a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node/28817">Tune in this Wednesday</a>, November 28, from 14:00:00 - 15:30:00 PST (UTC -8.) to listen to the relaunch of <a href="http://air.mozilla.com/">Air Mozilla Live</a>, the "Internet multimedia presence of Mozilla". The broadcast will feature CC's Development Coordinator <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#64">Melissa Reeder</a>, who will be talking about CC as an organization, what we do, and the significance of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7855">upcoming 5th anniversary</a>. Air Mozilla is a community call-in show, so prepare for questions and a lively discussion. Here is the info (from <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node/28817">Mozilla</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Who: The Mozilla community, host Asa Dotzler, and guests Melissa Reeder, Mark Finkle, Dave Townsend, and Christian Sejersen.<br />
When: Wednesday, November 28, from 14:00:00 - 15:30:00 PST (UTC -8.)<br />
Where: View the webcast at air.mozilla.com and participate on IRC, IM, or email.</p>
<p>    * IRC: join the discussion on irc.mozilla.org #airmozilla<br />
    * IM: instant message your questions to the AIM/YIM/GTalk screenname airmozilla.<br />
    * email: send in your questions before and during the show to airmozilla@mozilla.com. </p>
<p>Air Mozilla is now streaming 24/7 with a new live show every month (or as close to that as makes sense.) If you've got ideas for shows, please email us and let us know. Even better, if you're a part of the Mozilla community and you'd like to be interviewed or present on our live broadcast, let us know.</p></blockquote>
<p>For anyone looking to get a better picture of what we have been up to lately and what we are hoping to accomplish in the future, this is a must listen!</p>
