<p>Today's a big day for annoucements at Creative Commons. Earlier today in Tokyo, Japan, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3920">the launch date of iCommons Japan was finalized</a> and we have turned on automatic Japanese translation for our current license system. Starting next month, we will be offering optional licenses that apply to laws within the Japanese jurisdiction</p>
<p>Even bigger news is that the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3919">Brazilian government has commited to releasing code created with public funding as free software using the new CC-GPL</a>, or Creative Commons Gnu General Public License. The CC-GPL will improve upon the existing GPL by adding in our interface of Commons Deeds and embedded metadata. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/cc-gpl-br">The CC-GPL page</a> is now offered from our license page, in Brazilian Portugese only for now, but soon will also be available in English.</p>
