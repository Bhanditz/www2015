<p>WIRED magazine today announced that rock band Spoon will headline a concert to benefit Creative Commons on September 10, 2007 at the Henry Fonda Theater in Los Angeles. The concert is a kick-off event for WIRED NextFest, a unique worldâ€™s-fair-style event showcasing future technologies in design, entertainment, communication, healthcare, transportation, sustainable living, and more, at the Los Angeles Convention Center, September 13â€“16, 2007.</p>
<p>Spoon is an Austin, TX-based quartet with five full-length albums to its credit, and its heavily anticipated sixth album, entitled â€œGa Ga Ga Ga Gaâ€ is slated for release on July 10. Spoonâ€™s previous album, â€œGimme Fiction,â€ received widespread acclaim and appeared on â€œBest of 2005â€ lists in Blender and Spin. In 2004, Spoon joined artists such as the Beastie Boys, David Byrne, My Morning Jacket, a pre-Gnarls-Barkley Danger Mouse (featuring Cee-Lo), and the Rapture in donating tracks to the Creative Commons-licensed WIRED CD: Rip. Sample. Mash. Share.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the concert will benefit Creative Commons, the non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative work available for others to build upon and share legally. This is the third benefit concert WIRED has produced to benefit Creative Commons. Previous concerts featured David Byrne and Gilberto Gil; and Girl Talk, Diplo and Peeping Tom.</p>
<p>The concert will serve as a live reunion for Spoon and Keepon the robot, which achieved online celebrity status in April after the little robot became a YouTube sensation dancing to Spoonâ€™s song, â€œI Turn My Camera On.â€ The video â€œKeepon Dancing to Spoonâ€ is available on YouTube at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g-yrjh58ms">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g-yrjh58ms</a> and boasts over 1.2 million views and scores of online imitators. Following the concert, Keepon will be holding court at WIRED NextFest September 13-16.</p>
<p>Tickets go on sale Saturday, June 23, for the all-ages general admission show priced at $20.  Tickets are available through Ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p>In addition to enjoying Spoonâ€™s critically acclaimed music and supporting an important cause in Creative Commons, concertgoers will get a sneak peek at some of the futuristic exhibits to be showcased at WIRED NextFest. Attendees of the benefit concert will get a free ticket to WIRED NextFest for Friday, September 14.</p>
