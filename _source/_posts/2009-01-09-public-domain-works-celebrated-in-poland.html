<p>It's after Three Kings Day, and after battling inboxes, CCi is back online and blogging. From our colleagues in <a href="http://creativecommons.pl/">CC Poland</a>, some <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11920">more</a> exciting <a href="http://www.xanga.com/publicdomain/687985634/public-domain-day-2009.html">Public Domain Day</a> news to ring in the New Year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poland's Coalition for Open Education (<a href="http://koed.org.pl">KOED - Koalicja Otwartej Edukacji</a>) has celebrated the Public Domain Day 2009 with a range of web-based actions and a press conference.</p>
<p>The Polish National Library, with the support of its director, dr. Tomasz Makowski, hosted talks about the public domain and related Polish projects at a press conference on Dec. 30. BoÅ¼ena Michalska from the Nicolaus Copernicus University Library presented a list of over 500 authors whose works entered the public domain in Poland on 1st January 2009, based on the <a href="http://www.nukat.edu.pl/nukat/en/index.html">National Union Catalog NUKAT</a>. Afterwards, Marek Siudym, a renowned Polish actor, recited a poem by Brunon JasieÅ„ski - a Polish futurist, who died in 1938 and who's work is now in the public domain.</p>
<p>As a result of the well-attended conference, news of the Public Domain Day 2009 was published in a range of major media, including Gazeta Wyborcza and Rzeczpospolita dailies, Polish Public Radio, and the online portal Onet.</p>
<p>To coincide with the Public Domain Day 2009, Polish libraries have made available over a dozen works in their digital collections that are, as of January 1st 2009, in the public domain in Poland. A list of Polish works now in the public domain is maintained on the <a href="http://koed.org.pl/?p=45">Coalition's webpage</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The newly forged partnership, KOED, is striving to build and promote open educational resources in Poland. Bringing together common supporters of the Capetown Declaration principles, the Coalition is formed by one of CC Poland's affiliate institutions, the <a href="http://www.icm.edu.pl">Interdisciplinary Center for Modelling at University of Warsaw</a>, and colleagues <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stowarzyszenie_Wikimedia_Polska">Wikimedia Polska Association</a>, <a href="http://www.nowoczesnapolska.org.pl/">Foundation Modern Poland</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ebib.info/">Polish Librarians Association</a>.</p>
