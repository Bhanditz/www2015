<p>As I <s>procrastinate</s>finish my slides for a talk on <a href="http://semantic-conference.com/program/sessions/F4.html">Semantic Search on the Public Web with Creative Commons</a> at the <a href="http://www.semantic-conference.com/">2006 Semantic Technology Conference</a> (March 6-9, San Jose, California) I note that the <a href="http://semantic-conference.com/program/sessions/U1.html">closing keynote</a> makes some pretty heady predictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Markets for semantic technology products and services will grow 10-fold from 2006 to 2010 to more than $50B worldwide. Near-term drivers include 2-10X gains in performance for information-intensive processes across a broad range of applications and domains. From 2010 to 2020 semantic technology markets will grow ten-fold again, fueling trillion-dollar world-wide economic expansions. Longer-term drivers are new capabilities for knowledge-intensive activities, tasks, and processes that will tap new sources of value, delivering performance gains up to 100-fold.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put that in your pipe and smoke it with <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2004/05/01/368240/index.htm">Giving it Away (for Fun and Profit)</a>, Business 2.0's article claiming Creative Commons could be the key to a new multibillion-dollar industry.  Ponder what would happen if you mashed up these nascent multibillion-dollar industries?  Fortunately some of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#1">forward thinkers</a> who started Creative Commons already thought of that.</p>

<p>Creative Commons board member Hal Abelson and advisor Ben Adida will also be presenting at the conference on <a href="http://semantic-conference.com/program/sessions/M5.html">Interoperable Metadata for a Bottom-Up Semantic Web</a>, as will CC advisor Eric Miller, on <a href="http://semantic-conference.com/program/sessions/M1.html">Recombinant Business</a>, appropriately enough.</p>
<p>If this post gave you a hype headache please go listen to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5716">some</a> <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/tags/chill">chill</a>. You'll get over it.</p>
