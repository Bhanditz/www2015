<p><a href="http://interplast.blogs.com/interplast/2007/04/a_story_of_heal.html">Interplast announced today</a> the release of its 1997 Academy Award winning documentary <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Story_of_Healing">A Story of Healing</a></em> under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/lienses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives</a> license.</p>
<p>Ten years later, this is the first time an Academy Award winning film has been released under a CC license. Kudos to Interplast for realizing that this film, which makes a compelling case for Interplast's work, will become more valuable to the organization as more people have the opportunity to view it.</p>
<p>To view <em>A Story of Healing</em> <a href="http://interplast.org/astoryofhealing.php">visit the Interplast website</a>.  The film is also <a href="http://interplast.blip.tv/file/196797/">downloadable from blip.tv</a>, and wherever you share it!</p>
