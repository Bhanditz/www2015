<p>I just turned on the new version of Creative Commons Web Services.  The new version, 1.5, has lots of new features.  The most important to me as a developer is the test suite -- we can now run automated tests on the server software when we make changes to make sure the services still behave properly.  The most important to users, however, is probably localization.  Just like our <a href="/license">license engine</a> lets users <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=de">select</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=pl">a</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=ja">language</a>, application developers can now choose to show their users a localized interface from the web services.</p>
<p>More details and documentation are available <a href="http://api.creativecommons.org/docs/readme_15.html">here</a>.</p>
