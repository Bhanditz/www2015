<p>While not Creative Commons licensed, we were gratified to hear that a web-only release from <a href="http://www.mariaschneider.com/">Maria Schneider</a> won a Grammy at the recent awards, despite the fact that her CD was only available from <a href="http://www.artistshare.net/">ArtistsDirect</a>, and not in any record store. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=internetNews&storyID=7613511">Reuters has a good wrapup</a> and it's our hope this is the first of many for artists recording, producing, and releasing their music online.</p>
