Ben Rosenbaum</a>, an American science fiction writer and computer programmer, recently released his latest collection of sci-fi shorts, <em><a href="http://lcrw.net/rosenbaum/">The Ant King: and Other Stories</a></em>, as both a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931520534/downandoutint-20">print collection</a> through <a href="http://lcrw.net/index.htm">Small Beer Press</a> and a <a href="http://lcrw.net/cc/index.htm#rosenbaum1">free download</a> under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA license</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Ant King</em> gets a <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/03/ben-rosenbaums-the-a.html">seal of approval</a> from CC evangelist/writer <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> and the excerpts from the collection I have been able to read are magnificent. Rosenbaum is <a href="http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/2008_09.html#000663">encouraging his readers to send in any derivative works</a> they make so that he can post them online. He is simultaneously holding a contest for his three favorite derivative works, whose authors will receive a signed and "extensively doodled-upon" hardcover copy of <em>The Ant King</em>.</p>
