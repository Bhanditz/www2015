<p><em>Many</em> people have written to tell us about the Pew Internet & American Life report on <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/166/report_display.asp">Teen Content Creators and Consumers</a>, which found an astounding 57 percent of online teens in the U.S. create online content and 19 percent are remixers.</p>
<p>The report doesn't mention Creative Commons, though the implications are apparently obvious to our correspondents and many in the media, for example this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4403574.stm">BBC article on the study</a>, which lists Creative Commons as one of two related links (the other being the study itself): <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5622">participatory culture</a> is only just <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5572">getting started</a> and flexible copyright <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">licenses</a> are a necessary part of the equation.</p>
