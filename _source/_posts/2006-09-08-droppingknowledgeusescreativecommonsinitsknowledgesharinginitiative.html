<p><b>San Francisco, USA, Berlin, Germany, September 8, 2006</b></p>
<p>Creative Commons is pleased to announce that <i>dropping knowledge</i>, the not-for-profit initiative that offers a global knowledge portal and dialogue forum on its <a href="http://www.droppingknowledge.org">website</a> will use Creative Commonsâ€™ licenses for its innovative online resource.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2006, 112 creative thinkers, ranging from artists, writers and scientists to philosophers, politicians and activists, will gather in Berlin, Germany, around the worldâ€™s biggest round-table â€” â€œThe Table of Free Voicesâ€ â€” to simultaneously answer 100 of the most pressing questions that have been raised by people from around the world. Their digitally recorded answers will provide the foundation of a new web platform designed to promote dialogue and social change.</p>
<p>In order to make the resulting audiovisual footage in its online resource free to share for everyone, <i>dropping knowledge</i> decided to publish the 11,200 answers under Creative Commons licenses. Users of the <i>dropping knowledge</i> web platform will be able to freely access, share and remix the recorded answers from participants as diverse as filmmaker Wim Wenders, Chinese human rights activist Harry Wu and the Greek evolutionary biologist Elisabet Sahtouris as well as many more inspiring thinkers.</p>
<p>Creative Commonsâ€™ licenses offer a way to legally share and remix content and, consequently, are a logical solution for and enabler of dropping knowledge's philosophy that sharing knowledge is key to a global dialogue.</p>
<p><i>dropping knowledgeâ€™s</i> freely accessible web-platform invites the global public to ask and answer questions, exchange viewpoints and ideas and join in conversation of global social topics. It aims to become a knowledge-resource for individuals, schools, universities, NGOs and the media, as well as socially minded businesses, foundations and organizations the world over.</p>
