<p>The critical and commercial success of <em>Ghosts I-IV</em> from Nine Inch Nails <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11947">continues to amaze</a> ... also see <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nin_creative_commons-licensed.php">Read Write Web</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20090106-free-nine-inch-nails-albums-top-2008-amazon-mp3-sales-charts.html">Ars Technica</a> and <a href="http://digg.com/music/CC_licensed_NINalbum_is_AMZN_s_1_MP3_bestseller_for_2008">Digg</a> for additional comments on the album's breakthrough.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity to celebrate that the world of CC music is amazing for its depth and growth, not only for singular successes. One of many indicators is that Jamendo is on the cusp of reaching 15,000 openly licensed albums. They've put out a <a href="http://blog.jamendo.com/2009/01/05/who-is-in-your-best-of-2008/">call for best of 2008 lists</a>. It turns out fans have been building such lists all year, which is great, as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8518">discovery</a> is the challenge.</p>
<p>My discovered on Jamendo in 2008 list follows. Except for the last track, you probably won't enjoy this much, but that's not the point -- there are lots of other people discovering CC licensed music (at Jamendo and elsewhere) -- <a href="http://blog.jamendo.com/2009/01/05/who-is-in-your-best-of-2008/">follow them and you could be too</a>.  Or, if you share my taste in noise music...<small><br />
<tt><br />
<strong><em>KORIZA</em></strong> (Komitet Operativnoy Razrabotki Industrialnyh Zennostey Avangarda) from Saint Petersburg, Russia. They've released one experimental mathcore single, <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/31243">New Orlean Sunset Club</a></strong> that is deeply satisfying but a little too mellow. They are supposedly working on "new material, that will be much more experimental, vanguard &amp; violent." CAN'T WAIT.</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>Dr Pombo</em></strong>: <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/4641">Trastorno de la personalidad</a></strong> Rock electrÃ³nico psicodÃ©lico from Ermua, Spain. Recommed the track <em>La mano de Dios</em>.</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>Desarraigo</em></strong> of NingÃºnlado (Nowhere), Mexico does very short, violent tracks with a drum machine, screaming, and GNU/Linux. On <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/26137">Polvo</a></strong> recommend <em>Criadero De Polvo</em>, which adds night sounds, a 46 second epic.</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>En Busca Del Pasto</em></strong>, an improvisational project from Madrid, Spain, has released 24 albums on Jamendo. <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/35896">ImprovisaciÃ³n para dÃºo, NÂº 4 (Â«Pan y vinoÂ»)</a></strong> is heavier on electronics and sampling than typical for EBDP. <em>Parte segunda</em> from that album is excellent.</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>Daniele Torelli</em></strong> of Reggio Emilia, Italy works with the electronic band Yue and put out <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/22480">We Don't Care</a></strong> (single), a snappy little song.</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>Merci-Merci</em></strong> does lo-fi slow dance punk from La Rochelle, France.  <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/19861">Souvenirs d'un ocÃ©an disparu</a></strong>'s <em>OcÃ©an Pacifique</em> is a very pleasant listen.</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>Tom Fahy</em></strong> led a prolific group of musicians in St. John's, Canada. <a href="http://www.tomfahy.org/">Fahy</a> died June of this year, a huge loss for music. The group's output of 70 albums on Jamedo ranges stylistically from instrumental rock to jazz to classical, with many variations. Some recommendations include <strong>Endgame: A Tribute to Bobby Fischer</strong>, instrumental rock, hear <em>Defence</em>; <strong><a href="http://archive.org/details/MOTEL_ALBUM">Hotel</a></strong>, raga influenced jazz, <em>Epilogue</em>; <strong><a href="http://archive.org/details/LittleFattyStudiesInAtonality">Little Fatty: Studies in Atonality</a></strong>, classical, <em>Little Fatty No. 1</em>; and <strong><a href="http://archive.org/details/1986-ALBUM">1986</a></strong>, instrumental rock, <em>Miss Rose Tells The Future</em>. [Edited March 2013; see note below]</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>Telemetrics</em></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/31074">Callsign 65:41</a></strong> Noise and samples from Whitehouse, Ohio, USA. 25 minutes of easy on the ears listening.</tt></small></p>
<p><small><tt><strong><em>Jamison Young</em></strong>, a musician and activist from Australia but based in Prague, Czech Republic, had a surprise this year from <strong><a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/18714">Shifting Sands Of A Blue Car</a></strong> when its <em>Memories Child</em> was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8527">featured in the <em>X-Files: I Want to Believe</em> movie</a>. Not my usual type of music, but it grows on you. No reason for it to not be in heavy rotation on a supermarket PA near you.</tt></small></p>
