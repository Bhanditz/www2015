<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2009-06-26#Program">program for the third CC Technology Summit</a> is coming together and <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~techsummit/register.html">registration</a> is now open.  </p>
<p>Once again we're offering a special deal for <a href="http://creativecommons.net">CC Network</a> members (25â‚¬ off the regular price).  The Technology Summit is being organized in collaboration with <a href="http://nexa.polito.it/">NEXA Center for Internet & Society</a> and the timing makes it possible to attend two great Commons events in the same place -- the 2009 <a href="http://communia-project.eu/conf2009">COMMUNIA Conference</a> is taking place two days after the Technology Summit.  If you're already attending COMMUNIA there's a special registration deal for you, too.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, just email techsummit@creativecommons.org.  </p>
