<p>Creative Commonsâ€™ CEO, Joi Ito recently gave a talk at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dld-conference.com/">Digital Life Design</a> conference in Munich. If youâ€™ve been waiting to watch a talk introducing Creative Commons to 2009, <a target="_blank" href="http://video.dld-conference.com/watch/dTMYg3z?t=dld09%2C2009-01-26&amp;gal=sessions">this is your talk</a>.</p>
<p>Joi first hits on how CC helps innovators (especially those online) lower the transaction costs when dealing with cultural works restricted by copyright law. Moreover, CC has the potential lower costs in much of the same way that the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP">openness</a> of the early Internet enabled start-ups like Google and eBay to lower their transaction costs and innovate. Joi then discusses some of the <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=11947">successes CC</a> has seen in the last year, making for an great overview of what CC has been up to and where we are headed.</p>
