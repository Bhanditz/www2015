<p>The National Science Foundation Task Force issued a report late in June on cyberlearning, more specifically on "<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2008/nsf08204/nsf08204.pdf">Fostering Learning in the Networked World: The Cyberlearning Opportunity and Challenge</a>." It is, in their words, "A 21st Century Agenda for the National Science Foundation" concerning ICT for learning. The report outlines five recommendations for "growth and opportunities for action," one of which concerns the promotion of open educational resources (OER). According to recommendation #4:</p>
<p>"Materials funded by NSF should be made readily available on the web with permission for unrestricted reuse and recombination. New grant proposals should make their plans clear for both the availability and the sustainability of materials produced by their funded project."</p>
<p>In the future, ccLearn hopes to see these goals develop into concrete initiatives. The <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> has an annual federal budget of $6.06 billion and currently funds 20% of all federally supported research by higher education institutions in the United States.</p>
