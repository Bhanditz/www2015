<p><a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/">Common Craft</a> is a company that makes videos which are "short, simple and focused on making complex ideas easy to understand." These videos range in topic - from <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/twitter">Twitter</a> to <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/bookmarking-plain-english">social bookmarking</a> to <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/election">electing the U.S. President</a> - and are made using a technique Common Craft calls <em>Paperworks</em>, a whiteboard-and-paper format that <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/work">they believe</a> "is designed to cut out the noise and stick to what matters."</p>
<p>Common Craft make their videos available online for <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/store">businesses to license</a> as educational tools, but also <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/show">share the videos</a> widely under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND license</a>. There are <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/faq#freelicensed">definite advantages</a> for businesses in getting the licensed versions, most notably portability and quality. Outside of this, the CC licensed Common Craft videos have garnered heightened popularity on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/leelefever">YouTube</a> and other sharing sites, increasing their name recognition and ubiquity - two factors that have hopefully been instrumental in expanding their growing list of <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/productions">custom-video clients</a>. Common Craft have a <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1253376">great video</a> posted on their licensing process that explains it all clearly and simply - making it not only informative but also a great example of their production style.</p>
