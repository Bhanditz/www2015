<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21946 alignright" title="Flag_of_Vietnam" src="img/800px-Flag_of_Vietnam.svg_.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Today marks the celebration of the localized Creative Commons  licenses in Vietnam, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international">fifty-third jurisdiction worldwide</a> to adapt the  Creative Commons licensing suite to national law. <a href="http://www.vef.gov/">The Vietnam Education  Foundation</a> together with <a href="http://dnlaw.com.vn/">D&amp;N International</a> and Creative Commons  have overseen the localization of the licenses in consultation with the  Vietnamese public and key stakeholders in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The launch will take place at the Creative Commons workshop on May 7  at 1:00pm during the <a href="http://www.eventbrainz.com/event/ocwc2010">Open CourseWare Consortiumâ€™s (OCWC) fifth annual  conference</a> in Melia Hotel. The three-day OCWC event brings together  educators, administrators, policy makers, and other interested  participants to examine the capacity of Open CourseWare to effect  large-scale educational improvement worldwide. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">Many Open CourseWare and  Open Educational Resources (OER) use Creative Commons licenses</a> to grant  copyright permission to easily access, adapt, and discover the  materials.</p>
<p>â€œAt a time when Vietnam Is taking great efforts to improve education  and strengthen its creative industries, I see the Creative Commons  launch providing a firm foundation on which to build Vietnamâ€™s education  and creative sector in the digital age,â€ says Dr. Lynne McNamara,  Executive Director of the Vietnam Education Foundation. â€œWe greatly  appreciate the support of the OCWC as well for making this event  possible.â€</p>
<p>â€œCC Vietnam led a masterful consultation with the Vietnamese public  and incorporated that feedback into the licenses. The team continues to  connect diverse expertise and passions for the betterment of the local  community. Creative Commons looks forward to the many promising  developments in this dynamic and dedicated region,â€ notes Diane Peters,  General Counsel of Creative Commons.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Vietnam">next phase of CC Vietnam</a> will focus on building multi-stakeholder  groups to promote legal sharing in a variety of fields, such as  photography, education, and music. Institutions and individuals in  Vietnam are welcome to contribute to developing a roadmap for the  national project and to join the launchâ€™s proceedings on May 7.</p>
