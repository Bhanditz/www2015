<p><strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/500px_creative_commons.pdf">Read the full press release. (PDF)</a></strong></p>
<p>This morning, photo-sharing platform <a href="http://500px.com/">500px</a> announced that it now offers Creative Commons licensing options. 500px has become a hub for talented photographers in recent years, and it&#8217;s great to see it join the ranks of CC-enabled platforms.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While our platform still defaults to full copyright protection as it always has, we want to give our photographers as much flexibility as possible to spread their work and build their profiles and businesses,&#8221; says Oleg Gutsol, CEO, 500px. &#8220;Our move to offer Creative Commons licensing is another way weâ€™re providing additional services and value to meet the needs of our growing community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>With tens of millions of high quality professional photos potentially now available through Creative Commons, 500px is planning for the increased traffic from bloggers, publishers and media outlets that have been clamoring to get at the content for several years.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Weâ€™ve built content searching by keywords and applicable license right into the functionality,&#8221; says Gutsol. &#8220;Our hope is that this targeted searching makes it seamless for people to find the content theyâ€™re looking for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>With this rollout, 500px joins the ranks of other prominent rich media communities such as Vimeo, SoundCloud and YouTube who already have Creative Commons in place.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;500px is a great addition to the family of CC-compatible media platforms,&#8221; Creative Commons CEO Cathy Casserly said. &#8220;500px caters to a talented and intelligent community of photographers, just the sort of users we&#8217;re always excited to see licensing their work under CC. I&#8217;ll be curious to see how creative people everywhere reuse and remix the work of 500px photographers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
