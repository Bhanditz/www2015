<p>On Tuesday, 31<sup>st</sup> May at 6pm local time, Creative Commons Qatar will celebrate its  official birth with a reception in a unique venue, the <a href="http://www.mia.org.qa/english/">Museum of  Islamic Art</a> in Doha.</p>
<p>The CC Qatar launch will be a celebration of  Qatari and Arab creativity. Qatar has a flourishing and rapidly  expanding creative scene, which will be featured at the launch through  the works of more than 20 local artists---including photographers,  bloggers, fashion designers, web developers and writers---that are  currently releasing their creations under CC licenses.</p>
<p><a href="http://aljazeera.net ">Al Jazeera</a>, which in 2009 became the first broadcaster in the world to launch a CC-licensed broadcast-quality <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">online footage repository</a> (under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>), will present a video with the latest updates about their CC-released works and exciting projects.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ictqatar.qa/ar">ictQATAR</a>,  which in October 2010 successfully hosted the â€œDigitally Openâ€ summit  and the second CC Arab world regional meeting in Doha, will serve as the  public lead for outreach in Qatar, with the help of a vibrant and very  active  community of Creative Commons advocates, artists and content creators, as well as institutions and organizations.</p>
<p>The launch party will be livestreamed at <span style="color: #1f497d;"> <a href="http://livestream.com/ictQATAR">Livestream.com/ictQATAR</a> </span>from 6 pm to 8 pm local time (GMT + 3).  The festivities will include a live remix by visual artists <a href="http://naeemazarif.com/">Naeema Zarif</a> and <a href="http://www.lenamerhej.com/">Lina Merhej</a> from the CC Lebanon community, and a live DJ/VJ set from <a href=" http://www.celinecelines.com/">Celine Seeman</a><a href="http://www.celinecelines.com/" target="_blank"></a> and <a href="http://noweapon.org/">Colin Brown</a> from CC's Canadian community.</p>
<p>Following the launch, Creative Commons Qatar will host a series of workshops for content creators, as well as support and other community engagement activities. The first series of workshops will take  place on June 1-2 at Virginia Commonwealth University,  Doha Campus. It will be led by Naeema Zarif and focus on how visual artists can leverage Creative Commons licenses with their works.</p>
