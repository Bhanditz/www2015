<p>After an intense 3 months, the 2007 annual fundraising campaign has come to a close. And what a close it has been -- $601,976 raised! The amount, however, is not nearly as noteworthy as the global participation that occurred in order for this campaign to be successful. The map above, displayed on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7710">home page</a> throughout the campaign, shows the geographic distribution of contributors. This is truly a community supported organization. Thank you to everyone who <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">helped</a> us surpass our campaign goal and more importantly thank you for your commitment to keeping culture free.</p>
