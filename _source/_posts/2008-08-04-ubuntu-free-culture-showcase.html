<p>Coming to a Linux distribution near you: The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase">Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase</a>.</p>

<p>The Community Manager for Ubuntu, Jono Bacon, <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=1225">just announced</a> a contest to have your song or video distributed with the next Ubuntu release in October!  What this means is that Ubuntu is giving free culture musicians and movie creators the opportunity to get their work out to <strong>millions</strong> of users.</p>
<p>The contest is pretty simple: </p>
<ul>
<li>you can submit any song or video up to 1 or 3 megs, respectively;</li>
<li>the materially has to be licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a>; </li>
<li>host it somewhere (<a href="http://www.archive.org/create/">archive.org</a> is a good option); </li>
<li>encode using <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg</a>; </li>
<li>and add it to the list on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase">contest wiki page</a>.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The limitation on size is due to the fact that material will be on <strong>every Ubuntu CD</strong> and as such size is a key limitation.</p>
<p>Get your music or video sample out there onto the computers of millions of people by the end of October.  Not many contests can give you such provocative rewards.</p>
