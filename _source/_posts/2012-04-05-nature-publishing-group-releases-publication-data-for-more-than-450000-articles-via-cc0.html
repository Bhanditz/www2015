<p>Yesterday, Nature Publishing Group <a href="http://www.nature.com/press_releases/linkeddata.html">announced</a> the launch of a new <a href="http://data.nature.com/">linked data platform</a>, providing access to "20 million Resource Description Framework (RDF) statements, including primary metadata for more than 450,000 articles published by NPG since 1869. The datasets include basic citation information (title, author, publication date, etc) as well as NPG specific ontologies." All datasets are published using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 public domain dedication</a>, which is not a license, but a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">legal tool</a> that may be used by anyone wishing to permanently surrender the copyright and database rights (where they exist) they may have in a work, thereby placing it as nearly as possible into the public domain.</p>
<p>This is an excellent move by NPG, especially following an opinion piece they published in 2009 explicitly recommending open sharing and the use of CC0 to put data in the public domain, entitled, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7261/full/461171a.html">"Post-publication sharing of data and tools"</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Although it is usual practice for major public databases to make data freely available to access and use, any restrictions on use should be strongly resisted and we endorse explicit encouragement of open sharing, for example under the newly available CC0 public domain waiver of Creative Commons."</p></blockquote>
<p>Many more organizations and institutions are using CC0 to release their data, which you can peruse at our wiki page for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data">CC0 uses with data and databases</a>. CC licenses are also used for data; read more about this and other issues plus an FAQ on CC and data at <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data</a>. </p>
