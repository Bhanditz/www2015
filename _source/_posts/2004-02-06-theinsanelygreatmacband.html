<p>Last month, Apple released <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a> at MacWorld, letting any budding musician create music from its suite of sophisticated but simple audio tools. Given the potential for thousands of musicians recording new songs at home, we knew it was a great fit for Creative Commons and we're very happy to see a new community has sprung up around the software, at <a href="http://macband.com/">MacBand</a>. They've just launched but have a system setup to categorize dozens of song styles and loops, with every song available under a Creative Commons license, letting you make remixes and new songs from others work. Garageband has the great potential to become a collaborative music tool and <a href="http://macband.com/">MacBand</a> looks like a great way to facilitate that.</p>
