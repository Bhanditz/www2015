You've all heard of the <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> Conference (Technology, Entertainment, Design), the annual meeting of great minds with amazing 20 minute speeches that share what they've been doing with their lives. But not all of you may have heard of TEDx---spinoffs off TED that are independently organized around a central theme or idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://tedxnyed.com/">TEDxNYED</a> is one of those spinoffs---"an all-day conference dedicated to examining the intersection of education, new media, and technology, will take place on <strong>March 6, 2010</strong> in New York City." The <a href="http://tedxnyed.com/speakers/">speaker line-up</a> includes our own <a href="http://lessig.org/">Larry Lessig</a> (founder and board member of CC), Michael Wesch (a cultural anthropologist who created those awesome <a href="An anthropological introduction to YouTube ">YouTube videos</a> like "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7240">Web 2.0 ... The Machine is Us/ing Us"</a>), Neeru Khosla (Co-founder of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14141">CK12 Foundation</a> that submitted <a href="http://www.clrn.org/fdti/">seven open textbooks</a> to <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/12996/">California's Free Digital Textbook Initiative</a>), and <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/">David Wiley</a> (big thinker in open education and associate professor of Instructional Psychology and Technology at BYU).</p>
<p><a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org">CC Learn</a> is <a href="http://tedxnyed.com/partners/">partnering</a> with <a href="http://tedxnyed.com/">TEDxNYED</a> and <a href="http://www.whipplehill.com/">Whipple Hill</a> to help with this amazing event. With currently 300 or so people expected to attend, space is limited, so please apply if you would like to join. "TEDx NYED is particularly seeking applicants who work in and around education and who are dedicated to reforming schools from the inside-out as well as outside-in. Those interested in attending should apply at <a href="http://tedxnyed.com/apply"><strong>http://tedxnyed.com/apply</strong></a>."</p>
<p>From the press release,</p>
<blockquote><p>"TED is an annual event where some of the worldâ€™s leading thinkers and doers are invited<br />
to share what they are most passionate about. â€œTEDâ€ stands for Technology,<br />
Entertainment, Design â€” three broad subject areas that are, collectively, shaping our<br />
future... The diverse audience â€” CEOs, scientists, creatives, philanthropists â€” is<br />
almost as extraordinary as the speakers, who have included Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jane<br />
Goodall, Frank Gehry, Paul Simon, Sir Richard Branson, Philippe Starck and Bono.<br />
...<br />
At the TEDx NYED event, live speakers, two Ted Talks videos, and networking<br />
sessions will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The<br />
TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx<br />
events, including ours, are self-organized."</p></blockquote>
