<p>Last night, we hosted another edition of our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC Salon</a> series in Los Angeles. <a href="http://dublab.com/">Dublab</a>'s Mark McNeill and Ale Cohen discussed their endeavors in Web radio, art, and film - as well as <a href="http://intoinfinity.org/">Into Infinity</a>, the art and music exhibition they're producing in collaboration with Creative Commons. <a href="http://gonze.com/blog/">Lucas Gonze</a> gave a presentation about the economics of online music, which developed into an extended audience conversation about media business models and self-distribution. The night was a great success, with some of the most thoughtful interaction we've seen come out of these events. Thanks to the presenters, all of the attendees, and to Jonny Coleman of <a href="http://www.foundla.com/">Found Gallery</a>, who has graciously let us use his space for CC Salon LA for the past year.</p>
