<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/publicize/musetta"><img align="right" border="0" src="img/musetta_93x93.gif" /></a>As <a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> passed the 5,000 upload mark and our star remixer <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/teru">teru</a> approaches 100 remixes (no accident that his average rating is 4.75 out of 5 by the way) we're eager to encourage folks with blogs and web pages to check out a new feature that makes it easy to embed dynamic links or <a href="http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net">Fabricio Zuardi's Music Player</a> powered by a XSPF playlist into your pages. Appropriately enough we called the feature <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/publicize/teru">Publicize</a>. This feature not only applies to remixers, but also their subjects because you can specify that you want the <i>remixes of</i> the artist -- hey, 25 remixes of <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/publicize/musetta">musetta's</a> "<a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/files/musetta/6343">Ophelia's Song</a>" can't be wrong. (Publicize <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/publicize/musetta">here</a>).</p>
<p>
Publicize and the new <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/view/media/remix/radio">Remix Radio</a> are just two very early features of many that will be falling out of the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/viewfile/query">Query/Formatter API</a> currently under development. Armed with this API developers can query ccMixter in hundreds of ways and ask for the results in a large variety of formats -- RSS, XSPF, ATOM, M3U, CSV, AJAX/JSON, etc. as well as pre-formatted HTML. We look forward to mashups of ccMixter remixes and other CC content sites (*<a href="http://flickr.com/services/">cough</a>*).</p>
