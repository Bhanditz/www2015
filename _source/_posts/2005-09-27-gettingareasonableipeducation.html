<p>A lecture on Creative Commons will form part of the induction training programme for incoming graduate research students at <a href="http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk/">Goldsmith's College</a>, University of London, this week. Andrea Rota, who is a member of the <a href="http://liquidculture.info/taxonomy/term/6">Liquid Culture project</a> at Goldsmith's College, will be giving the lecture on "A range of protections and freedoms for researchers, authors and artists" as part of the scheduled activities for new graduate research students in induction week. Of course, the <a href="http://liquidculture.info/taxonomy/term/10">lecture materials</a> themselves are available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 license</a>. The induction training programme includes sessions dedicated to copyright and IP issues for research students. This year the Research Office and, in particular, PÃ¡draig O'Connor, worked together with Liquid Culture, a student-led project focused on Creative Commons, to deliver a complementary view on copyright issues besides the traditional "all rights reserved" one.</p>
<p>A welcome initiative bringing balance back into education about intellectual property issues.</p>
