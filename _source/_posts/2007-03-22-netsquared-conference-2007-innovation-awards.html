<p><a href="http://www.netsquared.org/2006/conference">Last year</a> NetSquared put on a great conference in San Jose, California on the use of technology in nonprofit orgainizations. <small>(And did a great job of documenting the conference, e.g.,<a href="http://netsquared.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=140153">audio from my session on Free Speech and Free Culture</a>, <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/2006/conference/remote/transcripts/mike-linksvayer">chat transcript</a>, and separate <a href="http://odeo.com/audio/1358952/view">audio</a> and <a href="http://www.blip.tv/file/46549/">video</a> interviews and <a href="http://odeo.com/audio/1361082/view">presentation audio</a> from a subsequent NetTuesday presentation.)</small></p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/2007/conference">2007</a> Netsquared is organizing the conference around 20 startup social enterprises (not not be strictly nonprofit) using technology for social change. Chosen organizations will have expenses paid for two staff members to attend the conference and funding from the <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/2007/partner/netsquared-technology-innovation-fund">NetSquared Technology Innovation Fund</a>.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/projects/nominate">nominate</a> your social enterprise. I encourage you especially if your project as a free culture angle -- as every project should :).</p>
<p>Answer to the obvious question: Creative Commons itself is too established for nomination, though we will participate through advocacy and mentoring.</p>
