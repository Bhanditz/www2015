<p>In July the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/colombian-student-faces-prison-charges-sharing-academic-article-online">wrote about</a> the predicament that Colombian student Diego Gomez found himself in after he shared a research article online. Gomez is a <a href="http://www.karisma.org.co/compartirnoesdelito/?p=256%20">graduate student</a> in conservation and wildlife management at a small university. He has generally poor access to many of the resources and databases that would help him conduct his research. Paltry access to useful materials combined with a natural culture of sharing amongst researchers prompted Gomez shared a paper on Scribd so that he and others could access it for their work. The practice of learning and sharing under less-than-ideal circumstances could land Diego in prison.</p>
<p>The EFF reports that upon learning of this unauthorized sharing, the author of the research article filed criminal complaint against Gomez. The charges lodged against Diego could put him in prison for 4-8 years. The trial has started, and the court will need to take into account several factors: including whether there was any malicious intent to the action, and whether there was any actual harm against the economic rights of the author.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, Creative Commons, <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/">Right to Research Coalition</a>, and <a href="https://www.openaccessbutton.org/">Open Access Button</a> are <strong><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/let-s-stand-together-to-promote-open-access-worldwide">launching a campaign</a></strong> to help raise awareness about Diego's situation, to promote a reasonable handling of his and similar cases, and to support open access policies and practices. We hope you'll sign on.</p>

<h3>Let's stand together to promote Open Access worldwide.</h3>
<p><em>Help Diego Gomez and join academics and users in fighting outdated laws and practices that keep valuable research locked up for no good reason.</em></p>
<p>Diego Gomez, a Colombian graduate student, currently faces up to eight years in prison for doing something thousands of researchers do every day: posting research results online for those who would not otherwise have a way to access them.</p>
<p>If open access were the default for scholarly communication, cases like Diego's would become obsolete.</p>
<p>Academic research would be free to access and available under an open license that would legally enable the kind of sharing that is so crucial for enabling scientific progress.</p>
<p>When research is shared freely and openly, we all benefit. <a href="https://act.eff.org/action/let-s-stand-together-to-promote-open-access-worldwide">Sign the petition</a> to express your support for Open Access as the default for scientific and scholarly publishing, so researchers like Diego don't risk severe penalties for helping colleagues access the research they need.</p>
<p><strong>Sign-on statement:</strong><br />Scientific and scholarly progress relies upon the exchange of ideas and research. We all benefit when research is shared widely, freely, and openly. I support an Open Access system for academic publishing that makes research free for anyone to read and re-use; one that is inclusive of all and doesn't force researchers like Diego Gomez to risk severe penalties for helping colleagues access the research they need.</p>
