<p><a href="http://flickrcash.com/">FlickrCash</a> uses the Flickr API to search by CC license, build lightboxes, and keep a record of licensed photos you intend to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/acfou/">Augustine Fou</a>, creator of FlickrCash, tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>I created FlickrCash because I found many really beautiful photos on Flickr but could not use them for "commercial" purposes like design work for clients, because there was no way to document I had a license to use it.  FlickrCash is BOTH a search/find interface to more quickly find images on Flickr, and also a way to document that you have a license to use a specific image.</p>
<p>Sample of image search (currently only searches Flickr repository):<br />
<a href="http://flickrcash.com/?k=flowers">http://flickrcash.com/?k=flowers</a></p>
<p>Sample of archived license, available for inspection at any time:<br />
<a href="http://flickrcash.com/license/27i8d5sf">http://flickrcash.com/license/27i8d5sf</a></p>
<p>With this publicly archived license the image buyer can definitively prove they have the right to use a specific image for a specific purpose -- so they can use it for client design work. Both image owner and image buyer are named signatories to the agreement, and an official date/time stamp is obtained from the NIST Atomic Clock to document the exact time the license was executed.</p></blockquote>
