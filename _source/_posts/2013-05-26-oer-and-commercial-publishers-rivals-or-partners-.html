<p>The Software &amp; Information Industry Association (SIIA) is holding their tenth annual <a href="http://www.siia.net/etis/2013/" target="_blank">Ed Tech Industry Summit</a> in San Francisco, May 5-7, 2013. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://www.siia.net/etis/2013/"><img src="img/edtechsummit2.jpg" alt="edtechsummit2" width="500" height="124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38141" /></a></p>
<p>The "navigating next" conference theme aims to help schools navigate the change and opportunity education technology brings. A hot topic at this years summit is a session titled "OER and Commercial Publishers: Rivals or Partners?" </p>
<p>In March 2013, SIIA released a <a href="http://siia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1275:siia-releases-guide-on-the-use-of-open-educational-resources-oer-in-k-12-and-postsecondary-education-&amp;catid=62:press-room-overview&amp;Ite" target="_blank">Guide to the Use of Open Educational Resources in K-12 and Postsecondary Education</a>. At this year's Ed Tech Industry Summit, a panel, including Creative Commons CEO Cathy Casserly, will be discussing a range of topics explored in the guide including opportunities and challenges for commercial publishers, content aggregators and online platforms; OERâ€™s role in the future of digital publishing; and OER business and sustainability models in the K-20 education market.</p>
<p>The SIIA guide includes sections on:</p>
<ul>
<li>OER Defined</li>
<li>Total Cost of Development/Total Cost of Ownership</li>
<li>Business Models</li>
<li>Government &amp; Non-Profit Activities</li>
<li>OER Frequently Asked Questions</li>
</ul>
<p>The guide provides good coverage of OER definitions and some of the many government and non-profit <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry" title="OER Policy Registry">OER policies</a> (i.e., publicly funded resources = openly licensed resources) and OER initiatives around the world. </p>
<p>As might be expected, the guide depicts OER from the publishers perspective. OER clearly are a business disruptor for publishers and the general tone of the guide is a reluctant acknowledgement of OER as a new significant player while at the same time striving to create OER fear, uncertainty, and doubt by suggesting a "user beware" perspective.</p>
<p>The SIIA guide presents a total cost of ownership (TCO) description without doing a side-by-side comparison of costs associated with institutional development and maintenance of OER compared to external purchasing costs associated with acquiring publisher developed proprietary content. For example, Washington State's Open Course Library <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/37920">released 39 additional</a> CC licensed courses this week. Their press release provides some important TCO information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student savings are already stacking up. According to an <a href="http://studentpirgs.org/resources/updated-cost-analysis-open-course-library">analysis released by the Student PIRGs</a>, the Open Course Library has saved students $5.5 million to date, including $2.9 million this academic year alone. </li>
<li>Students who take OCL courses save $96 on average versus using an expensive, traditional textbook. </li>
<li>A 2011 analysis by the same organization found that the savings could climb to $41.6 million annually if Open Course Library materials are adopted statewide.</li>
<li>While college textbooks frequently cost $200 apiece, OCL course materials cost no more than $30 per course and are freely available for use by the stateâ€™s 34 public community and technical colleges, four-year colleges and universities, and anyone else in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The return on investment of this project to date? The textbook savings are more than triple the original investment of $1.8 million.</p>
<p>The SIIA report also does not acknowledge the unique benefits open licenses create around collaboration, reuse, repurposing and continuous improvement. No where are educator OER cost benefits described such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>OER allow faculty to access the work of their peers, learn from each other and make improvements in real-time based on seeing other examples</li>
<li>OER jumpstart development by providing pre-built building blocks of educational content that has been peer-reviewed and peer developed</li>
<li>OER allow for sharing local knowledge globally</li>
<li>OER provide for local control, flexibility to personalize, and speed of customization</li>
<li>OER build reputations of developers and incentivize collaboration</li>
<li>OER enable education to take place that would not previously have been possible</li>
</ul>
<p>SIIA descriptions of business models are understandably from the commercial supplier perspective. Missing is any examination or description of the new business models OER create for education providers. OER provide schools, post-secondary institutions and corporate education providers with new business model opportunities. Unfortunately, the SIIA guide makes no attempt to show how OER affect the underlying business model of schools and institutions. By looking at OER primarily from a publishing and cost perspective the SIIA guide misses the opportunity to understand OER from a consumer (learners, teachers, institutions) perspective. </p>
<p>A counter balance to the SIIA publishers view of OER is provided by the just released Commonwealth of Learning's <a href="http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=446">Open Educational Resources: Innovation, Research and Practice</a>. COL's publication describes OER from the perspective of education institutions and teachers. It includes an examination of the social exchange aspects of OER, inter-institutional collaborative frameworks for OER, and approaches to the production and use of OER. While SIIA's guide is primarily for publishers, COL's book will appeal to governments, schools, institutions and educators.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=446"><img src="img/COLOER.png" alt="COLOER" width="160" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38060" /></a><br /><small><span></span><span>Commonwealth of Learning and Athabasca University</span> / <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a></small></p>
<p>The impact and benefits of OER are not just cost savings, but pedagogical innovation, new models of course development and delivery, faculty peer review of educational resources, and generation of direct benefits to students (including the the ability to access and keep educational materials for life and the freedom to modify and improve them). While largely absent from SIIA's guide, these impacts and benefits come through loud and clear in COL's book. </p>
<p>Clearly the publishing industry is in the midst of disruptive change similar to that of movies, music and newspapers. The publishing industryâ€™s historical role has been to select expertise, support/edit/vet content creation, edit and assemble content into well designed formats with high production values, and then market, sell and distribute content to schools. </p>
<p>OER disrupt publishers' traditional role. OER are collegial and distributed across the academy -- not selected and controlled by publishers. Rather than outsourcing content creation to publishers, educators are taking control of this role themselves and creating works that are shared with networks of peers to ensure quality and distributed online at the marginal cost of $0.</p>
<p>While OER clearly affect traditional publisher control over selection of expertise and creation of content OER also open up an opportunity for publishers. OER licensed with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)</a>  are equally available to the publishing industry for reuse, remix and repurposing. Seen in this light, OER could be a huge boon to the publishing industry â€“ hundreds of millions of dollars of vetted, high quality content is available to publishers to freely use for business purposes. In addition many of the traditional functions of publishers such as vetting content, assembling content into well designed formats with high production values, and marketing and distribution are needed in the OER space. There is a role for publishers to play in this new mixed open and commercial space - though it may be a different role with different business models, costs, revenues, ownership and control.</p>
<p>OER and commercial publishers can be partners, but only if publishers stop promoting OER fear, uncertainty, and doubt and instead embrace OER and transition their business processes and models to add value to OER. As a new market force, OER provide publishers with the opportunity to create and support new forms of publishing that further affordable, high quality education opportunities for all.</p>
