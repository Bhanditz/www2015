<p>CC staff favorite and <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> artist, <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/">Brad Sucks</a> recently started <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000477.php">releasing the source to his most popular song</a>, Making Me Nervous, and asking folks to contribute remixes. Like the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4162">Jim's Big Ego remix project</a> we're got going on here (which can <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4214">get your remix onto national radio</a>), Brad's now got six remixes (<a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000494.php#000494">1</a>, <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000493.php#000493">2</a>, <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000492.php#000492">3</a>, <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000489.php#000489">4</a>, <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000484.php#000484">5</a>, <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000484.php#000484">6</a>) and someone <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000491.php#000491">making a video</a> for the original. </p>
<p>It's pretty cool when artists open up the process to their fans, and let creativity flourish. Heck, even a commercial success like Jay-Z can see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00022FWZ4/">there's money to be made in providing remixes</a> that provide eventual benefit to both remixers and the original artists.</p>
