<p>As CC headquarters starts to wind down for the end of the year, it gives me great pleasure to announce two new CC Affiliates from Kazakhstan and Rwanda.</p>
<p>Led by Rauan Kenzhekhanuly and including Almas Nurbakytov, Nartay Ashim and Balashov Talgat, the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan team</a> is supported by <a href="http://wikibilim.kz/">Wikibilim</a>, a non-profit organisation which is devoted to expanding the availability of free knowledge in the Kazakh language, focusing on forums such as the Kazakh Wikipedia. Wikibilim is supported by the Government of Kazakhstan and personally by the Prime-Minister Mr. Karim Masimov.  The members of Wikibilim have a great deal of experience in the open community, and are working actively to promote open knowledge and free culture values in Kazakhstan, with a particular focus on increasing the quantity of Kazakh-language material available under open licences. Those who attended the recent <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011">Global Summit</a> in Warsaw may have met Rauan and Almas, who were enthusiastic participants on behalf of their team.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Rwanda">Rwanda team</a>, led by Jacques Murinda and including Fred Byabagabo and Prosper Birama, is working in conjunction with the <a href="http://ole.org/">Open Learning Exchange</a> (OLE), an NGO supported by the Rwandan Ministry of Education, which aims to provide universal access to basic education by 2015. The Rwandan team has been active in the CC Africa community for some time and is particularly focused on promoting open educational resources (OER) and open courseware (OCW) initiatives in the region. </p>
<p>We welcome both these teams to our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">affiliate network</a>, and look forward to working with them as they develop the CC community in their regions. </p>
<p>This brings the total number of official CC affiliates at the end of 2011 to 72, the highest level since the project launched in 2002. A good start for our tenth birthday celebrations next year -- see you all there!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> - This article had previously incorrectly identified Wikibilim as the official representative of Wikimedia in Kazakhstan.</p>
