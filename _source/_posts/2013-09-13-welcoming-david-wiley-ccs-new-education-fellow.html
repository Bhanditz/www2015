<p>David Wiley, longtime open education leader, has joined Creative Commons as a <a href="http://staging.creativecommons.org/staff#davidwiley">CC Education Fellow</a>. Welcome David!</p>
<p>David is also currently a Shuttleworth Fellow, on leave from Brigham Young University, and leading <a href="http://www.lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning</a>, an organization dedicated to supporting and improving the adoption of open educational resources (OER) by middle schools, high schools, community and state colleges, and universities.</p>
<p>David will be promoting Creative Commons and its interests in open education activities and meetings and will:</p>
<ul>
<li>visit institutions of secondary and post-secondary education promoting OER and CC licenses;</li>
<li>continue to share his "<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/140/intro-to-openness-in-education/">Intro to Openness in Education</a>" course with the <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a>;</li>
<li>actively participate in the <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/">Open Policy Network</a>; and</li>
<li>create, CC license, and publish primers on OER and open textbook adoption at the secondary level and post-secondary level.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start, David addresses the problems with the "open" washing that is occurring with more frequency in education as OER gains popularity, over at his <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2922">blog</a>. Welcome David!</p>
