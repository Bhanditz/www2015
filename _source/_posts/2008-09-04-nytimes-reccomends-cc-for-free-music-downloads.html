<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">the New York Times</a> published an article titled "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/technology/personaltech/04basics.html?ex=1378267200&amp;en=5941bed8165f9d07&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">Free Music Downloads Without the Legal Peril</a> " in which they gave CC a nice plug:</p>
<blockquote><p> Creative Commons is a site that helps copyright holders decide which rights they want to share â€” for instance making songs free for personal use and distribution, but not for sampling or commercial use. The five-year-old organization said it had licensed about 1 million songs, and lists them at <a href="creativecommons.org/legalmusicforvideos">creativecommons.org/legalmusicforvideos</a>. One user of Creative Commons, the eclectic radio station WFMU-FM, posts legal in-studio performances at <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org">freemusicarchive.org</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article mentions some other free music alternatives (such as promos on <em>iTunes</em> and <em>Amazon MP3</em>) and although it doesn't exactly nail what we do - we haven't licensed any songs ourselves, that is all thanks to <strong>YOU in the CC community</strong> - it is great to be featured regardless.</p>
