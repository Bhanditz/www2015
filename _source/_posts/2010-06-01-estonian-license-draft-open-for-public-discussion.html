<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/ee/"><img class="size-full wp-image-22211 alignright" title="Flag_of_Estonia.svg" src="img/800px-Flag_of_Estonia.svg_.png" alt="" width="300" height="191" /></a>A license draft <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/ee/">adapted to Estonian law</a> is ready for public discussion, the first CC license available for review in the Baltic.</p>
<p>The public discussion is an open forum where everyone â€“Â  from lawyers   to active license users, from linguists to translators â€” is invited to   contribute. If you have comments about different aspects of the   licenses, whether in regards to legal, linguistic or usability issues,   please feel welcome to join the <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-estonia">CC  Estonia mailing list</a> and share your thoughts. Comments should be  submitted as soon as  possible to allow enough time for review, so we  encourage you to post to  the list before the end of June, when the  discussion is scheduled to close.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ongoing efforts of Project Lead EneÂ Koitla at the <a href="http://www.eitsa.ee/?url=eitf">Estonian   Information Technology  Foundation</a>, and her legal team Priit LÃ¤tt, Hele Karja, and Heiki Pisuke of <a href="http://www.glimstedt.ee/en.php">Glimstedt Straus  &amp;  Partners</a> and independent legal expert Mario Rosentau from the  University of  Tartu for producing the draft and soliciting feedback from the Estonian public.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/international/ee/translated-license.pdf">Estonian</a> and <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/international/ee/english-retranslation.pdf">English</a> versions of the BY-NC-SA license are available, as is a <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/international/ee/english-changes.pdf">summary   of the substantial changes</a> proposed by the legal team to port the   licenses to Estonian copyright law.</p>
<p>Efforts in the Baltic are mounting, as CC Estonia is joined by the neighboring Lithuanian team in localizing and promoting Creative Commons. CC Lithuania, currently working on a first draft themselves, recently held a workshop in Vilnius and <a href="http://events.creativecommons.lt/1/cookies.png">baked some delicious CC cookies</a>.</p>
<p>As activities in the Baltic continue to expand and gather peer  support, we hope that the Estonian public discussion will foster more  cross-border collaborations, as part of <a href="http://europe.creativecommons.org/">larger efforts across Europe</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international">the globe</a>.</p>
<p><em>Congratulations to CC Estonia, and we all look forward to comments  from you, the public!</em></p>
