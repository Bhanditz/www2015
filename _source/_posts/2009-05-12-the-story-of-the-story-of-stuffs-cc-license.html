On Sunday <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/11/education/11stuff.html?_r=1">The New York Times covered Annie Leonard's massively successful</a> "<a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com">Story of Stuff</a>" short, noting that it has been viewed millions of times and that Leonard has sold over 7,000 DVD copies of the film.  We were delighted to discover that the short is licensed under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND</a> license, allowing for non-commercial reuse and sharing. On the DVD order page, the team notes that the <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/dvd.html">DVDs can be duplicated and shown in classrooms</a>, but also  points those looking to prevent waste to a <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/downloads.html">50mb .mov download of the whole film</a>.  The site also encourages supporters to organize <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/host.html">their own screenings of the shorts using free PDF resources</a> to help with promotion and discussion.</p>
<p>The story of "The Story of Stuff" demonstrates a kind of savvy that more activists using media should adopt: create an engaging message and find every possible way to encourage your supporters to promote, share, and distribute it. </p>
