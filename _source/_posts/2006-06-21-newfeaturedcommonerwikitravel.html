<p>Our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/wikitravel">latest Featured Commoner</a> tells the story of <a href="http://wikitravel.org/">Wikitravel</a> - why it was started, how it has been built up & organized and its experience of CC licensing.  As we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5864">mentioned</a> earlier in the year, in April 2006 Wikitravel was one of two wikis that were acquired by Internet Brands, which makes this a very interesting chapter in the development of new business models around open content licensing.</p>
