<p>So in my haste to get ccPublisher 1.1 out on Monday, I neglected to include some of the supporting files in the distribution.  This didn't cause immediate problems on Windows, but did prevent the application from launching on Mac OS X.  So without further delay, <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher">ccPublisher</a> 1.1.1.  <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher/latest.msi">Windows</a> and <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher/latest.dmg">Mac OS X</a> download available.</p>
