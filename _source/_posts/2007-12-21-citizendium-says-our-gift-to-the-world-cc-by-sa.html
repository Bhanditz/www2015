<p><span style="text-align: center">The <a href="http://en.citizendium.org"><em>Citizendium</em></a> encyclopedia project today <a href="http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Citizendium_Press_Releases/Dec212007">announced</a> it had chosen to use the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license</a> after very serious consideration of all of the options -- see project founder Larry Sanger's <a href="http://www.citizendium.org/czlicense.html">22,000 word essay on the choice</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>In short, Sanger argues that adopting the CC-by-sa license is most in line with the project's top goal, of "giving the broadest access to vast amounts of high-quality reference content," as well as the main mean to this end, of motivating participants. The project rejected a license (CC-by-nc-sa) that would forbid commercial reuse, an issue on which "Citizens" were evenly divided.</p>
<p>The project will in coming months turn to recruitment and expanding its governance processes. The changes are anticipated to greatly increase the rate at which articles are approved by <em>Citizendium</em> expert editors.</p></blockquote>
