<p>In the U.S., the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/07/request-information-public-access-digital-data-and-scientific-publications">has released</a> two Requests for Information (RFI) soliciting public input on long term preservation of and public access to the results of federally funded research, including digital data and peer-reviewed scholarly publications. The deadline for responding to the RFIs is January 2, 2012. </p>
<p>Persons and parties interested in weighing in on the requests can find more information in the Federal Register announcements:</p>

<p>Our friends at <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/">SPARC</a> offer <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/action/action_access/11-1117.shtml">some additional guidance</a>, also listed below:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important that as many individuals and organizations as possible â€“ at all levels â€“ respond to these requests for information. For reference, the RFI specifically calls for comments from â€œnon-Federal stakeholders, including the public, universities, nonprofit and for-profit publishers, libraries, federally funded and non-federally funded research scientists, and other organizations and institutions with a stake in long-term preservation and access to the results of federally funded research.â€ Both RFIs pose a series of questions, and respondents should answer those questions as specifically as possible. <em>It should be emphasized that organizations beyond the U.S., with experience with open-access policies, are also invited to contribute.</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The input provided through this RFI will inform the National Science and Technology Councilâ€™s Task Force on Public Access to Scholarly Publications, convened by OSTP. OSTP will issue a report to Congress describing: 1) Priorities for the development of agency policies for ensuring broad public access to the results of federally funded, unclassified research; 2) The status of agency policies for public access to publications resulting from federally funded research; and 3) Public input collected.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The main point to emphasize is that taxpayers are entitled to access the results of the research our tax dollars fund. Taxpayers should be allowed to immediately access and fully reuse the results of publicly funded research. </p></blockquote>
<p>Again, the deadline for submissions is January 2, 2012. Submissions to the publications RFI should be sent via email to publicaccess [at] ostp [dot] gov. Submissions to the data RFI should be sent via email to digitaldata [at] ostp [dot] gov. Please note: OSTP will publicly post all submissions after the deadlines (along with names of submitters and their institutions) so please make sure not to include any confidential or proprietary information in your submission. Attachments may be included.</p>
