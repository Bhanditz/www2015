<p>In January I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35378">blogged</a> about Blackboard xpLor -- a new cloud-based learning object repository that was being piloted at 70 institutions. Blackboard officially <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/About-Bb/News-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=122700">released</a> it today, giving educators the ability to discover, create, and share resources across learning management systems (LMS). As part of its launch, xpLor has integrated support for CC license options for creators of content as well as the search and discovery of existing OER under CC licenses, such as the Khan Academy's rich collection of videos and exercises. xpLor currently offers four CC license options for course creators (CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA) in addition to the CC0 public domain waiver, which allows you to waive all copyrights to your work should you choose to do so. </p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/About-Bb/News-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=122700">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Users can create and store materials in xpLor, and then extend their content by sharing and making it discoverable to instructors across working groups, courses and institutions. Content is delivered through the cloud to users' LMS; xpLor currently supports Blackboard Learnâ„¢, ANGEL, JouleÂ® from Moodlerooms and Sakai. Users can tag and rate content, making it easy to find items their peers found to be valuable.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
Content can be adapted over time by multiple users. Content authors can control who can see and change their content, and can apply to their work a variety of rights and permissions from All Rights Reserved to Creative Commons open sharing, to enable crowdsourcing collaboration and remixing of content.</p></blockquote>
<p>For details with screenshots of the CC license implementation, see my <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35378">earlier post</a>. If you want to check it out yourself, you can via <a href="http://coursesites.com/">CourseSites</a> or an existing LMS account with your institution (as named above). If you use a different LMS, xpLor may work with it if your LMS employs IMS standards -- since xpLor is cloud-based and built to work across systems.
