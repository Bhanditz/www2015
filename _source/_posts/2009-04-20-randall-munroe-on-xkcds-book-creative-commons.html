Today's New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/business/media/20link.html">reports</a> on <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a> cartoonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randall Munroe</a>'s foray into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life_%28reality%29">IRL</a> publishing, so we wanted take the opportunity to congratulate Randall for the book deal, but we also wanted to point out his typically pithy and brilliant perspective in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/business/media/20link.html?scp=1&sq=xkcd&st=cse">the NYTimes article on the book's copyright and his choice to use Creative Commons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Does that mean that the book wonâ€™t carry a traditional copyright and instead take its lead from the online comic strip itself, which Mr. Munroe licenses under Creative Commons, allowing noncommercial re-use as long as credit is given?</p>
<p>â€œTo anyone who wants to photocopy, bind, and give a copy of the book to their loved one â€” more power to them,â€ he said. â€œHe/She will likely be disappointed that youâ€™re so cheap, though.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>Randall's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd#Awards_and_recognition">award</a> winning webcomic <a href="http://www.xkcd.com">XKCD</a> is updated frequently and released under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>.</p>
