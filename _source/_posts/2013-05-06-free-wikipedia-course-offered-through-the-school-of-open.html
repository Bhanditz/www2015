<p>Have you ever looked at an article on Wikipedia and thought, "this could really use some work"? With the free online course â€œ<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/49/writing-wikipedia-articles-the-basics-and-beyond/">Writing Wikipedia Articles: The Basics and Beyond</a>,â€ offered through the <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a>, you have the opportunity to take the next step. </p>
<p>In the course, you will learn about both the technical and social underpinnings of this worldwide, volunteer-built resource, and how you can most effectively contribute to its vision to freely share knowledge. The six-week course will start its second round on <strong>14 May</strong> (for those in the Americas) or <strong>15 May</strong> (Asia/Australia).* Sign up <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/49/writing-wikipedia-articles-the-basics-and-beyond/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While the course is free and open to everyone, it focuses on the topic of open educational resources (OER), and students work to improve relevant Wikipedia articles as part of their coursework. The <a href="http://wikistrategies.net/wikisoo-1">first round of the course</a> concluded last week. The course organizers, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27552">Pete Forsyth</a> and Sara Frank Bristow of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Communicate_OER">Communicate OER</a>, had so much fun that they are diving right back in to facilitate a second round. Pete says,  </p>
<blockquote><p>"We learned a great deal in our first run: we were surprised by how few of our students knew about OER, but also how fully they embraced the topic. We hope you will agree, their efforts to improve the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Educational_Resources">OER article</a> have been successful: while there will always be room for improvement, todayâ€™s version of the article is much improved from the version prior to the start of our class."</p></blockquote>
<p>Several members of the CC community were proud to support this effort. In the first round, CC CEO Cathy Casserly participated in a panel discussion and CC Senior Project Manager Paul Stacey provided a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Open_educational_resources#Re-working_Structure_of_Main_OER_article">review of the OER article</a> around which the course participants shaped their improvements.</p>
<p>Creative Commons encourages you to take advantage of this opportunity to contribute to the worldâ€™s understanding of open educational resources and the open licenses that make them possible. <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/49/writing-wikipedia-articles-the-basics-and-beyond/">Sign up for the upcoming course today</a>. You can also participate in a future course or engage in other ways by reaching out to the course organizers at the <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/49/writing-wikipedia-articles-the-basics-and-beyond/">same link</a>.</p>

You are welcome to enroll and watch the archived sessions each week; join the third round of the course, expected to launch in July; or watch for the self-paced version of the course, to be announced in early June.</small></p>
