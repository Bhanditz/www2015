<p>
<a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/buy.php">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>, Cory Doctorow's first novel released a little over a year ago, has <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/archives/2004_02.php#000117">just been relicensed under an Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license</a>. Previously the book did not allow derivative works and any "<a href="http://www.worldnewyork.net/lostkingdom/">lost chapters</a>" or comic versions were unauthorized. With this change in place, the door is wide open to people writing prequels, sequels, and side stories, you can make a movie, cartoon, or graphic novel, you can write songs for it, rewrite it in haiku, and/or turn it all into one giant flowchart, as long as your new Down and Out-inspired work isn't released in a commercial context or sold.</p>

Let the re-creativity begin!</p>
