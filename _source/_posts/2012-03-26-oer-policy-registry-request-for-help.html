Update June 2012:</strong> The OER Policy Registry has moved to its permanent home at <a href="http://oerpolicies.org" title="OER Policy Registry">http://oerpolicies.org</a>, please review and contribute any new policies there.</p>
<p><strong>Update October 2012:</strong> We've removed the links to the Google Form and spreadsheet below. <strong>Please visit the OER Policy Registry's permanent home at <a href="http://oerpolicies.org" title="OER Policy Registry">http://oerpolicies.org</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The open community shares a need for more information to help us with our work. We know, for example, that there are many policies supporting open education at institutions and governments throughout the world. Many of us know of some of these policies, but it would be extremely helpful if we had a single database of open education policies that the entire community could access and update.</p>
<p>To meet this goal, Creative Commons has received a small grant to create an "OER Policy Registry." The Open Educational Resources (OER) Policy Registry will be a place for policymakers and open advocates to easily share and update OER legislation, OER institutional policies and supporting OER policy resources. We have begun to enter OER policies into the registry, but we need your help to make it a truly useful global resource.</p>
<p>The open movement is reaching a stage where we've had some real, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education#OER%20policy">concrete OER policy victories</a> and there is the potential to achieve many more.  Sharing our collective knowledge of existing OER policies, in the same way we believe in sharing educational resources, will help advocates and policymakers worldwide be more successful.</p>
<p>Please join the effort:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>Contribute any OER policies you know about via this Google form.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are collecting both legislative AND institutional (non-legislative) OER policies from around the world. Your form submissions will be added to the draft list of OER policies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> <strong>Review the draft list of OER policies.</strong> (Google doc)</p>
<ul>
<li>If any entries need to be fixed, please email us at <a href="mailto:oer@creativecommons.org">oer@creativecommons.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> <strong>Pass on this call to your colleagues, lists, blogs, and other channels</strong>, to ensure that we get as much input as possible. As the OER movement is global, it is critical that we capture OER policies from around the world.</p>
<p>Anyone can add OER policies to the Google form through the next month. Beginning May 1, the OER Policy Registry will move to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons wiki</a>. At that point, anyone will be able to edit and update the OER Policy Registry on the wiki, and all contributions will be licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>.</p>
<p>We're starting with a Google form because (a) it's easy and (b) wikis require you to create an account before editing, and that may be a barrier to participation.</p>
<p>CC is in contact with other projects that collect similar information, including UNESCO, CoL, the Florida Distance Learning Consortium, EU OCW and a project in New Zealand. We will add OER policy data they gather as it becomes available. If anyone knows of other efforts to gather OER policies, please send them to Anna Daniel (<a href="mailto:anna@creativecommons.org">anna@creativecommons.org</a>) and we will reach out to them too.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions or feedback on the content and/or framework, please <a href="mailto:oer@creativecommons.org">let us know</a>.</p>
