<p>Just in time for Thanksgiving (and yet another thing to be thankful for), we've released an update to ccPublisher.  ccPublisher 0.9.9 (<a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher/ccpublisher-0.9.9.msi">windows</a>, <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher/ccpublisher-0.9.9.dmg">mac</a>) adds support for Internet Archive keywords and description information.  Supplying this information will allow visitors to the Archive find your work, become your fan, and stalk you by going through your trash.  Well, probably (hopefully?) not the last one,  but you get the picture: better exposure through metadata.</p>
<p>Not familiar with ccPublisher?  Check out our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4507">initial release</a> announcement.</p>
<p>This is hopefully our final beta release before 1.0, so download it and give it a try.  You can <a href="mailto:nathan@creativecommons.org">email me</a> bugs, or (even better) submit them <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=80503&atid=559966">at SourceForge</a>.  Enjoy!</p>
