<p>Google has supported searching for Creative Commons licensed content through the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=29508">usage rights</a> portion of the <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">advanced search interface</a> for some time.  Last week they took the next logical step by <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/2008/04/searching-for-creative-commons-licensed.html">announcing</a> on the <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/">Custom Search blog</a> that you can now use the indexed license information to filter results in your own <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse/">custom search engine</a>.  </p>
<p>Custom search engines allow you to create a search for a set of sites and host it on your site.  This improvement allows you to further restrict your results to resources marked as under a Creative Commons license.  The <a href="http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/2008/04/searching-for-creative-commons-licensed.html">announcement</a> also enumerates how Google looks for CC licenses, although content creators needn't worry about that aspect -- the HTML generated by the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license">license engine</a> contains all the bits you need; just copy and paste!</p>
<p>Thanks, Google!</p>
