<p>Today Creative Commons launched the <a href="http://creativecommons.net">Creative Commons Network</a>, as part of their  annual fundraising campaign. </p>
<p>The CC Network offers users a profile and web badge, providing a means to express support of Creative Commons.  The site also acts as a testbed for digital copyright registry technology. CC Network users may list their Creative Commons licensed works on their CC Network profile. The profile and web badge include metadata corresponding to the license used, allowing applications to consume information about the provenance of licensed works and licensors. Creative Commonsâ€™ own website is one such application and now displays provenance information on license web pages if available. </p>
<p>Creative Commons CTO Nathan Yergler said â€œThe CC Network is where the semantic rubber meets the web roadâ€, referring to the high expectations and underwhelming adoption of Semantic Web technologies. Yergler continued â€œWith the CC Network weâ€™re leveraging everything weâ€™ve learned over the past five years about metadata on the web, including the new RDFa standard, along with the work of many other groups, including FOAF, POWDER, and SIOC.â€ </p>
<p>CC Network accounts also come with an OpenID login, allowing users to login to sites that support OpenID via a trusted provider. The CC Network aims to raise the bar for OpenID providers by taking all steps necessary to protect usersâ€™ privacy. â€œAn OpenID provider knows every site a user logs into via OpenID, so it is important for a user to be able to trust their OpenID provider. We hope users think Creative Commons is trustworthy, but weâ€™re also taking steps to bake user protections into the CC Networkâ€™s OpenID provider implementation, from the technology to terms of service to explanation of the risks and benefits to usersâ€ said security expert Ben Adida, a technology advisor to Creative Commons. </p>
<p>All of the standards the CC Network builds on are open, and the code that runs the site is free software. â€œThe CC Network launch is a step toward a system of interoperable digital copyright registries as open as the web itself. Open registries allow users to discover more information about who's licensing content, and as such are a necessary complement to our open copyright licensesâ€ explained Creative Commons CEO Joi Ito.  </p>
<p>CC Network accounts are offered as a <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">benefit</a> for annual CC supporters at a level of $50 or above ($25 for students). Creative Commonsâ€™ annual fundraising campaign, themed â€œBuild the Commonsâ€, has a goal of raising $500,000 as well as encouraging CC supporters to lead by example, educate others about the value of the CC approach to openness and access, and to help launch the CC Network. </p>

<p><strong>About Creative Commons</strong> </p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach. Creative Commons was built with and is sustained by the generous support of organizations including the Center for the Public Domain, Omidyar Network, The Rockefeller Foundation, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, as well as members of the public.
