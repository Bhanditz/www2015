<p><a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/">J.D. Lasica</a> has a new feature in the online magazine Mindjack entitled "<a href="http://www.mindjack.com/feature/killingfields.html">The Killing Fields: Copyright Law and its Challengers.</a>" It's an overview of Jed Horowitz' struggles with Disney and his film about overreaching copyright, <a href="http://www.willfulinfringement.com/">Willful Infringement</a>. An snippet from the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>At various points, the iconoclastic Horowitz appears on camera, appearing dumbfounded at the tales of a preschool director who said she received letters warning that the school could not show videos to her young charges without a license or hang protected cartoon characters on the walls without permission. He also interviews members of a Rolling Stones tribute band who perform under a legal cloud and husband-and-wife party clowns in Anaheim, California, who were warned not to create balloon animals for kids that looked too much like Tigger, Barney, or the Aladdin genie.</p></blockquote>
