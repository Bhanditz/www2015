<p><a href="http://winksite.com">WINKsite</a>, a publishing and community platform that helps creators bring their content into the mobile environment, has recently launched the <a href="http://winksite.com/site/help_bl_view.cfm?blog_id=4065">Creative Commons Mobile Library</a>, containing Creative Commons licensed works that can be viewed from mobile devices. The initial group of content contains a selection of books licensed under Creative Commons licenses, and is set to experience rapid growth because publishers now have the option to choose a Creative Commons license when enabling their content for mobile viewing. This is expanding Creative Commons into a HUGE new domain: first the Web, then file-sharing, and now Creative Commons on your mobile device. Go WINKsite!</p>
