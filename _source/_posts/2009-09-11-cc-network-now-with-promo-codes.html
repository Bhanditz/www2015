<p><a href="http://www.creativecommons.net"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15001" title="CC Network Logo" src="img/picture-24.png" alt="CC Network Logo" width="218" height="59" /></a>One thing Nathan and John have been working on under the hood of the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.net">Creative Commons Network</a> over the last couple of months is a promotional code system which gives us (and you) more flexibility when purchasing account subscriptions.</p>
<p>Starting today, when you <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/join">donate $50 or more to Creative Commons ($25 for students)</a>, you'll be sent an e-mail with a link will let you either renew your current CC Network account, or sign up with a new one. </p>
<p>This promo code can be used by you, or if you want, you can gift it to a friend by just forwarding them the email with the link. </p>
<p> Just remember, individual promo codes can only be used once so use them wisely!</p>
