<p>Blogger and Director of Content Development @ <a href="http://blip.tv">blip.tv</a>, <a href="http://worshiptheglitch.com/">Eric Mortensen</a>, does a fantastic job of curating high resolution Creative Commons licensed photos. He uses Flickr's '<a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/favorites/">Favorite</a>' function in an innovative way -- all the work he favorites gets pushed to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hiresphotoartistblog">a RSS feed that you can subscribe to</a>. Here's a clip of the gallery he's been curating for a while, with over 600 images, almost all licensed under CC: </p>

<p>Thank Eric, for showing how easy it is to showcase and curate the commons.</p>
