<a href="http://creativecommons.nl/nieuws/?p=275">CC Netherlands released</a> an <a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl/dvd/">all-CC CD+DVD</a> today. <a href="http://www.burobjorn.nl/blog/?p=163">Bjorn Wijers writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.nl/nieuws/?p=275">Creative Commons Netherlands</a> has released the physical cd/dvd with musical and visual talent from the Lowlands. Iâ€™ve been one of the people behind this project and I can assure you this was one of my most difficult projects Iâ€™ve ever done. Although weâ€™ve made some mistakes and had some setbacks, Iâ€™m more than happy with the outcome. I wasnâ€™t the only one working on this off course. It certainly could not have been done without the help of various people:</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://marcoraaphorst.nl/2006/12/12/de-creative-commons-cd-mastering-de-masters/">Marco Raaphorst for the excellent mastering</a> (although I forgot to mention this on the package, sorry Marco!!!!), thanks Guno and Sander for helping us with the difficult task of picking a mere thirteen songs from more than a 130(!) songs sent in by more than 50(!) different artists. Thanks to <a href="http://www.waag.org/persoon/paul">Paul Keller</a> and <a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/nl/mensen/syb/index.html">Syb Groeneveld</a> (public projectleaders of Creative Commons Netherlands) for making this project a reality, thanks to <a href="http://jobjorisenmarieke.nl/">JobJorisenMarieke</a> for doing a great job with the graphical and dvd design, thanks to <a href="http://www.tapes.com/">Tapes</a> for an excellent printing and pressing job and last but not least thanks to all the participating creatives on this cd/dvd! Without your work there wasnâ€™t a cd/dvd!</p>
