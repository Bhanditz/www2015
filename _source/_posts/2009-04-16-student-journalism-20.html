<p>Never has it become more plainly evident that the old model of news reporting---reporting via professional print media to the people---is crumbling, as one by one newspapers across the country shut down. We can lament these long-standing institutions, wax poetic for the "good old days", or we can actually do something about it. </p>
<p>The solution is not to throw money at the problem, because money doesn't force people to read what they don't want to. The solution is to engage actively with the new forms of media out there, and to explore why the web and "new" media are replacing print news. Where does it all start, and what are the advantages of web journalism?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.5104329/k.87/DML_Competition_2009.htm">MacArthur Foundation in partnership with HASTAC</a> (Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Advanced Collaboratory) has awarded $2 million to nineteen projects spanning the globe and innovations in <em><a href="http://www.dmlcompetition.net/">digital media and learning</a></em>. One of these projects is <strong>Student Journalism 2.0</strong>, spearheaded by ccLearn. From the <a href="http://www.dmlcompetition.net/winners.php">competition website</a>,</p>
<p>"For journalism students, the digital age requires more than hands-on reporting, writing, and publication of stories. Students must also embrace the capabilities of the Internet for virtual collaboration, viral dissemination, and feedback loops that inform and deepen original stories. All of these web-based opportunities depend on knowledge and proactive application of open content licensing, such as with Creative Commons, and appropriate metatags and technical formats. Student Journalism 2.0 engages high school students in understanding legal and technical issues intrinsic to new journalistic practices. The lessons learned during this pilot project will be documented in anticipation of a national-scale, follow-up project."</p>
<p>ccLearn's Executive Director, Ahrash Bissell, is currently accepting the grant in Chicago at the awards ceremony and the projects showcase of <a href="http://www.dmlcompetition.net/1/winners.php">last year's Digital Media and Learning Competition winners</a>. The event runs through tomorrow, and you can read the <a href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.5104329/k.87/DML_Competition_2009.htm">full press release here</a>. </p>
<p>We wrote the proposal sometime last year, got enmeshed in the daily grind of other projects and work, and forgot about it. Spring brought fantastic news, and we would like to give our greatest thanks to the MacArthur Foundation, HASTAC, and everyone else involved in making this possible. We will keep you posted as the project develops. For now, you can read the original <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/student-journalism-2-0">project proposal</a> at the ccLearn site, licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, of course.</p>
