<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/search-engines-united.html">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000380.html">Yahoo!</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2006/11/15/microsoft-google-yahoo-unite-to-support-sitemaps.aspx">Microsoft</a> have united to publish the <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">Sitemap Protocol</a> under the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Attribution-ShareAlike license</a>.</p>
<p>Sitemaps provide a way for webmasters to tell search engines how to crawl and index websites more intelligently. Obviously it is a huge win for search engines and webmasters if all agree to use the same protocol.</p>
<p>This is just a guess, but I imagine that agreeing to release the protocol under a CC license saved Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft many hours of legal haggling over copyright in the protocol. It is not a guess that this decision allows anyone, e.g., non-incumbent search engines, to publish and extend the protocol, without asking for permission from the incumbents.</p>
<p>Adding to the commons is win-win for current and future players, large and small. Don't forget that Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">needs your support</a> to continue providing and developing licenses and tools that create an environment where win-win solutions for large and small are not only available, but the obvious right thing to do. In this too, <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/Google_donates_30_000_to_CC">follow Google's lead</a>. :)</p>
