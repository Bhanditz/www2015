<p><img src="img/jamendo.jpg" alt="jamendo" title="jamendo" width="303" height="79" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />Last month, <a href="http://pro.jamendo.com/en/">Jamendo PRO</a> and the <a href="http://www.ih-ra.com/">International Hotel & Restaurant Association</a> (IH&RA) announced a new partnership that will bring Jamendo PRO's vast catalog of CC-licensed music to IH&RA members for use as background music. </p>
<p>IH&RA members comprise around 300,000 hotels and 8 million restaurants, making this an incredible case study for how CC-licensed content can be monetized on a large scale. Artists that distribute their music through Jamendo PRO will receive half of the revenue generated from the licensing - these are the same artists who use <a href="http://jamendo.com/">Jamendo</a>, the open music sharing site, to distribute CC-licensed recordings for free to the public under CC-licenses of their choosing.</p>
