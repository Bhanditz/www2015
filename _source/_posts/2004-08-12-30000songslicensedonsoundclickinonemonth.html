<p> <a href="http://soundclick.com">Soundclick</a>, one of the Internet's biggest music community sites,  prominently integrated our license engine just one month ago.  In that time, over <a href="<br />
http://www.soundclick.com/genres/cc_license.cfm">30,000 tracks</a> have been licensed under Creative Commons licenses.  Genres vary, and many of the tracks allow derivatives, so break out your music editing software and mix away.</p>
