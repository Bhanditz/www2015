<p><a href="http://buckyjonson">Bucky Jonson</a> is the name of the band that drives the funky soul behind the multi-platinum Grammy winning band the <strong>Black Eyed Peas</strong>. The band is actually made up of Printz Board, George Pajon Jr., Tim Izo and Keith Harris. A few months ago they stepped out from the shadows with their oh-so-appropriately named solo album "<a href="http://bbemusic.com/data.pl?release=BBEMP3083">The Band Behind the Front...</a>."</p>
<p>Now for the real news: The album's individual solo tracks along with many outtakes have been made available with a BY-NC license at <a href="http://ccmixter.org/buckyjonson">ccMixter.org/buckyjonson</a>.</p>
<p>Bucky represents some of the best soul/funk virtuoso musicians on the scene today so it's no surprise that these recording are the cleanest, best originally performed samples ever put into the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5784">Creative Commons Sample Pool</a> (which is approaching the 50,000 sample count). There was so much material delivered from the band it took a <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/thread/1247">small army of volunteers</a> from the ccMixter community to chop the tracks into bite-size remix-able loops. Over 205 MB of un-cut tracks and the loops are available for <a href="http://ccmixter.org/buckyjonson">free download here</a>.</p>
<p>The release of these tracks is part of an ongoing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/2007/09/creative-commons-and-bbe-music-collaborate-on-release-of-remixable-dj-vadim-tracks/">relationship between CC and BBE Music</a> that includes the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/djvadim">DJ Vadim remix contest</a> and subsequent <a href="http://ccmixter.org/bbe">release of Vadmin's album into the Commons</a>. The winners of that contest were put onto the "<a href="http://www.bbemusic.com/data.pl?release=BBECD082">Soundcatchers Extras</a>" album along side Vadim and other members of the worldwide consortium of musicians and DJ operating under the banner of the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/0neself">One-self Collective</a>.</p>
<p>The best remixes posted to ccMixter of Bucky and Vadim continue to be culled for other One-self projects including live dates around the world, soundtracks for videos and playing them on the BBE radio shows in London and Spain. </p>
