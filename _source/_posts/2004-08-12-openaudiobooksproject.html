<p>
We've seen a couple audiobook projects popup around Creative Commons licensed books recently (<a href="http://webjay.org/by/lucas_gonze/lessigfreecultureaudiobookproject">Lessig's audiobook</a> and <a href="http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=opensource_audio&collectionid=DOMK">Doctorow's audiobook</a>), but <a href="http://www.audhumla.org/openaudiobooks/">this new Open Audiobooks Project</a> aims to collect recordings of public domain books. They're kicking off the project by recording Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. If you're a fan of the book, have a good voice, and want to contribute to the project, sign on their site.</p>
