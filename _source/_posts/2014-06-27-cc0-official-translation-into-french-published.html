<p>CC0 now has an <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.fr" title="CC0 French">official translation into French</a>. This is the second translation of CC0, and also only the second official translation of any CC legal tool (following <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/42397">CC0 in Dutch</a>, published earlier this year).</p>
<p>There are many people who deserve congratulations on this accomplishment. This is often the case for translation projects, but it is especially true with French! According to the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy">translation policy</a> for our legal tools, we will be publishing only one official translation per languageâ€”for all of its speakers worldwide. This isn't so difficult for some languages, which are primarily spoken in only one country. But with French-speaking countries around the world, many teams had to take part in this project so that the final text works for everyone, even across regional variations in language. </p>
<p>CC France did the tremendous task of leading the effort, coordinating their own team as well as others from Algeria, Belgium, Cameroon, Canada, Luxembourg, Morocco, Senegal, Switzerland, Tunisia, and collaborators from <a href="http://www.framasoft.org">Framasoft.org</a> and <a href="http://venividilibre.org">VeniVidiLibre.org</a>. </p>
<p>The CC0 translations, as well as the upcoming translations of 4.0, are as close as possible to the original English, keeping the same legal meaning. Under our new <a href"http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy">translation policy, these will all be considered equivalent: anyone linking to the legal code may use any language. We think everyone should be able to understand the legal tools theyâ€™re using, and toward that end, we put a lot of thought into simplifying the language in 4.0. But it should be true in a language everyone can read--and thanks to the translation efforts of our affiliates, we are coming closer to this goal.</p>
<p>There are many more translation projects of CC0 and of 4.0 in progress; expect to see more announcements in the coming months! (You can take a look at the list of projects <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_Tools_Translation#Translations_in_progress">in progress</a>.) To get involved with an existing translation project or begin a new one, please see the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy">translation policy</a> for information on getting started. </p>
