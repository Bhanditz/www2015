<p><a href="http://www.homelessoutcomes.org.uk/About_the_Outcomes_Star.aspx">The Outcomes Star System</a> is a "tool for measuring the outcomes of work with homeless people," specifically designed for use by homeless charities. The Outcomes Star System focuses on "an approach to measuring change" on 10 different criteria, the theory being that by following The Outcomes Star System, outreach to the homeless can be approached with pragmatism and a level of success.</p>
