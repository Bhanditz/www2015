<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11045">previously announced</a>, we're running a questionnaire on understanding "NonCommercial" use.  The questionnaire runs through December <s>7</s><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11298">14</a>.  It takes 15-25 minutes to complete.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://ur1.ca/y41">Click here to start the questionnaire.</a></b></p>
<p>Your input is greatly appreciated. CC CEO Joi Ito <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9557">explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>â€œThe study has direct relevance to Creative Commonsâ€™ mission of providing free, flexible copyright licenses that are easy to understand and simple to use,â€ said Creative Commons CEO Joi Ito. â€œThe NC term is a popular option for creators choosing a Creative Commons license, and that tells us the term meets a need. However, as exponentially increasing numbers of works are made available under CC licenses, we want to provide additional information for creators about the contexts in which the NC term may further or impede their intentions with respect to the works they choose to share, and we want to make sure that users clearly understand those intentions. We expect the study findings will help us do a better job of explaining the licenses and to improve them, where possible. We also hope the findings, which will be made publicly available, will contribute to better understanding of some of the complexities of digital distribution of content.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>You can also help by sending your friends and colleagues to the questionnaire.</p>

<p>If you don't have time to help CC in this way, remember that we're <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">in the midst of our annual fundraising campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Contributing in both ways would be ideal. :-)</p>
<p>CC licenses are an <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/12/change-gov-content-now-under-creative-commons-lice">important</a><sup>*</sup> part of the digital infrastructure and debate. Your financial contributions and your feedback are both crucial to the ongoing development of this infrastructure.</p>

<p><small><sup>*</sup> The 'important' link above points out a recent extraordinarily important and visible use of the CC BY license, which does not include the NC term. As Joi points out in the quote above, we also want to provide information about contexts in which NC is not appropriate. So please <a href="http://ur1.ca/y41">take the questionnaire</a> if you care about public copyright licenses, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051">even if</a> you don't like or don't use ones with the NonCommercial term. Thanks!</small></p>
