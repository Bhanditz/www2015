<p>There is <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/creativebusiness/index.php/John_Buckman:_Magnatune">an incredibly comprehensive and informative profile</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Buckman">John Buckman</a>, founder of <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>, at the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/creativebusiness/index.php/Main_Page">Open Rights Group wiki</a>. The profile contains an immense amount of information, outlining the motivation behind Magnatune, Buckman's thoughts on the future of the music industry, and a bevy of info regarding Magnatune and CC. Consider it the most in depth <a href="http://creativecommons.org/commoners">Featured Commoner</a> piece ever committed to HTML, and we didn't even create it.</p>
