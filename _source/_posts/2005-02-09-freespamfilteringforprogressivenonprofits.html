<p>Marc Perkel is offering <a href="http://marc.perkel.com/archives/000677.html">free spam filtering for progressive nonprofit organizations</a> (more info <a href="http://www.junkemailfilter.com/nonprofit.html">here</a>).  Creative Commons has been using his service since last summer.  I don't get much spam delivered to my creativecommons.org inbox.</p>
<p>Thanks Marc!</p>
