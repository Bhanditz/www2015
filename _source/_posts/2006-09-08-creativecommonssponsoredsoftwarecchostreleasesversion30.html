<p><b>San Francisco, USA - September 8, 2006<br />
</b></p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides flexible<br />
copyright licenses for authors and artists along with the Creative<br />
Commons Developer Community released the ccHost 3.0 today. ccHost is an<br />
Open Source web-based media sharing software. This major feature release<br />
comes on the heals of winning the Linux Journal Linux World Expo Award<br />
for "Best Open Source Solution" and combines approximately five months of<br />
development, usage, and testing into packages that anyone may download,<br />
install, and use to empower on-line media sharing communities. This<br />
release builds upon ccHost's novel support of collaboration, sharing,<br />
and storage of multi-media using the different Creative Commons licenses<br />
and metadata.</p>
<p>These features most notably show up and are tested in Creative Commons'<br />
project, ccMixter (<a href="http://www.ccmixter.org/">www.ccmixter.org</a>), a popular on-line social network<br />
service that supports legal music sharing and remixing. ccHost is the<br />
Open Source Software engine powering ccmixter.org and which anyone may<br />
download, install, and use to freely build media sharing communities.</p>
<p>Ryan Lerch, a developer from the project Open Clip Art Library<br />
(<a href="http://www.openclipart.org/">www.openclipart.org</a>) says, "the new release of ccHost now includes<br />
features that we have wanted for some time. It now integrates powerful<br />
features that will enhance both the usability and efficiency of the Open<br />
Clip Art Library and will help us immensely in our goal of creating<br />
a comprehensive library of public domain clip art." The Open Clip Art<br />
Library is but one of several projects moving their projects to use the<br />
solid infrastructure ccHost provides.</p>
<p>Major features in this release include native forums, infrastructure to<br />
support multiple languages, and an e-mail notification system. ccHost<br />
has replaced its dependency on phpbb2 with native fully-functioning<br />
hierarchical forums. They are totally integrated with user profiles and<br />
administrators may specifically control them.</p>
<p>ccHost now supports multiple languages. There is new integration of<br />
the standard Open Source GNU gettext-based multi-language support<br />
tools. This allows for initial support for Italian, German, Mainland<br />
Chinese, Taiwanese Chinese, and Brazilian Portuguese in addition to<br />
English. The project encourages others to get involved in order to<br />
translate ccHost into more local languages.</p>
<p>A user-requested feature now implemented is e-mail notifications. It<br />
allows registered users to get e-mail whey they have been reviewed,<br />
rated, remixed, or when someone else has uploaded a file and they want<br />
to be alerted.</p>
<p>Other important features include recent reviews for the sidebars, the<br />
'How I Did It' browser sorting, and tons of statistics. Stats include<br />
number of reviews for uploads, an overview of forum messages, and times<br />
remixed, all to help a community know about itself. ccHost also supports<br />
XSPF 1.0 playlists as feeds, basic support for the new getid3 SVG module,<br />
and dumping of content from ccHost to a large feed file format (useful<br />
for search engines and external parsing).</p>
<p>ccHost makes the lives of administrators much easier by adding an<br />
FTP-less file manager, a Bayesian rating scheme, sub-navigation tabs,<br />
spam flood protection, and setting of file-permissions. External to<br />
the core ccHost application are also several command line scripts<br />
which admins can use to powerfully help them in their maintenance<br />
of an installation. Of particular note is the inclusion of code from<br />
Brazil-based Bruno Dilly's Google Summer of Code project into a tool<br />
called "publishcchost" which allows one to publish a file to any ccHost<br />
installation from the command line.</p>
<p>This release also focuses on addressing compatibility with modern ways<br />
software is installed on the web. ccHost 3.0 fully supports PHP 5 and<br />
has been tested thoroughly in shared hosting setups on Dreamhost and<br />
Freedesktop.org. Also, one outstanding bug has been squashed in that<br />
ccHost does not require getid3 for installation.</p>
<p>The ccHost development community encourages new developers to<br />
contribute to the project. The future of ccHost is bright with upcoming<br />
development focusing on user and admin requests for features like further<br />
generalization of media support, better tools to support social networking<br />
features, and further language support.</p>

<p>About ccHost</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to spread media content that is licensed<br />
under Creative Commons throughout the web in much the same way that<br />
weblogs spread CC licensed text. ccHost is web-based infrastructure that<br />
may be used to host and allow for commenting, remixing, and distribution<br />
globally. The more installations of ccHost and its variations, the more<br />
content there will be available for enjoyment and artistic re-use in a<br />
sane and legal setting. ccHost is what is used for the infamous Creative<br />
Commons ccMixter project, which supports legal media sharing and remixing.</p>
<p>About Creative Commons</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that promotes the creative<br />
re-use of intellectual and artistic works - whether owned or in the<br />
public domain. Creative Commons licenses provide a flexible range of<br />
protections and freedoms that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept<br />
of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved"<br />
approach. Creative Commons is sustained by the generous support of various<br />
foundations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,<br />
the Omidyar Network Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller<br />
Foundation, as well as members of the public.</p>
