<p>One of the benefits of public domain books is that once they are scanned and made available on the Internet, they are then available for anyone, including other organizations, to use and reuse in other contexts and sites. The <a href="http://prospector.coalliance.org">Prospector Alliance</a>, the union catalog of Colorado Alliance Research Libraries, did exactly this by enhancing the bibliographic records of the University of Michigan's giant collection of digitized public domain books. According to the <a href="http://www.coalliance.org/prospector/p_news/HathiTrustpressreleaseApr2009.htm">press release</a>,</p>
<p>"Library users in Colorado and Wyoming now have access to tens of thousands of additional open-access digitized books and serials through the Prospector Library Catalog (http://prospector.coalliance.org). The digitized items originate from the University of Michigan, a partner in the Google Books digitization project and a member of a consortium of libraries called <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ls">Hathi Trust</a>. Last year the University of Michigan made available bibliographic records for many of the out-of-copyright titles that Google digitized from its collections. The University then made available online files for each of the digitized works.</p>
<p>...Now library patrons from across Colorado have access to the online books via the Prospector catalog. Except for the University of Michigan where the books originated, the Auraria Library was the first library in the nation to make these books available to its users."</p>
