<p>This week's featured content is a new site called <a href="http://www.wikitravel.org">WikiTravel</a> that takes an innovative, community approach to sharing travel information. The site is based on a <a href="http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki">Wiki</a>, which is a bit of web software that allows anyone to edit and create new pages, giving a community of interested users the power to expand the content of a site in any direction. Current hot topics include <a href="http://www.wikitravel.org/article/Tips_for_flying">a great set of tips on flying</a> and <a href="http://www.wikitravel.org/article/Driving_in_Australia">tips for driving in Australia</a>.</p>

To go along with the multi-author, community spirit of the site, the contents are licensed under a Creative Commons license, allowing anyone to reprint, modify, and even use the content commercially.</p>
