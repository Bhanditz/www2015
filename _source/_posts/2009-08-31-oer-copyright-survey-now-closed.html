<p>Thanks to all of you who filled out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/16968">OER Copyright Survey</a>! The survey is now closed, with many thoughtful responses. Again, we appreciate your responses, among which was an overarching request to have the survey translated. We definitely hope and intend to broaden the survey to more countries and in more languages in the future, and are open to ideas and support. Please <a href="mailto:cclearn-info@creativecommons.org">contact us</a> if you, an individual you know, or a project/organization you are in touch with is interested in participating in the next stages of research. Participation can be anything from simply responding to the survey in your own language or helping to translate, organize, or analyze the data.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please take advantage of the <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Copyright_exceptions_%28fair_use%29_and_OER_production">user group</a> currently active on <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/">OpenEd</a> to continue the discussion. Also feel free to review and contribute to the <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/Open_Ed_2009_CEL_survey_notes">survey notes</a>.</p>
