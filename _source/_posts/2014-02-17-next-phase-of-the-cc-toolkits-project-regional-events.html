<p>Back in November, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40228">launched</a> the <a href="http://cctoolkits.com">CC Toolkits</a> project with the aim of invigorating the CC Community through affiliate events. CC Argentina collaborated with Wikimedia Argentina to hack out a template for the toolkits during a sprint, creating a starting point for just about anyone to collect open content about CC, and publish it on the web.</p>

<h3>Building momentum for sharing resources about CC</h3>
<p>This month, affiliate groups in Argentina, Paraguay, Nigeria, and Poland will be running local events bringing people together around openness in law, government, education, and cultural works. Though the events will be about much more than open copyright licenses, volunteers in our community will be sprinting and hacking to gathering  and create useful videos, guides, and other content on the web that make it easy for others to learn about the importance of CC. </p>

<p>The toolkit template developed by the design team is composed of a Wordpress theme built from the ground up, with media panes for embedding and linking and viewing content about CC that various affiliate groups have created. The goal is make it easier for creators and curators in the CC community to frame interesting and useful content into toolkits that can support conversations about CC. But beyond the tech, the regional events happening this month will help set the stage for new ways we can share about open.</p>
<p><b>Here is a rundown of events being run by affiliates this month:</b></p>
