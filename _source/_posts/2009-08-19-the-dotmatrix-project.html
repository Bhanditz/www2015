<p><img src="img/logo.gif" alt="logo" title="logo" width="200" height="51" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />The <a href="http://www.dotmatrixproject.com/">dotmatrix project</a> is a "collective of musicians, photographers, videographers & sound engineers" who organize, promote, and document monthly shows in Greensboro, North Carolina. DMP subsequently archive these shows online, distributing hi-quality <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thedotmatrixproject">videos</a>, <a href="http://beta.amiestreet.com/search/drilldown?type=ALBUM&query=live+at+the+dotmatrix+project">audio</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thedotmatrixproject/">photos</a> from the shows under a<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/"> CC BY-NC-SA license</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.dotmatrixproject.com/thinking-about-ccommunity/">recent post</a> on the DMP blog provides ample reasoning for their community's commitment - a sincere love for the music being made in Greensboro and a desire to share these local talents with a broader audience. By releasing all of the digital archives under a CC-license, the DMP legally enables this sort of sharing while allowing the media created to be re-used as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Essentially, weâ€™ve designed the parameters of our project to allow 16-year old Billy Nelson in Austin, Texas to mashup a track by The Bronzed Chorus with one by Laurelyn Dossett, while using DMP show pictures to use as b-roll for the music video [...] I want to welcome a â€œBillyâ€ with open arms into the DMP collective without even a hint of stodginess or protectionism. The same goes to a blogger who embeds our media in a post to expose the talent of the artists involved.</p></blockquote>
<p>To learn more about the DMP, upcoming events, and learn more about the shows they have put on be sure to check out <a href="http://www.dotmatrixproject.com/about/">their website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/spcoon">Sean</a> from the DMP points out that while music is the focus of their formula, it wouldn't exist with out the incredible efforts of their local media crew. As such, they hold bi-annual photo exhibits, with the next one happening in just a few weeks on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thedotmatrixproject/3815003441/sizes/l/">September 4th</a>!</p>
