<p>At <a href="http://extranet.cccco.edu/SystemOperations/BoardofGovernors/Meetings/September2013Agenda.aspx">today's meeting</a> of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, the Board voted unanimously to require open licensing on publicly funded materials resulting from all <a href="http://extranet.cccco.edu/">Chancellor's Office</a> contracts and grants.  </p>
<p>The previous policy for these grants maintained 'all rights reserved' copyright over grant materials by the Chancellor's Office; the <a href="http://extranet.cccco.edu/Portals/1/ExecutiveOffice/Board/2013_agendas/september/2_1_p_and_s_changes.pdf">exact language</a> (PDF) reading, "The copyright for all materials first produced as a result of this Work for Hire agreement shall belong to the Chancellor's Office." </p>
<p>Upon reviewing the existing policy, and discussing the benefits of open licensing for publicly funded materials, the Board of Governors voted to adjust its policy so that any works created under contracts or grants funded by the California Community Colleges Chancellorâ€™s Office will be made available under the <a href="/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a> (CC BY) license. </p>
<p>The Chancellor's Office will maintain its copyright over grant and contract funded materials, while enabling wide dissemination, reuse, and adaptation of those materials under the CC BY license. With 72 districts and 112 colleges, the California Community Colleges is the largest system of higher education in world to now require a CC BY license on its publicly funded grant materials.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/Portals/0/DocDownloads/PressReleases/SEP2013/PRESS_RELEASE_CreativeCommonsBY_090913_FINAL.pdf">press release</a> (PDF),</p>
<blockquote><p>
Using a CC BY license also saves taxpayers money by not funding duplicate work that may only be accessible on the local level. For instance, under the old grant requirements a community college staff may have produced a report under contract from the Chancellorâ€™s Office but was not required to openly license or share that report with other colleges. This made it difficult for other colleges to access and reuse the report, but with the new CC BY requirement, other colleges can both view the report and reuse, share, and improve upon it with updated information and data.<br />
<br />
"The Chancellor's Office already held copyrights to all materials that had been contracted," California Community Colleges Chancellor Brice W. Harris said. "But the great thing about the action taken by the board of governors this afternoon is that those materials will now be available to a world-wide audience. Also, the tax-paying public shouldn't be required to pay twice or more to access and use educational materials, first via the funding of the research and development of educational resources and then again when they purchase materials like textbooks they helped fund. So, ultimately this decision to change the board's regulations will save taxpayers money over time. That's always a good thing."</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean Florez, President and CEO of the 20 Million Minds Foundation added:</p>
<blockquote><p>"These are exciting times as the California Community Colleges takes the lead in advancing higher education. Creative Commons licensing saves families and taxpayers money and the advancement of Open Educational Resources further expands access to materials for faculty members and their students."</p></blockquote>

Creative Commons is thrilled with this recent development and hopes this new policy by the California Community Colleges inspires other college systems to also implement open policies for their grants and contracts.</p>
<p>Thank you, California Community Colleges for ensuring publicly funded educational resources are openly licensed.</p>
