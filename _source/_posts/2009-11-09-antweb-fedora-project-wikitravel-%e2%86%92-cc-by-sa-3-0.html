<p>Demonstrating that June's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411">migration of Wikimedia sites</a> to CC Attribution-ShareAlike as their main content liense was a signal of much greater interoperability among free and open content projects going forward and not merely an end in itself are recent announcements from the Fedora Project, AntWeb, and Wikitravel, all moved or moving to CC BY-SA 3.0. Each has a different story as to how and why they made the move.</p>
<p>The <b><a href="https://fedoraproject.org">Fedora Project</a></b>, best known for its community-centric and cutting-edge GNU/Linux distribution, but also committed to "leading the advancement of free, open software <em>and content</em>" (emphasis added, from the Fedora Project home page), has <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Relicensing_OPL_to_CC_BY_SA">migrated all of its documentation and wiki content</a> to CC BY-SA from the long-deprecated <a rel="tag" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Publication_License">Open Publication License</a>, via their contributor agreement. Among the reasons:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>4.  Other organizations that have content we can reuse in Fedora and contribute back to, such as Wikipedia and GNOME, have switched or are switching to the CC BY SA. Why does this matter? For one easy example, we can write a definitive history of Fedora, host it on Wikipedia as the upstream, then package it as part of the â€˜about-fedoraâ€™ package.</p>
<p>5. If youâ€™ve never looked at how much open content there is on e.g. flickr.com and Wikicommons, please look. For content authors, this is going from practically zero useful open media available to tens of millions of photographs, diagrams, and so forth that we can not only freely reuse, but we can contribute back to.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.antweb.org">AntWeb</a></b>, a project of the California Academy of Sciences that holds its own copyrights has changed its license from CC Attribution-NonCommercial to CC Attribution-ShareAlike, a change that has resulted in a major collaboration with Wikimedians and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_AntWeb">30,000 ant images</a> gracing Wikipedia articles. Waldir Pimenta guest-blogging with Brianna Laugher, <a href="http://brianna.modernthings.org/article/241/guest-antweb-goes-cc-by-sa">writes</a>:<br />

<p>I found <a href="http://www.antweb.org/bigPicture.jsp?code=CASENT0005712&amp;name=Pogonomyrmex%20maricopa&amp;picture=/images/casent0005712/casent0005712_p_1_high.jpg">the</a> <a href="http://www.antweb.org/bigPicture.jsp?code=CASENT0005712&amp;name=Pogonomyrmex%20maricopa&amp;picture=/images/casent0005712/casent0005712_d_1_high.jpg">fantastic</a> <a href="http://www.antweb.org/bigPicture.jsp?code=CASENT0005712&amp;name=Pogonomyrmex%20maricopa&amp;picture=/images/casent0005712/casent0005712_h_1_high.jpg">images</a> from <a href="http://antweb.org/">AntWeb</a>, a project from <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/">The California Academy of Sciences</a>, which aims to illustrate the enormous diversity of the ants of the world. I was especially happy to find that they were using a Creative Commons license â€” but soon after I was disappointed to find that the specific one they used (CC-BY-NC) was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051">not appropriate for Wikipedia</a> (or, more generally, free cultural works, and thus discouraged by Creative Commons itself).</p>
<p>So I sent them an email suggesting them to change the license. When they replied, I found out that they actuallly had been internally discussing license issues for quite a while. I kept in touch, and made sure to let them know the advantages of having their work showcased in such high-traffic websites as Wikipedia, Commons or WikiSpecies.</p>
<p>I like to think that my two cents helped in their decision, some time later, to not only <strong>change their license to CC-BY-SA</strong>, but also <strong>upload all their images to Commons</strong> themselves! This was part of their overall mission: â€œuniversal access to ant informationâ€. Before, the  AntWeb project focused only on digitization of content and development of the web portal; but now they also decided to â€œexportâ€ AntWeb content to improve access. Putting the images and associated metadata in Commons was an example their outreach initiatives.</p>

<p>Finally, <b><a href="http://wikitravel.org">Wikitravel</a></b>, a very successful site that we've mentioned here many times (see founder Evan Prodromou's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7739">letter in support of our 2007 fundraising campaign</a> -- which also <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">works for 2009!</a>) is <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/License_upgrade">building community consensus for upgrading from CC BY-SA 1.0 to CC BY-SA 3.0</a>. Unfortunately 1.0 did not have an upgrade clause, a problem <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216">corrected</a> in 2.0.</p>
