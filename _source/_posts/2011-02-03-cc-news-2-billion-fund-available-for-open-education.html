<p>CC heads into February with exciting new developments in policy, science, and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>A new U.S. education fund makes available $2 billion to create open educational resources in community colleges</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor and the Department of Education <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20101436.htm" target="_blank">announced</a> a new education fund that will grant $2 billion to create open educational resources (OER) materials for career training programs in community colleges. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grant Program (TAACCCT) will invest $2 billion over the next four years into grants that will â€œprovide community colleges and other eligible institutions of higher education with funds to expand and improve their ability to deliver education and career training programs.â€ What's more, theÂ <a href="http://www.doleta.gov/grants/pdf/SGA-DFA-PY-10-03.pdf" target="_blank">full program announcement</a> (PDF) states that all the resources created using these funds must be released under the Creative Commons Attribution (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0?utm_campaign=newsletter_1102&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">CC BY</a>) license. The first round of funding will be $500 million over the next year. Applications to the solicitation are now open, and will be due April 21, 2011.

<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/npg_/index_npg.html">Nature Publishing Group</a> has long been a leader in scientific and medical publishing. Last month, the company announced a brand new online open access journal called <a href="http://www.nature.com/scientificreports"><em>Scientific Reports</em></a>. With this launch, a full 80% of NPG academic and society journals and 50% of all journals the company publishes offer open access options to authors. Additionally, NPG is going to make a <a href="http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificreports.html">donation to Creative Commons for every publication in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>. We are thrilled to have this financial support that will help us continue to provide the legal and technical infrastructure of open systems.

<p><strong>Al Jazeera adds Egypt and Tunisia coverage to its CC video repository</strong></p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Egyptian uprising on January 25th, Qatar-based all-news Arabic channel Al Jazeera has been feeding its <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">repository of CC-licensed video</a> with up-to-date footage from Egypt and Tunisia. With a powerful network of journalists and reporters on the ground who can provide footage that is sometimes very difficult to obtain, "Al Jazeera has decided to make its content available for other news sources to use through their Creative Commons websiteâ€ (<a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/01/al-jazeera-egypt/">Wired</a>). The footage released on Al Jazeeraâ€™s Creative Commons repository is under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1102&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">CC BY</a> license, which makes it legally available to be downloaded, shared, re-mixed, translated and even re-broadcast without asking for further permission as long as the original source is credited.
