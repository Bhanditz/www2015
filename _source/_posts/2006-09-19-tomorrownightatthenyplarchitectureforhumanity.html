<p>New Yorkers, there's a terrific event happening tomorrow night in your neck of the woods: <a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/pep/pepdesc.cfm?id=2370">Live from the NYPL</a> presents a panel with Cameron Sinclair, Kate Stohr and Cynthia Barton of <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/">Architecture for Humanity</a> (which we profiled as a Featured Commoner <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education/architecture">here</a>) at the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/">NYPL</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hockenberry">John Hockenberry</a> is moderating the discussion which will address how contemporary designers and architects are using their talents to respond to the world's humanitarian crises.</p>
<blockquote><p>As we enter the 21st century the field of architecture is at a crossroads. From Hurricane Katrina to the war in Iraq, large-scale urbanization, disaster and conflict has destabilized not only our political structures but also the built environment prompting many to question the building practices of the past. Is the role of the architect to create the signature monuments that define and exalt our cultural and economic values? Or, is there an alternative path to building in the world today, one that engages people where they live and work and recognizes that sustainability is not a luxury but a necessity?</p></blockquote>
