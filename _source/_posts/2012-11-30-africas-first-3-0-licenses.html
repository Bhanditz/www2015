<p>We are pleased to announce the launch of the Creative Commons 3.0 Uganda licenses. Since joining the Creative Commons family in March of 2011, the Ugandan team has been incredibly busy: hosting the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33267">African Regional Meeting</a>, pulling together petitions for the Pan-African Intellectual Property Organization, and spreading the news about CC licenses. While doing all these great activities, they&#8217;ve also completed one of the last 3.0 ports.</p>
<p>The licenses are available through the <a href="/choose/?field_jurisdiction=ug">license chooser</a>, and like all of our licenses, are intended for use anywhere in the world. The Uganda 3.0 licenses are important as the first 3.0 licenses in Africa and one of the last 3.0 ports before the launch of the new 4.0 licenses.</p>
<p>Creative Commons would like to extend a huge thanks to the whole <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Uganda">CC Uganda team</a>; The National Book Trust of Uganda (NABOTU); the Centre for Health, Human Rights and Development (CEHURD); and especially to Primah Kwagala for leading the porting team.</p>
