<p>It has been suggested that there would be some value in CC entering the field of software licensing. I am skeptical (there are plenty of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_licenses">software licenses</a>) but the explosion of mixed code/content platforms (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a>) has led me to at least get feedback about the idea. So if you have thoughts about this, I'd be grateful if you could send them to <a href="mailto:"software-licensing@creativecommons.org">software-licensing@creativecommons.org.</p>
