<p>We have a long-standing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/embedding">specification</a> for embedding licenses in MP3 audio files which requires two pieces of information: a license claim embeddded in the audio file, and verification metadata hosted on a web page.  While <a href="http://cctools.sourceforge.net">command-line tools</a> for looking up the verification metadata have been available for a while, we have lacked an easy, drag and drop solution for examining an embedded claim and whether or not it verifies.  No more.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&package_id=131329">ccLookup</a> is tool available for Mac OS X and Windows which allows you to drop an MP3 file onto the program icon or running window in order to verify the embedded claim, if any.  Downloads are available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=80503&package_id=131329">here</a>.</p>
<p>While ccLookup is a step in the right direction, there's still work to be done.  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/ogg">Ogg</a> support would be nice, and I'm sure there are features I haven't thought of.  Have a comment, suggestion or idea?  <a href="mailto:nathan@creativecommons.org">Email</a> me at nathan@creativecommons.org and let me know.</p>
