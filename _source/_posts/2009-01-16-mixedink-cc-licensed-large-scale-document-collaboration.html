<p><img src="img/b.gif" alt="b" width="168" height="127" class="alignright size-full wp-image-12250" /><a href="http://wwww.mixedink.com/main.php">MixedInk</a> is a recently launched service that allows large groups of people to collaboratively work on a single document together online. While many sites of this nature exist, MixedInk seems to be the first to focus on large group collaboration and does so in a unique manner. MixedInk's submission system is based on a Digg-like voting procedure in which users vote for their favorite draft - the final draft is therefore dynamic and can shift over time if a better draft is decided upon by the community.</p>
<p>MixedInk keeps this type of collaboration open and legally sound by requiring any documents created on the site to be released under a <a href="http://mixedink.com/faq.php">CC BY-SA license</a>. This serves a practical purpose - the articles written offer no restrictions in regards to quoting or editing as long as the original author is credited - and also serves the auxiliary purpose of keeping the MixedInk community open and free, ensuring there are no legal barriers for creating the best content possible. There are already some interesting examples of how this system can be put to use, most notably <a href="http://mixedink.com/Slate/InauguralAddress">Slate's community written Inaugural Address</a> where individuals can contribute and vote for the Inaguration Speech they would most like to hear President-Elect Barack Obama give this coming Tuesday. The top-rated address will be published at <a href="http://slate.com/">Slate.com</a> on inauguration day.</p>
