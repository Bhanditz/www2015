<p>Indaba Music, the online digital music remix platform and community has just revamped its session console with access to TKTKTKTs of Creative Commons licensed loops, all professionally recorded. This means </p>
<p>The clips library that we launched has hundreds of audio clips right in the Console - all high quality and created by professional musicians and all licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0. We'll be continuously adding to the library with high quality clips and will eventually open up the platform for anyone to contribute clips. We've also been talking with Victor about integrating our database with the CC Mixter library and enabling users of both communities to tap into both libraries. We're excited to get that rolling now that this launch is up and running.</p>
