All sorts of interesting things show up in our <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23cc+OR+%40creativecommons+OR+creativecommons+OR+%22creative+commons%22+OR+%22CC+License%22">Twitter search feed</a>, and yesterday we were thrilled to come across <a href="http://www.cadyou.com">Cadyou</a> via <a href="http://twitter.com/sketchupshop">@sketchupshop</a>. Cadyou is a community launched by <a href="http://tommoor.com/">Tom Moor</a> in late 2008 whose goal is to create a resource of free, high quality files for everyone to use, available in the Public Domain and under Creative Commons licenses.   One interesting component of Cadyou's content is its moderation policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Unlike many websites which let user upload their own content, cadyou is moderated ensuring that each file made available reaches quality standards, is tagged well and has great thumbnails so it is easy to find what you need. </p></blockquote>
