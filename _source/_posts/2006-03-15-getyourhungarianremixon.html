<p>You only have two weeks left to <a href="http://remix.creativecommons.hu/english/index.html">upload</a> your remix of the Hungarian band Nomada's song Aven le Roma! â€“ Here come the Roma!. The five-member group <a href="http://nomada.hu/">Nomada</a> was founded by Roma singer-guitarist Balogh GusztÃ¡v in 2003. Nomadaâ€™s music is derived from the Hungarian Gypsy tradition in addition to drawing from other musical styles such as Spanish, Arabic and Serbian folk elements.</p>
<p>Nomada have released their song Aven le Roma! â€“ Here come the Roma!, and its component elements, under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license which authorizes members of the public to remix it. To be considered as part of the content, remixes must be uploaded by March 31, 2006. Six of the best remixes will be selected by panel of Hungarian and international musicians including DJ Vadim, Szakcsi Lakatos BÃ©la, Mitsou and Dj Palotai.</p>
<p>The idea of remixing is in keeping with Nomada's tradition, as Balazs Bodo of the CC Hungary project team explained â€œNomada has its roots in the Roma music tradition where music is â€˜freeâ€™ as the common heritage of Roma people. The band has created something unique out of this, and by releasing their remix of this tradition under a CC license, they are giving it back to those to whom it belongs: a community where it is kept alive. The only difference is that we have stepped out from the analogue, manual music tradition into the realm of electronic music and digital remixes. Use it, fuse it, diffuse it!â€</p>
<p>The competition is being hosted by Creative Commons Hungary, the band Nomada and <a href="http://tilos.hu/">Tilos Radio</a>. Tilos Radio is a community, non-profit radio station in Budapest, Hungary, that was established in 1991, to draw the public's attention to the fact that there was at that time no legal framework for independent and community broadcasters. During the first years of its broadcasting, Tilos (which means "forbidden" in Hungarian) enjoyed wide public interest and played a key role in the liberalisation of the airwaves in Hungary, which happened in 1995. In 1995, Tilos Radio secured a frequency license and has since transitioned to become a key player in the cultural and lifestyle scene of Budapest.</p>
