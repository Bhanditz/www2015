<p>Today, Creative Commons wishes <a href="http://freeculture.org/blog/index.php?p=132">FreeCulture.org</a> a happy 1st birthday! We are truly grateful that there is an organized, passionate group of students advocating for free culture around the world.</p>
<p>
It is true that we indeed do have a very special present for you.  However, we need to wait for the license. Stay tuned...</p>
