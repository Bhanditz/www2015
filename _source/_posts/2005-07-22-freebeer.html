<p>Sometimes we get thirsty here at CC-HQ, and so sometimes we head up to the<br />
coffee machine and press the button for coffee.  Or sometimes we make espresso<br />
and dump the left over grounds down the drain until the drainage pipe clogs<br />
and our downstairs neighbors get a wonderful espresso-ground shower.  And then<br />
sometimes we decide to brew beer.  Good ole' CC licensed beer.  Beer that might<br />
be terrible, but that we really hope isn't.  And then sometimes we blog about<br />
it.</p>
<p>So we the interns of CC decided to take a shot at brewing the <a href="http://www.voresoel.dk/main.php?id=70">infamous CC-beer</a>.  The recipe<br />
was first published by some students in Denmark under an Attribution-ShareAlike<br />
license - perhaps as a joke in reference to the free software movement's<br />
mantra, "free as in speech, not as in beer." We think that's funny, but we also<br />
think beer tastes good.  So we took the recipe down to the local homebrew<br />
store, <a href="http://www.sfbrewcraft.com/">SF Brewcraft</a>, and consulted<br />
with the masters: <a href="http://www.sunsetbeacon.com/archives/richmondreview/2005editions/Apr05/richmondcurrentissue.html">Griz</a> and <a href="http://www.sfrichmondreview.com/archives/richmondreview/2005editions/Apr05/brewcraft.html">Rev</a>.<br />
Because we're first time brewers, they suggested we modify the recipe slightly<br />
to make it easier on our inner newbishness.  The Danes, apparently, are quite<br />
advanced in their beer-making-methodologies.  We're sad to say that we had to<br />
ditch the guarana beans, though.  It was partly because we couldn't find any,<br />
partly because we really had no idea how to work them into the modified recipe,<br />
and partly because Griz kept looking at us funny and talking about monkeys and<br />
footballs. So <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fcb/27800655/in/set-587055/">this is the<br />
recipe we ended up using</a>, CC-licensed of course.  When we manage to decipher<br />
exactly what the recipe actually says, we'll post that online as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, we bought a basic homebrew kit and enough ingredients for our<br />
first batch: grains, hops, some malt extract, a bit of yeast, and a dash of<br />
sugar, and then we began our foray into fermentation.  Altogether, the recipe<br />
should make about 5 gallons of homebrewed beer gloriousness and will take around<br />
one month start to finish.  Right now, our brew is fermenting in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#44">Free Culture Fred's</a></p>
<p>laundry room to give it that "so fresh and so clean" feel.  After another week<br />
or so it'll be ready to bottle - although sadly it will still have to sit<br />
for a few weeks more before it is ready to drink.  We're also working on some<br />
nice CC beer labels, maybe even some CC bottle caps, but we'll blog more about<br />
that later.  Until then, we thought you might find <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fcb/sets/587055/">our flickr stream</a><br />
entertaining.  Mmmm, beer.</p>
