<p>The first Creative Commons licensed PhD to be defended on 2nd October in<br />
GÃ¶teborg, Sweden.</p>
<p>The PhD thesis entitled <em><a href="http://www.ituniv.se/~klang/web/thesis/">Disruptive Technology: Effects of Technology<br />
Regulation on Democracy</a></em> deals with the negative democratic effects<br />
which often arise when attempts are made to regulate the Internet<br />
technology.</p>
<p>By studying the attempts to regulate the disruptive effects of Internet<br />
technology and the consequences of these regulatory attempts on the<br />
IT-based participatory democracy this work shows that the regulation of<br />
technology is the regulation of democracy.</p>
<p>The work has been written by Mathias Klang who is Project Lead for<br />
<a href="http://www.creativecommons.se/">Creative Commons Sweden</a>.</p>
<p>The PhD thesis is the first of its kind to be released under a Creative<br />
Commons license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/se/">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.5</a>) in Sweden.</p>
