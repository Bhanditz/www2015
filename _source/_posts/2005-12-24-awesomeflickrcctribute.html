<p>If you've spent any time surfing photo collections at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/image/flickr">Flickr</a> or elsewhere, you'll certainly appreciate <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2005/12/22/thing-a-week-14-flickr">Jonathan Coulton's music video produced with CC licensed images found on Flickr</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonâ€™t explain too much about it here, except to say that itâ€™s an example of what Creative Commons licensing makes possible. I was able to do this without calling any lawyers or receiving any cease and desist letters, because all these photos were published on Flickr with CC licenses that let me know it was OK to use them this way. No doubt youâ€™ve finished your Christmas shopping already, but if you forgot to get something for The World, maybe you should take a moment to CC license something you created and release it into the wildâ€¦
