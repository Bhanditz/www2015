<p><a href="http://openmoko.org">OpenMoko</a>, the world's first integrated open source mobile platform, <a href="http://lists.openmoko.org/pipermail/">released the artwork for their phone interface</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.  It is important to note that the software stack on the OpenMoko tries to completely run on Free Software, so that an owner has the freedom to do what they like with their OpenMoko hardware. Sean Moss-Pultz, project lead states this about the OpenMoko mobile interface:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Personally, I feel that one of the most important areas for this project<br />
is the development and  exploration of the mobile user interface. The<br />
human-machine interface is the intersection of art and technology. Great<br />
interfaces blend the visual with the technical. They balance simplicity<br />
with complexity. Often times, I feel, really great new interfaces are<br />
not immediately intuitive. They are not instantly natural. In fact, I<br />
would even argue this can be detrimental to improving interface design.<br />
If an interface is to be superior it must be different. Therefore it<br />
can't be intuitive, that is, familiar. A better metric, perhaps, is the<br />
learning time it takes until the interface feel's natural and intuitive.</p>
<p>Now that we have freed phones, everyone can contribute to an improved<br />
baseline interface. This is our collective challenge. Can we create<br />
something truly different? Can we lead this incredibly important field?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is super cool and underlines some other projects Creative Commons has been working on this summer, such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/project/liblicense">liblicense</a>, a software library for handling content licensing on various desktops (<a href="http://gnome.org">gnome</a>, <a href="http://kde.org">kde</a>, <a href="http://laptop.org">olpc's sugar</a>, etc). One of the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Desktop_Integration">considerations</a> for liblicense, in addition to adding licensing to the OLPC, is for the OpenMoko.</p>
<p>While Creative Commons is focused on providing the world with free content licenses, we also spend a good deal of time developing tools to support this endeavour. Stop for a minute and consider what a device like OpenMoko or OLPC would be if you can't get access to great content, the archives of human knowledge, free and open content? Also, what about how these devices are also content recorders now? One should also be able to put this content up on a site like <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> or <a href="http://blip.tv">blip.tv</a> simply and easily. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/project/LibLicense">LibLicense</a> helps with this goal. It is a great project that you will hear more about in the ongoing days.</p>
