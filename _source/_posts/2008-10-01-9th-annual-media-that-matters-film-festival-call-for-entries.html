<p><a href="http://www.artsengine.net/">Arts Engine</a>, a non-profit that creates social-issue documentaries, just released a <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/submit/">call for entries</a> for their <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/">9th Annual Media That Matters Film Festival</a>. The films produced for the MTMFF are short form, focus on social issues, and made mostly by young filmmakers. </p>
<p>Following a New York City Premiere, Awards Ceremony and industry networking event in June 2009, films submitted will take part in the Media That Matters international, multi-platform campaign with "DVD distribution, broadcasts, streaming and hundreds of screenings across the globe." After the festival has been completed, the films will be released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND license</a>. From <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/about/">MTMFF</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Media That Matters Film Festival is the premier showcase for short films on the most important topics of the day. Local and global, online and in communities around the world, Media That Matters engages diverse audiences and inspires them to take action.</p>
<p>From gay rights to global warming, the jury-selected collection represents the work of a diverse group of independent filmmakers, many of whom are under 21. The films are equally diverse in style and content, with documentaries, music videos, animations, experimental work and everything else in between. What all the films have in common is that they spark debate and action in 12 minutes or less.</p></blockquote>
