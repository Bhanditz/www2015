<p>Last year, Creative Commons was awarded the Golden Nica by the organizers of the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria.
<p>
Some great pictures conveying a sense of the award ceremony's atmosphere have been put online and can be found <a href="http://www.aec.at/en/archives/picture_ausgabe_02_new.asp?iAreaID=111&showAreaID=244&page=1">here</a>.
<p>
There are also some <a href="http://www.aec.at/en/festival/programm/webcasts_cc.asp">webcasts</a> of CC contributions to the Austrian launch conference (by Joi Ito, the Austrian team and myself).
<p>
Last Saturday, we had occasion to recall the event when Cornelia Sollfrank, an artist, film-maker and former Ars Electronica jury member, visited the Creative Commons office in Berlin to do an interview with Christiane for her new documentary on CC. Thanks are due to Cornelia, for all her interest and support for our cause.</p></p>
