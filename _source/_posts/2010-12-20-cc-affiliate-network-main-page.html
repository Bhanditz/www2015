<p>The CC Affiliate Network consists of 100+ affiliates working in over 70 jurisdictions to support and promote CC activities around the world.</p>
<p>The teams have a wide range of responsibilities, including public outreach, community building, translating information and tools, fielding inquiries, conducting research, communicating with the public, maintaining resources for CC users, and in general, promoting sharing and our mission. These teams have a formal relationship with Creative Commons via an agreement between organizations, universities or individuals in the jurisdiction and CC HQ.   Unaffiliated volunteers are also welcome to organize events and promote Creative Commons locally, regionally and globally.</p>
<p>If you would like learn more or contribute in one of these jurisdictions, please click on the flag below or email affiliate-program[at]creativecommons.org.  If you are looking for a flag that you do not see here, please check the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Jurisdiction_Database">Jurisdiction Database</a>.  The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Affiliates">Affiliates page</a> on the CC wiki contains more information, including regional activities and history of our work.</p>

<h3>The Licensing Suite</h3>
<p>Creative Commons offers a core suite of six copyright licenses written to conform to international treaties governing copyright. The international licenses, as well as existing ported licenses, are all intended to be effective anywhere in the world, with the same legal effect. In the past, when it was demonstrated that a ported license was needed, Creative Commons worked with legal experts to craft a localized version of its six, core international licenses. Over 50 ported license suites exist. These ported licenses are based on and compatible with the international license suite, differing only in that they have been modified to reflect local nuances in how legal terms and conditions are expressed, drafting protocols and, of course, language. They are effective worldwide, as is the international license suite. The most recent international license suite available is <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3">version 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that CCâ€™s policy is to not approve porting projects prior to the establishment of a robust, local community outreach program and demonstrated need and demand for a jurisdiction-specific license suite.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to learn about Creative Commons and the CC Affiliate Network is to watch one of our videos. <a href="/videos/cc-brasil">This ten-minute video</a> covers a significant CC event in Brazil, the impact on the country, and the people behind the project. It's a great look at how a jurisdiction can benefit from localizing CC tools.</p>
