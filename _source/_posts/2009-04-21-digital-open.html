The Digital Open, a new online community and competition for youth, is now accepting free and open technology projects from anyone 17 or younger. Free and open means openly licensed, with software licensed under a GPL license and content licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a>. (See the <a href="http://digitalopen.org/about/techoverview">Digital Openâ€“approved Licenses</a> for more details.) The competition runs until August, and they accept projects in all different languages. The competition aims to foster an online and open community of youth by encouraging them to see the benefits of open source and open licensing. Their announcement below, including a link to the Boing Boing video:</p>
<p>"What can you make with technology that will change the worldâ€”or even just make life a little easier or more fun?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iftf.org">Institute for the Future</a>, in partnership with <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> and <a href="http://boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a>, invites youth worldwide, age 17 and under, to join us as we explore the frontiers of free and open innovation. <a href="http://digitalopen.org">The Digital Open: An Innovation Expo for Global Youth</a> will celebrate projects in a variety of areas ranging from the environment, art and music to the more traditional open source domains of software and hardware.</p>
<p>From April 15 until August 15, 2009, we'll accept text, photos, and videos documenting projects from young people around the world who want to contribute to the growing free and open technology community.</p>
<p>But the Digital Open is more than an online competition. By submitting a project, youâ€™ll become a valuable member of a community of creative young innovators working in the exciting world of free and open technology.</p>
<p>Collaboration is encouraged! In addition to a variety of prizes and achievements you can earn through community participation, the top project in each category will earn a fantastic prize pack and be featured on <a href="http://boingboing.net">Boing Boing Video!</a></p>
<p>The future is yours to make! Get started at <a href="http://digitalopen.org">http://digitalopen.org</a>."</p>
