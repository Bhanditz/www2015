<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.valkaama.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-12243 aligncenter" title="valkaama_small" src="img/valkaama_small.jpg" alt="valkaama_small" width="500" height="276" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The <a href="http://www.valkaama.com/index.php?page=sources&l=en">source files</a> have been seeded for <a href="http://www.valkaama.com/">Valkaama</a>, a fresh collaborative "open source movie", filmed in Krakow, Poland.Â  Director Tim Baumann intends to <a href="http://www.valkaama.com/forum/read.php?6,109">complete the post-production</a> of the full feature movie publicly, with the help of volunteers  both amateur and professional:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here all available media sources are published in order to give you the chance to build upon them. If you want to participate in this project, by helping finishing the movie, creating remixes, making a new trailer or if you want to publish anything else here which is related to Valkaama, please get in touch with us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Valkaama (<a href="http://de.youtube.com/watch?v=ijUWGdWSzvg">trailer</a>) is a drama set  in Sweden and Finland and produced by drama school students  and amateurs in and around Krakow. It tells the story  of two disparate young men, each seeking his fortune, thrown together by fate to travel to â€œValkaamaâ€. As their paths cross, they do not realize how much  of their journey has already been determined by their pasts.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Filmmaking">Open Source and Open Content  movies</a> are still a rarity. Valkaama is one of the first  movies not only to be distributed freely, but also to guarantee free  access to all source data used and created during the production process.  The project uses CC BY-SA 3.0 licenses to guarantee very flexible use and reuse of the produced material. Almost every text,  picture and video, as well as all downloadable media, is tagged with  a respective license. In some cases the licenses are included in  the media files themselves.</p>
<p>Happy remixing!</p>
