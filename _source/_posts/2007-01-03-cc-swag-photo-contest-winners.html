After much deliberation we here at CC are excited to announce the winners for CC's 1st annual CC swag photo contest. The winners are Franz Patzig with his photo "CC" and Yamababobo with his photo "CC on Light".  We have been humbled by the number and quality of entries and thank each and every participant for their creative support. We are excited to establish the CC swag photo contest as a new CC tradition.</p>
