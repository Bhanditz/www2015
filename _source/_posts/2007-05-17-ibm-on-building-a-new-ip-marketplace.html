<blockquote>IBM assembled a worldwide community of 50 experts in the fields of law, academia, economics, government, technology and others. These experts collaborated with IBMers to discuss the issues, determine the key characteristics of a properly functioning IP marketplace, and establish a blueprint for meaningful change.</p>
<p>Throughout May and June 2006, the group collaborated in the online IP Marketplace wiki, a new media tool that enables documents to be collaboratively written and rewritten through a common Web site.</p></blockquote>
<p>So how does IBM signal good faith and get buy in from IP experts to collaborate on <em><a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/www_innovate.nsf/pages/world.gio.ip.html">Bulding a New IP Marketplace</a></em> (which almost exclusively concerns patents, as it happens)? At least in part, publish under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license.</p>
<p>To appropriate and update an old phrase: "Nobody gets fired for imitating IBM."</p>
