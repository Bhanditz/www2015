<p>My friends in the hip-hop/electronic trio Restiform Bodies recently announced a <a href="http://www.anticon.com/restiform_remix/">remix contest</a> to celebrate the release of their new album, <em>TV Loves You Back</em>, on <a href="http://www.anticon.com/">anticon</a> records. All of the acapella tracks from the album are offered under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">BY-NC</a> license, so you can sample them, remix them, and mash them up. The contest is open until January 1, 2009, and the group will choose two submissions from the contest to include on an upcoming RB vinyl remix album.</p>
