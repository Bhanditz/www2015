<p>Many who follow Creative Commons and its work already know that we have begun working on the next version of licenses, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">the 4.0 suite</a>. Even while this process has begun, we are finishing a few remaining, important 3.0 ports.</p>
<p>One of these is the Uganda 3.0 license suite, which we are pleased to announce is now open for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Uganda/Public_Discussion">public discussion</a>. This is particularly noteworthy, as the Ugandan license suite is only the second tailored suite from the Sub-Saharan Africa region to reach the public discussion stage (after South Africa). These new licenses will be useful to many Anglophone African countries that share similar copyright laws and legal histories.</p>
<p>We welcome all those who are interested to view the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Uganda/3.0/BY-NC-SA/Draft">Uganda BY-NC-SA draft</a> and contribute their comments this month. The next step for the Ugandan team will be to incorporate changes from the public discussion and to prepare the remaining five licenses for a complete Uganda 3.0 license suite.</p>
<p>A huge thank you to CCâ€™s Ugandan Affiliate, the National Book Trust of Uganda (<a href="http://www.nabotu.or.ug/">NABOTU</a>) and the Centre for Health, Human Rights and Development (<a href="http://www.cehurd.org/">CEHURD</a>), and the large CC Uganda Team led by Moses Mulumba for all their hard work!</p>
