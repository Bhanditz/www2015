<p>Every year, <a href="http://www.artsengine.net/">Arts Engine</a> produces the fantastic <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org">Media That Matters Film Festival</a>. The <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/films">festival awards and screens a dozen social justice shorts each year</a> and then releases them for sale under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives</a> <a href="http://artsengine.net/store#film_fest_dvd">license on region-free unencrypted DVDs</a>. This allows educators, fans, and audiences to arrange their own non-commercial screenings of the shorts and help promote them without having to spend time negotiating with MTM and the many different film makers participating in the festival. </p>
<p>This year's <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/">Official Ninth Annual Media That Matters Film Festival</a> is <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/news/world_premiere_of_the_ninth_annual_media_that_matters_film_festival">happening next Wednesday, June 3rd in NYC</a> but <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/news/screenings">there are hundreds of screenings organized all around the world</a>. In conjunction with the NYC festival, there will be an impACT salon featuring the festival's presenting partners that begins an hour prior to the screening at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) Visual Arts Theater.  </p>
