<p>Take an entertaining and compelling soundbite, easy to use digital audio tools, and cheap bandwidth, what do you get?  Spontaneous <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/reticulum_rex/">remix culture</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deangoesnuts.com">DeanGoesNuts.com</a> has in a few days collected dozens of remixes of Howard Dean's 2004 Iowa Caucus concession speech culminating in the infamous "yeagh!" utterance.</p>
<p>While the curator (a Dean supporter) has licensed the site using the Creative Commons Attribution license, permissions associated with the remixes themselves are uncertain.  The site's upcoming submissions policy should include a licensing requirement to clear this up.</p></p>
