<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/wiki_universal_edit_button.php">Big news recently</a> that our friends at <a href="http://www.wikihow.com">Wikihow</a> (and <a href="http://universaleditbutton.org/Universal_Edit_Button#Sites_with_Universal_Editing_Button">a growing list</a> of other wiki projects large and small) are teaming up to promote and enable <a href="http://universaleditbutton.org/Universal_Edit_Button">the Universal Edit Button (UEB)</a>, an extension for Firefox that automatically notifies users with an icon when a page is editable -- like an RSS.</p>
<p>It's a simple and great idea: at a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7700">quickly growing project</a> like Wikihow, the UEB helps old contributors to more easily discover new places for collaboration and openly invites new users to take part in editing with a wiki community. We're hoping here at CC HQ that the project takes off (and becomes standard!) to promote UEB's ambition of  "accelerati[ng] the editable web, and...society's trend towards building valued common resources."</p>
<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8387">Mike was blogging about earlier this week</a> -- we've also enabled your Creative Commons site experience with the UEB, so you'll be able to use the extension to easily find places to collaborate and contribute (including our recently launched <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8396">Case Studies wiki project to collect notable CC projects and stories</a>).</p>
<p>You can snag the <a href="https://addons.wikihow.com/univedit.xpi">extension here</a>.</p>
