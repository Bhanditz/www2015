<p>Remember back in April when I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14034">first mentioned</a> <a href="http://sj.creativecommons.org/">Student Journalism 2.0</a>, ccLearn's pilot project to bring Creative Commons and the power of new media into high school journalism classes? Well since then ccLearn and two SF Bay Area high school journalism classes have been busy getting the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <em><a href="http://voice.paly.net/">The Paly Voice</a></em>, the student-run newspaper at Palo Alto High School, <a href="http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=8908">announced</a> the integration of CC licenses, allowing its writers to choose to share their articles and op-ed pieces with the world. Already, <a href="http://voice.paly.net/view_story.php?id=8908">Sydney Rock and Rachel Harrus's article</a> announcing the collaboration has gone viral via the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC</a> license, as the CC Google Alert picked it up and placed it squarely inside my morning radar. From the article,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Starting today, readers of The Paly Voice may notice a new graphic â€” a Creative Commons licensing logo â€” tagged at the bottom of some stories.</p>
<p>The addition is due to a new collaboration with Creative Commons, a nonprofit corporation that allows published work to be available to the public for fair and legal sharing.</p>
<p>As a part of the Student Journalism 2.0 Project, <em>The Paly Voice</em>, along with the staff of <em>El Estoque</em>, the student news publication of Monta Vista High School, and the staff of <em>The Broadview</em> at Convent of the Sacred Heart High School, is the first high school in the nation to use Creative Commons licensing, which could potentially revolutionize the way creative works are available online.<br />
...<br />
<em>Campanile</em> adviser Esther Wojcicki, who is the chair of the board of directors for Creative Commons, believes that the collaboration will positively influence student journalism at Paly.</p>
<p>"It gives people the legal right to share their story," Wojcicki said. "It's like your own PR firm."</p></blockquote>
