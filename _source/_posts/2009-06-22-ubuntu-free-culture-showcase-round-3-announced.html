<p>The next release of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> is only about <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KarmicReleaseSchedule">4 months away</a>, but you have even less time to submit your best CC-licensed song, video, or photograph to be included on every Ubuntu install that goes to millions of users.  The <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuFreeCultureShowcase">Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase</a> is an open competition for anyone interested to submit their work. The deadline, however, is <strong>July 16th, 2009</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the heart of Ubuntu's ethos is a belief in showcasing free software and free culture.</p></blockquote>
