This Thursday's Frontline on PBS is covering the modern music industry in an episode titled "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/music/">The Way the Music Died</a>". It follows the industry rise after Woodstock in 1969, through music genre changes, and eventually how Napster and the Internet changed everything. It sounds interesting for musicians and music fans alike.</p>
