<p><a href="http://www.newvillagepress.net/books/building-commons-community-karl-linn.php"><em>Building Commons and Community</em></a>, a book written by the late <a href="http://www.newvillagepress.net/authors/karl-linn.php">Karl Linn</a> on his experience "creating neighborhood spaces for communities and by communities", has been released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND license</a>. From <a href="http://www.newvillagepress.net/books/building-commons-community-karl-linn.php">New Village Press</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Landscape architect and child psychologist Karl Linn (1923-2005) was a beloved, down-to-earth, visionary leader of grassroots community building, who brought life to economically disenfranchised neighborhoods in cities from Boston to Berkeley. His book documents the creativity and ingenuity of working-class citizens, students and volunteer professionals who transformed derelict vacant lots and drab institutional settings into colorful and lively community commons in Boston, New York, Newark, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Louisville KY, Pittsburgh, Columbus OH, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco and Berkeley.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems quite fitting that someone who was noted for "leadership in the field of grassroots community building" would have their final work released under terms that allow for the free redistribution of ideas and information.
