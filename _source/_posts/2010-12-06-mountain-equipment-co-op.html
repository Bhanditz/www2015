<p>One of the most exciting aspects of our fall fundraising campaign is learning about the diverse array of individuals and groups that use and see value in the work we do. Certain patterns emerge - musicians looking to freely distribute an album, learners looking for educational materials, activists supporting an open and free internet - but it is often the unexpected that spark inspiration.</p>
<p>One of those individuals is David Labistour, CEO at <a href="http://www.mec.ca/Main/home.jsp">Mountain Equipment Co-op</a>, a Canadian retailer of outdoor clothing, gear and services. We caught up with David to learn about the value a consumer business like MEC finds in our work:</p>

<p><strong>What is the link between the Mountain Equipment Co-op and CC? Do you all use our tools in your work?</strong></p>
<p>CC has, to date, gained traction in the fields of art, education and culture. The tech and bio-tech industries have embraced an open-source model but there is still a very traditional approach to intellectual property in consumer businesses and older industries.</p>
<p>We are a third party beneficiary of the <a href="http://greenxchange.force.com/">GreenXchange project</a> as we are at the consumer facing end point of our supply chain and not part of the primary industries that develop the patents. Knowing that our business is premised on cheap energy and an endless supply of raw material resources (a model that will be under stress in the not too distant future) I believe that our continuity lies in innovation and disruptive shift.</p>
<p><img src="img/mec.jpg" alt="" title="mec" width="250" height="94" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-25205" /><strong>The Mountain Equipment Co-op is a corporate sponsor of Creative  Commons - what was the motivation behind this generous giving? What is it about CC that you find important?</strong></p>
<p>My personal belief is that the current length and strength of IP protection will make us less competitive and nimble in the long run. In young societies such as the 19th Century colonies (Canada, Australia), survival depended on using ones wits - resources were plentiful and innovation thrived in spite of strong IP protection. On the contrary, some believe that it was Germany's relaxed approach to copyright that allowed it to catch up (and technically surpass) the British Empire at the same time.</p>
<p>This is purely my opinion but one needs to both encourage investment in R&D while releasing the potential of cumulative I.P. As such I felt it important to put some seed capital into a model that challenges the current limitation.</p>
