<p>I had the pleasure of speaking on two panels recently.  Last Thursday, I participated in <a href="http://sfmoma.org/calendar/calendar_event.asp?eventid=716&etype=2&func=repeat">The Open Source Paradigm</a> at the <a href="http://www.sfmoma.org">SF MOMA</a>, an event aimed to explore the history of open-source, and find new applications of its concepts in art.  A few interesting ideas came out of the panel including a <i>No Military Use</i> license, and how it benefits everyone to open-source your french fries (in this case, sharing is good because it keeps you skinny and wins favor with your friends). Attribution to <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/niemeyer/">Greg Niemeyer</a> for the fries, and a gentleman from the audience for the <i>No Military Use</i> license. The event was presented by SMAC, the San Francisco Media Arts Council.</p>

On Saturday I was at <a href="http://library.umaine.edu/coic/overview.htm">The Conference of the Intellectual Commons</a> at <a href="http://www.umaine.edu/">The University of Maine</a>.  It was amazing to hear several speakers mention Creative Commons throughout the day, including <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#1">Hal Abelson, Board member of Creative Commons</a>, who gave a great talk on <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">MIT's OpenCourseWare</a> and <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/index.jsp">DSpace</a>.  This conference was intended, at least partially, to initiate a conversation as to how the Univesity of Maine could become a leader in open-access publishing, and in a "some rights reserved" approach in general.</p>
