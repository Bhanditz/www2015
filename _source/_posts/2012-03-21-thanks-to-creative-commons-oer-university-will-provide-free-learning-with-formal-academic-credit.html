<p>Creative Commons licenses are enabling an international partnership of accredited universities, colleges and polytechnics to provide free learning opportunities for students worldwide with pathways to formal academic credit. The OER university (OERu) will create a parallel learning universe for learners who cannot afford a tertiary education by offering CC-licensed courses -- with the opportunity to acquire formal academic credit at greatly reduced cost when compared to full-tuition studies. The OERu will assemble courses from existing open educational resources (OER) under CC licenses, reducing the overall cost of development. It has adopted the <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">Free Cultural Works approved licenses</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>) as the default for OERu courses.</p>

<p>The OER Tertiary Education Network, the force behind the OERu, includes an impressive line-up of education providers, including: Athabasca University, BAOU (Gujarat's open university),  SUNY Empire State College, Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, NorthTec, Open Polytechnic, Otago Polytechnic, Southern New Hampshire University, Thompson Rivers University, University of Canterbury, University of South Africa, University of Southern Queensland, and the University of Wollongong. BCcampus and the OER Foundation are supporting the network as non-teaching partners. These <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements">founding OERu anchor partners</a> are accredited institutions in their respective national, provincial or state jurisdictions, which means that the OERu will be able to provide formal academic credit towards credible degrees in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America -- all using CC-licensed courses. Senior executives of the network have facilitated agile and rapid progress targeting the formal launch of the OERu operations in 2013. (More on that <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/CC_empowers_the_OERu_to_provide_free_learning_towards_formal_academic_credit#Visionary_and_decisive_leadership_from_OERu_anchor_partners_fuels_rapid_progress_and_innovation">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The OERu anchor partners have shortlisted eight university- and college-level courses to be developed as prototypes for refining the OERu delivery system:</p>
<ul>
<li>College Composition</li>
<li>Art Appreciation and Techniques</li>
<li>Regional relations in Asia and the Pacific</li>
<li>A Mathematical Journey</li>
<li>General and Applied Psychology</li>
<li>Critical Reasoning</li>
<li>Why Sustainable Practice</li>
<li>Introduction to Management</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively, these courses -- all first year courses except for Critical Reasoning, which is a 2nd year-level course in Philosophy -- will carry credit towards a Bachelor of General Studies, the inaugural credential selected at the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary">OERu meeting in November 2011</a>. Two of the courses will be based on existing course materials under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> from U.S. Washington Stateâ€™s <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org/">Open Course Library</a> project and the <a href="http://www.saylor.org/">Saylor Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>The OER Foundation has been trailing technologies and delivery approaches of large OER courses to help inform the design and development of these prototype courses. One such course is <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Open_content_licensing_for_educators/Home">Open Content Licensing for Educators</a>, which was designed as a free online workshop for educators and learners to learn more about OER, copyright, and CC licenses. The course materials, also under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, were developed collaboratively by volunteers from the OER Foundation, WikiEducator, the OpenCourseWare Consortium and Creative Commons, with funding support from UNESCO. In January, Open Content Licensing for Educators was conducted online with 1,067 participants from 90 different countries -- demonstrating the success of a large, collaborative, and high quality OER project. The OERu model will build on successes such as these, and demonstrate how CC licenses can maximize the return on investment in education at a massive scale. </p>
<p>Kudos to <a href="http://wikieducator.org/User:Mackiwg">Wayne Mackintosh</a> and all of his colleagues at OERu. Well done!</p>
