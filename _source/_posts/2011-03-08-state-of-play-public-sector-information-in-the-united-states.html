<p>As part of our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/tag/epsiplatform">blog series</a> for the European Public Sector Information Platform (<a href="http://www.epsiplatform.eu/guest_blogs">ePSIplatform</a>) on the role of Creative Commons in supporting the re-use of public sector information, we have researched and published the <em><a href="http://www.epsiplus.net/topic_reports/topic_report_no_25_state_of_play_public_sector_information_in_the_united_states">State of Play: Public Sector Information in the United States</a></em>.</p>
<p>Beth Noveck, former United States deputy CTO of open government and now a Professor of Law at New York Law School, provides an excellent overview of the report, <a href="http://cairns.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/us-public-sector-information-as-an-engine-of-growth.html">noting</a> that it is "an excellent report on open data in the United States" and "provides a concise and accurate primer (with footnotes) on the legal and policy framework for open government data in the US." Abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>State of Play: Public Sector Information in the United States</strong><br />
This topic report examines the background of public sector information (PSI) policy and re-use in the United States, describing the federal, state and local government PSI environments. It explores the impact of these differences against the European framework, especially in relation to economic effects of open access to particular types of PSI, such as weather data. The report also discuss recent developments in the United States relating to PSI re-use, such as Data.gov, the NIH Public Access Policy, and new open licensing requirements for government funded educational resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>The report  is <a href="http://www.epsiplus.net/topic_reports/topic_report_no_25_state_of_play_public_sector_information_in_the_united_states">published</a> on the ePSIplatform and also on our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/File:Topic_Report_no25_State_of_Play_US.pdf">wiki</a> (pdf).
