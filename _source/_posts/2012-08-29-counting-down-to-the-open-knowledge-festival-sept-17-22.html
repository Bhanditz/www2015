<p>We're psyched to be a part of <a href="http://okfestival.org/">OKFestival: Open Knowledge in Action</a>. The OKFestival takes place September 17-22, 2012 in Helsinki, Finland, and features "a series of hands-on workshops, talks, hackathons, meetings and sprints" exploring a variety of areas including open development, open cultural heritage, and gender and diversity in openness. You can buy tickets to the festival for any number of days until September 16 at <a href="http://okfestival.org/early-bird-okfest-tickets/">http://okfestival.org/early-bird-okfest-tickets/</a>. The OKFestival <a href="http://okfestival.org/">website</a> has all the details, including the preliminary <a href="http://okfestival.org/onlineschedule/">schedule</a>.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in and helped to shape the <a href="http://okfestival.org/open-research-and-education/">Open Research and Education</a> topic stream, where we are leading an "Open Peer Learning" workshop on Wednesday (Sept 19) from 11:30am to 3:30pm. For the workshop the <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a> (co-led by Creative Commons and P2PU) is combining forces with the OKFN's <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/">School of Data</a> to explore, test and develop learning challenges around open tools and practices in data, research, and education. Participation in the workshop is free (you don't even have to buy a festival ticket), but space is limited, so <strong>RSVP</strong> at: <a href="http://peerlearningworkshop.eventbrite.com/">http://peerlearningworkshop.eventbrite.com/</a></p>
<p>The workshop will be held in <a href="http://okfestival.org/venue-photos/">this</a> awesome space, reserved for four HACK workshops:</p>
