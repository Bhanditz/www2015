Today marks the launch of Creative Commonsâ€™ <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">5th Annual Fundraising Campaign</a>. This year, more than ever before, it is vital that we all support choice and sharing online. Truly, everyone benefits from a free and open internet, and we have only just begun to see how beneficial a culture of sharing can be.</p>
<p>We are reshaping history as we speak. Millions of CC supporters across the globe â€“ creators, consumers, and advocates â€“ have shown that they believe in the importance of universal access to information online. If we want future generations to enjoy the kind of rich culture that we all deserve, we must <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">invest today in the future of creativity and knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>This year we have set an ambitious goal of raising $500,000. To kick start our fundraising efforts, we are thrilled to announce a special-edition remixed Creative Commons T-shirt, designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey">Shepard Fairey</a>. Fairey is widely known for his ability to build off both his own work and the work of others to create something new and wholly unique, a quality that resonates deeply with CC's mission.</p>
<p>We are a non-profit organization, and as such we are all too familiar with the challenge of securing the resources we need to continue our work. We've been inundated with news regarding how difficult it is to raise money in todayâ€™s economic climate. However, CC doesn't see this as an obstacle; we see it as an opportunity â€“ an opportunity to call communities across the globe to action. </p>
<p>This campaign is not exclusively about fundraising; it's about supporting CC â€“ as the original architects of the licenses so many have come to rely upon, and an organization whose mission you value and uphold â€“ in whatever manner you are able. Help <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/spread">spread the word</a> about CC, start or continue <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">licensing your work</a> and <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">using licensed work</a>, and/or <b><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">give what you can</a></b>. Any amount helps and all is greatly appreciated.</p>
