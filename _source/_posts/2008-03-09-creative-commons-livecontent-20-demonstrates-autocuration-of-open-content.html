<p><strong>San Francisco, CA -- March 10, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons today announced the release of LiveContent 2.0, a LiveDVD full of Creative Commons-licensed multimedia content and free and open source software. LiveContent allows users to explore open content such as music, video, photography, books, and educational materials that can be freely used, copied, and built upon. LiveContent boots directly from the LiveDVD, making it easy for users to interact with Creative Commons-licensed content and test-drive open source software. The LiveDVD is built upon Fedora 8, a Linux-based operating system, and the disc includes a number of open source software applications like OpenOffice, The Gimp, Inkscape, and Firefox.</p>
<p>The LiveContent project draws CC-licensed multimedia content from a variety of diverse projects aiming to share creativity and culture more openly. Included are photographs from Flickr.com and Wikimedia Commons, music from Jamendo.com and Simuze.nl, videos from Make Magazine, Boing Boing TV and others, books from Manybooks.net, and open educational resources from MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative.</p>
<p>For version 2.0, LiveContent transitions from a LiveCD to a LiveDVD platform, providing more space for open content and software. Beginning with the popular photo-sharing website Flickr.com, LiveContent 2.0 demonstrates a unique content "autocuration" process. This technique manipulates web services provided by Flickr and automatically compiles photos onto the LiveDVD build. With the success of the Flickr autocuration process, Creative Commons aims to push for further standardization of CC content syndication feeds and APIs.</p>
<p>Creative Commons calls for increased community participation in curating open content and developing technologies that spread CC-licensed content. "Creative Commons doesn't maintain a centralized repository of the work published under the suite of CC licenses," said Jon Phillips, Business and Community Development Manager at Creative Commons. "But our Content Directories project has been a useful tool for organizations to list their CC-powered projects. It's important that we develop a standardized process for the community to be able to learn about and reuse open content."</p>
<p>LiveContent is a product of collaboration across a number of organizations including Red Hat (http://www.redhat.com), Worldlabel.com (http://www.worldlabel.com) and various CC content providers. LiveContent 2.0 is now available for free download at http://spins.fedoraproject.org. A pre-burned disc may be purchased at http://www.on-disk.com.</p>
