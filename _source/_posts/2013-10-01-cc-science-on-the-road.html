<p>This has been a busy Fall on the road for CC Science. The road trip started with a joint OKF/OpenUCT/IDRC workshop titled <a href="http://openscidev.com" title="Towards a Southern-led Research Agenda on Open and Collaborative Science for Development">Towards a Southern-led Research Agenda on Open and Collaborative Science for Development</a> at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. The objectives were to forge stronger community links and explore potential areas of open science for development which merit further research or action. Scientists from Latin America, Africa and Asia attended the workshop.</p>
<p>The Cape Town workshop was followed by a presentation at the <a href="http://okcon.org" title="OKCon">OKCon</a> in Geneva where we presented our plans for developing a CC Science Affiliates Network with particular focus on scientists in developing countries. The new network, which was introduced to our existing affiliates at the recently concluded CC Global Summit in Buenos Aires and whose details are under development, will augment the existing Affiliates Network with practicing scientists. These new Science Affiliates will serve as a two-way conduit between CC HQ and regional and disciplinary scientific concerns.</p>
<p>Finally, CC Science is helping organize a couple of science focused events in India. The two events will serve to bring together Indian science and technology community focused on Open Science and Data and identify potential CC Science Affiliates.</p>
<p>The first event titled <strong><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Workshop_on_Open_Science_for_Higher_Education_and_Research">Workshop on Open science for higher education and research</a></strong> is on Oct 3, 2013, at the Delhi University South Campus, led by CC community member Dr. Savithri Singh of <a href="http://andcollege.du.ac.in/" title="Acharya Narendra Dev College, Delhi University">Acharya Narendra Dev College</a>.
