<p><b>San Francisco, USA & Brussels, Belgium â€“ April 17, 2006</b></p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="http://www.crammed.be/">Crammed Discs</a> are pleased to announce the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/crammed">Crammed Discs Remix Contest</a> taking place now at ccMixter. Crammed Discs artists <a href="http://www.crammed.be/crammed/123/index.htm">Cibelle</a>, <a href="http://www.crammed.be/zir/19/index.htm">DJ Dolores</a>, and <a href="http://www.crammed.be/zir/21/index.htm">Apollo Nove</a> â€” three of Brazil's most creative musical innovators â€” are offering the audio source files from three songs online under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>, so that producers worldwide can use the sounds in remixes and new compositions. The general public is invited to download these tracks and create their own versions, appropriate elements in new compositions, and generally use the elements for any noncommercial creative expression.</p>
<p>Cibelle, DJ Dolores, and Apollo Nove will each select the three best remixes of their respective songs; these nine remixes will be included on a Crammed remix compilation, which will be sold online through digital music stores.</p>
<p>To enter, download the separated audio elements of Cibelle's â€œNoite de Carnaval,â€ DJ Dolores's â€œSanidade,â€ and Apollo Nove's â€œYage Cameras,â€ and upload a remix to ccMixter between April 26, 2006 and May 24, 2006. All entries must be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 license. Under this license, the public may legally make copies of, distribute, and create derivative works from the remixes â€“ as long as the original authors are credited and the uses are not for commercial purposes.</p>
<p><b>Quotes about the Crammed Discs Remix Contest:</b></p>
<p><b>Cibelle</b><br />
"The whole process of making music has changed. The very concept of composition now extends to the creation of sounds and textures. I'm very curious to see how other people will use and manipulate my sounds and how they will use them as tools to create new music."</p>
<p><b>Apollo Nove</b><br />
"I like the idea of giving people the opportunity to hear what I hear when I'm producing â€” a separate candomblÃ© percussion track or some painstakingly constructed soundscape. If mixing is part of the compositional process, it's only natural that I try sharing the compositional responsibilities with anyone interested in taking them on."</p>
<p><b>DJ Dolores</b><br />
"This is what every intelligent musician should do. The idea is to share and allow one's work to be cut up, reinvented and â€” who knows â€” transformed into something even better than the original. This isn't about generosity; it's about inventing new ways of creating musical products that go well beyond the world of physical carriers like vinyl and CDs."</p>
<p><b>Marc Hollander, founder of Crammed Discs</b><br />
â€œArtists should be able to decide that they want to share certain elements of their music, while keeping some control of the process. The development of broadband has opened up a whole range of great creative possibilities â€“ Â¬Â¬the most stimulating, playful, and exciting being the exchange of musical elements with people you don't know.â€</p>
