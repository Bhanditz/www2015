<p><a href="http://lulu.tv">Lulu.tv</a> is a new video site from do it yourself publisher <a href="http://lulu.com">Lulu</a> (we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/lulu">profiled Lulu</a> in May) with a twist -- creators can get paid out of a pool of people who subscribe to the site.</p>
<p>Lulu.tv was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/03/technology/03lulu.html?ex=1309579200&en=dac4bcfdb4221b83&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">written up in the New York Times</a> two days ago.  The article also mentions <a href="http://revver.com">Revver</a>, which takes a different approach to compensating creators, offering a share of advertising revenues.</p>
<p>All videos on both Lulu.tv and Revver are under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs</a> license. It will be interesting to see how these models play out as video sites look for growth and sustainability.</p>
