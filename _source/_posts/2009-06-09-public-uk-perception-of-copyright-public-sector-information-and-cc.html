<p>The UK Office of Public Sector Information has published a <a href="http://perspectives.opsi.gov.uk/2009/05/crown-copyright-user-testing.html">report on public understanding of copyright</a>, in particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Copyright#United_Kingdom">Crown Copyright</a>, the default status of UK government works ... and Creative Commons. It contains interesting findings, though I really wish it had included two additional questions.</p>
<p>Among the general (UK) public, 71% agree that government should encourage re-use of content it provides, and only 4% disagree.</p>
<p>The survey asked whether people felt encouraged or discouraged from using content when seeing "copyright" alone or alternatives on a web page:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Encouraged</th>
<th>Discouraged</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Copyright</td>
<td>15%</td>
<td>70%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Crown Copyright</td>
<td>22%</td>
<td>52%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Click-Use Licence</td>
<td>22%</td>
<td>35%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Read Terms & Conditions</td>
<td>61%</td>
<td>29%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><br clear="all" /><br />
Clearly, copyright discourages use. Of the alternative notices tested in this way, only "Read Terms & Conditions" noticeably encourages use. As the presentation notes, this option is likely to be recognized as non-transactional.</p>
<p>Adding a transaction, potentially monetary, as overhead to copy & paste discourages re-use. You'll occasionally hear us and advocates of open licensing generally talk about reducing "transaction costs" -- see, that's not just blather! One way of looking at public licenses such as CC licenses is that they make re-use non-transactional -- they pre-clear at least certain re-uses.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the survey did not evaluate a CC license notice in the same manner -- whether it encourages or discourages use. 87% of the general public did not recognize the license icon associated with the CC Attribution license. It's hard to say whether this is good or bad -- a small proportion recognizes the image -- on the other hand we're talking about the general public and one specific image.</p>
<p>Hopefully this or a similar survey will be repeated in the UK and elsewhere to see how recognition increases, or does not. Furthermore, future surveys should test not mere image recognition. Typically a license icon is paired with a statement such as "This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a>." And of course the icon and text are linked to a "human readable" deed explaining the terms, as well as a "machine readable" annotation so that seeing a license notice on a web page isn't the only vector for discovering the content as re-usable without a transaction.</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately, they survey did not evaluate whether "public domain" encourages or discourages use.</p>
<p>Overall, it is fantastic that this survey was done and published. Clearly the public wants to be encouraged to make use of its own information and a non-transactional alternative to default copyright is necessary to make that encouragement. </p>

<blockquote>It looks like much more work needs to be done to get the message out about Creative Commons and its licences.</p></blockquote>
