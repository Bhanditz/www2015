We caught a great interview with the US Government's CTO, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneesh_Chopra">Aneesh Chopra</a> <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30966_3-10358125-262.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-5">talking about his thoughts on copyright on CNET</a>. </p>
<p>When questioned about the future of copyright reform (wait for the video to load and scroll to the 7:30 mark) Chopra mentions how he "embraced the Creative Commons licensing regime" when he worked with the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/virginia">Commonwealth of Virginia to publish their Flexbook platform</a>. Chopra then states that he thinks that it was this experience that really informs his perspective on how intellectual property should be remixed, shared, and reused. </p>
<p>Needless to say, we totally agree. </p>
