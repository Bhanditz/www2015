<p>Transparency is of the utmost importance to us here at CC, especially when it comes to who is <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/supporters">funding us</a>. People ask me all the time how CC is funded, to which I answer: CC relies entirely on the community in order to stay afloat. The community being the individuals, corporations, foundations, organizations, and institutions that believe the work CC does is important and necessary.</p>
<p>Today, I'm excited to announce five new corporate supporters: <a href="http://www.nevo.com/our-home/home.htm">Nevo Technologies</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com">Ebay</a>, <a href="http://www.registry.asia/">DotAsia</a>, <a href="https://www.safecreative.org/home.shtml?cid=33934">Safe Creative</a>, and <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">wikiHow</a>. Each of these companies values the innovation that is made possible through openness and all five recognize that supporting CC is their way of helping sustain the architecture of that openness.</p>
<p>Please consider <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">joining these companies and the hundreds of other individuals who have invested in the future of CC and participatory culture</a>. If you work for a company that uses CC or supports the same ideals, please encourage them to invest in CC.</p>
<p>We have a little over a month and a half left and still have a long way to go to reach our goal of $500,000. We need your help - <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">donate today</a>!</p>
