<p>We'd like to draw your attention to <a href="http://kalite.learningequality.org/">KA Lite</a>, an offline version of the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> developed by a team of volunteers from around the world in collaboration with the <a href="http://learningequality.org/">Foundation for Learning Equality</a>. KA Lite was developed with the aim of furthering universal access to education, especially those without an Internet connection -- or those with a very slow Internet connection. This <a href="http://learningequality.org/map/">map</a> shows all registered users of KA Lite around the world. </p>
<p>KA Lite is an independent project, not associated with the Khan Academy, though as the KA Lite FAQ <a href="http://kalite.learningequality.org/faq/general/affiliation/">states</a>, Khan Academy is unofficially supportive of the project. The great thing is that the folks behind KA Lite didn't have to ask for permission because permission was already granted thanks to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a> on Khan Academy materials. This allowed KA Lite volunteers to build an open source application that would support and make available Khan Academy's 4,200+ high quality educational videos and exercises in an offline setting. </p>
<p>Dylan Barth, one of the creators behind KA Lite, says,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Through KA Lite, we distribute Khan Academy videos and exercises which are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License.<br />
<br />
The KA Lite sourcecode itself is open-source MIT licensed, and the other included software and content is licensed as described in the <a href="https://raw.github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/master/LICENSE">LICENSE file</a> (it's all open-source, it's just different licenses for different packages we use).<br />
<br />
The only potential cost to the end user would be hardware to run KA Lite on (it can run on all types of hardware bundles, from old Windows computers to the $35 Raspberry Pi) and the electricity to run the hardware."</p></blockquote>
