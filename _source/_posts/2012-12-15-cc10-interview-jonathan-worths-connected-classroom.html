<p>As a well-known British portrait photographer, Jonathan Worth has taken photographs of <a href="http://jonathanworth.com/shot-list">hundreds of famous people</a>. But don&#8217;t take his photography classes if you&#8217;re hoping to meet Jude Law. &#8220;I see that I am quite a commodity for a university: I&#8217;m one step away from someone who&#8217;s incredibly famous. And there&#8217;s a misguided assumption that because I have photographed famous people, that I am somehow connected and friends with them.&#8221; Today, Jonathan is offering his students at Coventry University a different kind of connectedness, a kind that&#8217;s less about celebrity and more about building a community of peers.</p>
<p>Along with fellow photographer Matt Johnston, Jonathan teaches a course at Coventry College called <a href="http://phonar.covmedia.co.uk/">#PHONAR</a> (photography and narrative). Although thousands of people have participated in the course over the Internet and all of the lectures and course materials are licensed CC BY-SA, <a href="http://jonathan-worth.blogspot.com/2012/11/ouch-not-mooc.html">he doesn&#8217;t consider it a MOOC</a>. But it might be a hugely important step in the development of open education.</p>
<p>When we interviewed Jonathan for <em><a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/">The Power of Open</a></em> a few years ago, he was cautiously optimistic about the possibilities for photographers in a more connected world. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have all the answers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but CC&#160;[&#8230;] helps me take advantage of the things working against me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Jonathan was approached to teach an undergraduate photography class, he was excited about it, but also leery of how to teach young photographers as they enter a world in which professional opportunities are far from a guarantee. "<em>Me as supplier</em> doesn&#8217;t work. I used to think that my product was photographs, and that was it. It doesn&#8217;t work that way. I can&#8217;t control my images on the internet. And so when I stopped trying to do that, it changed the way that I thought about myself and what I do.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;I&#8217;ll write these classes so long as they&#8217;re not the same classes that I&#8217;d done before, which were written in the 70s.&#8217; It would be morally bereft of me to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Jonathan set out to put the classes together, asking himself some tough questions about what it means to be a photographer today, and what it means to be a teacher too. &#8220;I agreed to do the classes, so long as they put front and center that my old business model and career structure were gone. No one&#8217;s written what it means to be a 21st century photographer. No one&#8217;s written that book. That also meant that I wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best teacher in the world. I had to learn my craft as a teacher, but I didn&#8217;t know all the answers. So I couldn&#8217;t sit there and spout off the answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jonathan explained to me that he saw the class as an opportunity to explore these complicated issues with his students as part of a broader community. And involving that community necessarily meant licensing the course openly, because that allowed him and his students to engage with a broader community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying not to use the word &#8216;open&#8217; now,&#8221; Jonathan told me. &#8220;I prefer the word &#8216;connected.&#8217;&#8221; And connected the classes are: Jonathan regularly collaborates with luminaries from the photography world&#160;&#8212; Steve Pyke and Chris Floyd have been recent guests&#160;&#8212; but so have people from other fields. &#8220;Cory Doctorow, he&#8217;s obviously not a photographer. But photographers don&#8217;t have all the answers. I was looking around&#160;&#8212; authors are making some ground. Musicians are lightyears ahead of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the secret sauce of of Jonathan&#8217;s connected classroom: each of those contributors brings their own communities into the fold. And Jonathan sees those connections as the real value of conducting the class openly. &#8220;That abundance of people is not a burden. I have 20 people in the room, and one person who tunes in for one of my classes, and they look at one of my students&#8217; work, and they tell one of their friends about it, they&#8217;ve amplified the classroom experience for that student. They&#8217;re bringing attention to the student. They&#8217;re bringing support. That&#8217;s what the students need, to have that network.&#8221;</p>
