<p>After many, many delays, I'm proud to announce the release of ccPublisher 1.1.  This is primarily a bug fix release that corrects the most common problems we've had reported.  This release also accounts for changes in the upload requirements at the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>You can find packages for Windows and Mac OS X <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/publisher/">here</a>.  Go on, give it a try.  And if you have suggestions or feedback, email me at nathan@creativecommons.org or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=80503&atid=559966">file a bug</a>.</p>
