<p><strong>San Francisco, CA, USA â€“ July 24, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons, a global nonprofit focused on the growth and preservation of openly shareable and reusable culture, science, and education, officially announced today that Glenn Otis Brown has rejoined the organization as a member of its board of directors. Brown was CCâ€™s executive director from 2002-2005 and is currently YouTubeâ€™s music business development manager.</p>
<p>As one of the core members of the Creative Commons team in the organizationâ€™s early days, Brown was instrumental in developing many of CCâ€™s earliest successes, including the first two versions of its machine-readable copyright licenses, its international expansion, and the remix-friendly <em>Wired</em> CD and accompanying <em>Wired</em> Magazine cover story. Brown subsequently joined Google as a products counsel, where he worked on projects including Google Image Search, Blogger, Google Talk, the Google WiFi initiative, and Google Sitemaps. As the music business development manager for YouTube, Brown works with major and independent labels, publishers, and artists to build new business opportunities around both official music videos and fan-made tributes.</p>
<p>â€œWe couldnâ€™t be more thrilled to have Glenn join the board,â€ says Creative Commons CEO Joi Ito. â€œAs Executive Director of the organization in its early days, Glenn established many of the critical ideas and relationships that CC is built upon today. That background, combined with his experience in developing creative projects and partnerships at YouTube, gives him particularly valuable insight into the opportunities for Creative Commons in the worlds of business, media, and culture at large.â€</p>
<p>"It's great to be involved with Creative Commons again,â€ Brown says. â€œIt's both humbling and exciting to see how much the organization has grown in influence and reach. Seven years ago, there was no easy way for creative people to declare 'Some Rights Reserved,' to invite open interaction with their work, while keeping their copyrights. Today, Creative Commons is the go-to solution for safe, legal sharing for folks as different as Ridley Scott, Wikipedia, MIT, or President Obama's transition team."</p>
<p>Brown joins a board of directors that includes technologist Joi Ito, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, cyberlaw and intellectual property experts Lawrence Lessig, Michael Carroll, Molly Shaffer Van Houweling, and Eric Saltzman, Flickr founder Caterina Fake, MIT computer science professor Hal Abelson, documentary filmmaker Davis Guggenheim, and Public Knowledge founder Laurie Racine.</p>
