<p>We've been working on a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/epsiplatform">series of blog posts</a> for theÂ <a href="http://www.epsiplatform.eu/">European Public Sector Information Platform</a> (ePSIplatform) on the role of Creative Commons in supporting the re-use of public sector information. In addition, we've published aÂ <a href="http://www.epsiplus.net/topic_reports/creative_commons_and_public_sector_information_flexible_tools_to_support_psi_creators_and_re_users">topic report</a>. The abstract is posted below.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Creative Commons and Public Sector Information: Flexible tools to support PSI creators and re-users</strong></p>
<p>Public sector information is meant for wide re-use, but this information will only achieve maximum possible impact if users understand how they may use it. Creative Commons tools, which signify availability for re-use to users and require attribution to the releasing authority, are ideal tools for the sharing of public sector information. There is also increasing interest in open licenses and other tools to share publicly funded information, data, and content, including various kinds of cultural resources, educational materials, and research findings; Creative Commons tools are applicable here and recommended for these purposes too.</p></blockquote>
