<p><a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is a great online photo sharing app that allows you to tag all your photos with a Creative Commons license. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4287">We've blogged about it</a> in the past and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/flickr">interviewed the founder</a> as well. Today they launched <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/">an entire area of their site</a> devoted to showing off all the photos within their system that are tagged with each license. If you jump to any of the "see all" links below, you'll find a stream of photos that are even searchable, within license type.</p>
<p>What's great about Flickr exposing this functionality is that it makes the thousands of licensed photos readily available. Say for instance I want to find photos of last week's Gilberto Gil-David Byrne concert in New York? Just drop into one of the popular licenses and <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/by-nc-sa-2.0/search/text:byrne/">search for a keyword</a>. Flickr also exposes their innovative keyword tagging system among licensed files. <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons/by-nc-sa-2.0/tags/">Here are what the most popular tags look like</a> on attribution-noncommercial-sharealike photos, allowing you to browse photos containing those keywords.</p>
