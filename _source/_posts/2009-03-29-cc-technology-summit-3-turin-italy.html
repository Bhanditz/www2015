<p>We did two Technology Summits in 2008 -- <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18">one in Mountain View, CA</a> in June and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12">one in Cambridge, MA</a> in December.  I'm pleased to announce that the third CC Technology Summit will take place June 26, 2009 in Turin, Italy at <a href="http://www.polito.it/">Politecnico di Torino</a>.  This is just prior to the <a href="http://www.communia-project.eu/conf2009">Communia Conference 2009</a> on the global science and economics of knowledge-sharing institutions. </p>
<p>We're currently looking for presentations around copyright registries, ccREL and provenance in semantic web applications for the day's program.  If you're interested, see the full <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2009-06-26">details and CFP</a> in the wiki.  Hope to see many of you there!</p>
