<p>Here's an interesting <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/july7/globejam-77.html">blurb</a> from the <a href="http://news.stanford.edu">Stanford Report</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Music Professor Chris Chafe played his celleto with Berkeley musician Roberto Morales, left, in Wallenberg Hall during an intercontinental jam session June 18 that took advantage of sophisticated teleconference technology. Projected on the screen are Hogne Moe, left, and Oyvind Berg, who "virtually" joined the concert from the Royal Academy of Technolgy in Stockholm. The quartet played three improvisational concerts as part of the "Point 25" project (the title refers to the one-quarter-second delay of the Internet broadcast) sponsored, in part, by the Wallenberg Global Learning Network. Audience members in Stanford and Stockholm also were able to watch each other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone know if the event was recorded?</p>
