<p>
Legendary musician <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jimmy/">Roger McGuinn</a> of the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jimmy/mcguinn/ByrdsFAQ.html">Byrds</a> is using the new Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/music">Music Sharing License</a> for all the songs in his <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jimmy/folkden/php/search/">Folkden</a> project.  You can see the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/music.gif">Share Music</a> tag at the bottom of each song's page, as it's displayed here for the song <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/jimmy/folkden/php/search/individ.php?mid=92">Delia's Gone</a>.  Roger builds upon a rich heritage of public domain songs even further by opening up his own sound recordings for sharing. On the site, Roger discusses how folk music lives through the process of sharing.</p>
