<p>A year and a half ago, the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/30201">released</a> the <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org/course/">first 42</a> of Washington stateâ€™s 81 high-enrollment courses under the Creative Commons Attribution license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>). Now they have released the remaining 39 under the same terms, which means that anyone, anywhere, including the state's 34 public community and technical colleges and four-year colleges and universities, can use, customize, and distribute the course materials. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org/">Open Course Library</a> project is funded by the Washington State Legislature and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It adheres to SBCTCâ€™s <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/SBCTC_Open_Policy_Open_Licensing_on_Competitive_Grants">open policy</a>, which requires that all materials created through system grants be openly licensed for the public to freely use, adapt, and distribute under CC BY. </p>
<p>For further background on the project, read our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828">2010 feature</a> about the project when it was just beginning. All 81 courses are available at the recently redesigned <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org/course/">Open Course Library website</a> where each individual course is marked with the CC BY license to enable discovery through Google and other search services on the web. </p>
