<p>Date is set for release of official Japanese licenses; Creative Commons' website now offers Japanese translation of license selection process</p>
<p><strong>Tokyo, JAPAN</strong> &mdash; The Creative Commons Japan licenses will roll out on January 15, 2004, announced GLOCOM, the Japanese research institute leading the Silicon Valley nonprofit's efforts here. Creative Commons also unveiled a Japanese translation of its licensing process, available now on its website for use with the general Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p>"Building an international commons is our most important mission," said Lawrence Lessig, Creative Commons' chairman and professor of law at Stanford University, in Tokyo this week to promote Creative Commons' various international projects. "GLOCOM has been the key to our launching the iCommons in Japan, and Japan is critical to our strategy internationally."</p>
<p>"We are very happy to be among the first iCommons participants," said Motohiro Tsuchiya, member of Creative Commons Japan and associate professor at GLOCOM, International University of Japan. "This is a collective work of many 'commoners' here in Japan, who have a unique culture of sharing creative works such as comics, animations, haikus, and more. It makes it easier for us to understand the spirit of Creative Commons."</p>
<p>The Creative Commons Japan team today made its latest drafts of the Japanese licenses available for public review from the Creative Commons website, (see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/jp/">http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/jp/</a>), and Creative Commons released its first content-negotiated translation of its licensing process.</p>
<p>Japanese-speaking visitors to the Creative Commons site now automatically view a full translation of the license choice process as the site detects the users' web browser settings. More translations will follow shortly, said Creative Commons. (For the translated text, see: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=ja">http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=ja</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>About GLOCOM</strong></p>
<p>GLOCOM was established in 1991 as a social science research institute specializing in the study of information society as well as Japanese society. From the outset it was thought that the collection and dissemination of information through the utilization of computer networks was important, and this goal was realized in 1993 when the center established an Internet connection. Ever since, by utilizing the most up-to-date information and communication technologies, GLOCOM has been able to engage in various research activities, including generation of policy proposals and involvement in education-related projects. GLOCOM has set out to be a modern information "intelprise," an institution promoting the distribution and sharing of "wisdom."</p>
