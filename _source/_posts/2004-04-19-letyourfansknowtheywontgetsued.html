<p>If you're a musician, and you want to let your fans know <a href="http://wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,62769,00.html">they won't get sued</a> if they download your songs, you should check out the Music Sharing License.  It lets your fans know they can download and share, but not sell or make any commercial use out of your music.  <a href="http://www.uptones.com/html/sounds.html">The Uptones</a>, a Bay Area based ska band, are a great example of a band who makes a few songs available under the Music Sharing License, so their fans can download, but not worry about lawsuits.</p>
