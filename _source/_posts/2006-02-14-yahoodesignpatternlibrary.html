<p>Yesterday Yahoo! <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/02/13/yahoo_patterns_released/">release of a library of design patterns</a> (think "best practices" for web interaction designers, though "design patterns" have a long history in software engineering) under the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Attribution 2.5 license</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/pattern_ratinganobject.php">Rate An Object</a> pattern for example.  The "object" used in the example is a restaurant, but could be anything, say a <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/view/media/remix">remix</a> (if you're logged into ccMixter you'll see a ratings UI very similar to the suggested Yahoo! pattern).</p>
<p>Yahoo! also released a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/">UI library</a> of code that can be used to implement such patterns under the liberal BSD software license.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://creativecommons.nl/nieuws/?p=135">Bjorn Wijers of CC Netherlands</a> for the pointer. CC software engineer Nathan Yergler has <a href="http://yergler.net/blog/2006/02/14/liberal-licensing-yahoo-gets-it-right/">more good thoughts</a> on Yahoo! getting it right.</p>
