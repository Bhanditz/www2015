<p>Many congratulations to <a href="http://blip.tv/">blip.tv</a>, which was recently <a href="http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=100934.">ranked the top video sharing site</a> by Light Reading. The free videoblogging, podcasting, and video sharing service -- which allows its users to publish their work under Creative Commons licenses -- scored an incredible 95 out of 100 points. The review cited blip's "simplicity â€¦ responsiveness, and impressive distribution options" (one of which, of course, is distribution under CC terms.) Good going, blip.tv -- keep up the great work!</p>
