<p>Yesterday evening iCommons was invited to give a lecture about CC at download-culture.org, a student-run initiative of the University of Luneburg, Germany. Chiming in with current discussion in other countries, I was subjected to an interesting exchange about the role collecting societies should play in affording authors and musicians greater individual choice with regard to the precise terms under which they license their works.</p>

The talk's webcast will be archived on <a href="http://www.download-culture.org">download-culture.org</a>. Many thanks to the enthusiastic organizers of the event.</p>
