<p>Last July we mentioned that Magnatune, a record label known for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8237">pioneering open business models</a>, had <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7590">hired a developer to work on Amarok</a>, a free software media player.</p>
<p>Today Magnatune founder John Buckman <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2008/04/giving-money-to.html">announced $11,570 in sales via Amarok</a>, of which 10% is donated to support Amarok. This number could get much bigger as Amarok goes cross-platform, <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/blog/archives/643-Amarok-recieves-first-Magnatune-sales-commision.html">notes the Amarok blog</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
With the greatly improved Magnatune integration in the upcoming Amarok 2, and the eventual release of Amarok 2 on Windows and Mac, it will be really interesting to see how far we can take this in the future. For now, I hope that the Amarok users will continue to buy music through Amarok, as it is a great way of supporting Amarok development, at the same time as supporting independent artists, who get a full 50% of the purchase price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buckman also announced that Magnatune would donate 10% of sales made through <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7389">Rythmbox</a> to support that free software media player.</p>
<p>Both media players enable a user to listen to music from Magnatune for free, and make it easy to buy -- just like the <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune web site</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Magnatune, Amarok, and Rhythmbox for making a logical collaboration (open source and open content) a practical win-win for users (ready access to DRM-free, CC-licensed music), developers, artists, and the whole movement -- it has been too long since last mentioning that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7543">it's about discovery now</a>.</p>
