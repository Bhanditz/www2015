<p>Thanks to <a href="http://onclassical.com/texts/author.htm">Alessandro</a> for alerting us to <a href="http://kunstderfuge.com/">kunstderfuge</a>, the largest resource of classical music in MIDI format online. kunstderfuge is a  subsidiary of <a href="http://onclassical.com">OnClassical</a>, the CC-friendly Italian net-label we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7866">featured earlier here</a>.</p>
<p>At kunstderfuge, there are complete piano works by <a href="http://kunstderfuge.com/beethoven.htm">Beethoven</a>, <a href="http://kunstderfuge.com/chopin.htm">Chopin</a>, <a href="http://kunstderfuge.com/haydn.htm">Haydn</a>, <a href="http://kunstderfuge.com/mozart.htm">Mozart</a>, <a href="http://kunstderfuge.com/bach.htm">Bach</a>, original piano rolls (including sacred hymns, medieval and renaissance music, and ragtimes), and much more, all available in MIDI format. The files have been produced by a variety of contributors and are ordered by composer, making them easily searchable.</p>
<p>Since 2004, many of these MIDI recordings have been released under a CC license. Just recently, kunstderfuge chose to release a plethora of new MIDI sequences under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">BY-NC-SA license</a>, meaning there are now a total of 2,192 MIDI files (13.3% of the entire collection) published under a license that allows <a href="http://www.kunstderfuge.com/notes.htm#CC">you to use the files for any purpose outside of commercial intent</a>. Very cool!</p>
