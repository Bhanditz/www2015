<p>Monday evening I had the pleasure of presenting to the <a href="http://plug.purdue.org">Purdue Linux User Group (PLUG)</a> and <a href="http://csociety.org/">Purdue Computing Society</a> in West Lafayette, Indiana.  Unlike previous talks I've done, this one wasn't about a specific development I'm working on, but rather an overview of CC and metadata.  In particular we had a good discussion about the need for relevant, accurate metadata, and the intersection points between embedded metadata and applications.  As is typical in my experience, things were the most interesting when there were questions and a dialog about what's going on, but if you're interested, my <a href="http://yergler.net/talks/purdue_plug">slides</a> are available online.  Overall it was a lot of fun, and good to see a group of students really interested in Creative Commons and the work we do.</p>
