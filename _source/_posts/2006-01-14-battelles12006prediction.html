<p>John "Searchblog" Battelle's #1 <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002149.php">prediction for 2006</a> (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Someone, and I do not know who, will make a big pile of Big Media video assets freely available on the web - and not via Google Video. <strong>This will be a major studio, or television company, which will realize that once you free content, content will come back to you in mashed up and remixed glory that has - holy smokes! - real business models like advertising and retail attached. The deal will be simple: anyone can download, rip, and mix this video, but if you plan to make money from it - even selling ads next to it - you have to cut a deal with the mother ship.</strong> The company that does this will be heralded as either visionary, lunatic, or both.</p></blockquote>

<p>Battelle posted his predictions December 21, so perhaps this observation is a bit late, but this year is less than four percent over...</p>
