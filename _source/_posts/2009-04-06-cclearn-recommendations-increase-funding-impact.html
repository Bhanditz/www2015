<p>Many foundations and other funding organizations, such as <a href="http://hewlett.org/oer">The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>, support open education by funding projects, programs, and organizations that are involved in the promotion, production, or dissemination of open educational resources (OER). Because of these funders, the ability to freely adapt, reuse, repurpose, and redistribute educational resources has become a reality, since many grantees now openly license their educational resources. </p>
<p>However, there are still a great deal of projects and organizations that disseminate resources under default copyright laws, even under the auspices of open education. These resources, though accessible, are not really open in the sense that they can be adapted, translated, and repurposed to reach their full effectiveness. For those involved in open education this proves problematic, as the entire purpose of funding such projects is to increase openness in a space where it can really change lives, and where the proper use of funds goes a long way in terms of impact.</p>
<p>How do we help open education projects and organizations achieve their maximum possible impact? ccLearn has taken a stab at answering this question as part of its new <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/productions/#Recommendations">ccLearn Recommendations</a> series. The ccLearn Recommendations series provides best practices, advice, recommendations, and guiding principles for OER, CC, and related issues.  The new document entitled, <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cclearn-recommendations-increase-funding-impact-05-apr-09.pdf">ccLearn Recommendations: Increase Funding Impact</a>, are recommendations for organizations that fund the production of open educational resources (OER). The overarching recommendation is that such organizations "should adopt a policy that strong encourages or requires their grantees to disseminate OER under Creative Commons licenses in order to maximize their reach and impact." The reasons for this are several, all of which are elaborated in compelling and concise terms in the document. </p>
<p>The document, like all <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/productions/">ccLearn Productions</a>, is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, free for anyone, especially organizations, to appropriate as they see fit---for the document itself to achieve its maximum impact. No one document is final and summative, just like no one educational resource should be mistaken as such under closed copyright law. We encourage you to take these recommendations as open to improvement and flexible in its implementation. Derivatives are always encouraged.</p>
