<p><a href="http://lulan.com/">Lulan Artisans</a>, a for-profit social venture that designs and produces high-quality, hand-woven textiles, recently launched a competition - <a href="http://11-17.lulan.com/">11Ëš/17Ëš</a> - to solicit community designs for Lulan's 2010 collection.</p>
<p>Lulan will accept submissions until October 15th and are encouraging participants to publish their work under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC license</a> and additionally make them available to independent artisans for commercial purposes and for use without attribution. The goal behind this is that the <a href="http://11-17.lulan.com/about/official_rules">designs submitted</a> will "populate a database of Creative Commons designs that weaving cooperatives around the world can use to increase their ability to make a sustainable living and be less at risk of poverty."</p>
<p>You can learn more about the competition's guidelines at the <a href="http://11-17.lulan.com/about/design_brief">11Ëš/17Ëš</a> website.</p>
