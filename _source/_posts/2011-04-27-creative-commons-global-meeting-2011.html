<p>Since the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCi_Legal_Day_2008">last global meeting</a> of the Creative Commons community in Sapporo, we've seen the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13304">launch of CC0</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23830">Public Domain Mark</a>, and a half-dozen more <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">CC affiliate jurisdictions</a> with many more in the works. To celebrate this and many other <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/milestone">CC milestones</a>, we are announcing our next global meeting, to be held the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Meeting_2011">16th-18th of September this year in Warsaw, Poland</a>, co-hosted by our CC Poland team led by Alek Tarkowski.</p>
<p>The event will bring together <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Jurisdiction_Database">affiliates</a> from more than 70 jurisdictions, CC staff, as well as a number of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board">CC Board members</a>.  The meeting will mark the beginning of requirements gathering for version 4.0 of the CC license suite, and promises workshops and forums on CC community building and adoption efforts in key sectors such as education, public sector information, and data.  Planning is already underway to maximize opportunities for affiliates to meet with the Board and other key stakeholders over the course of the event. As September draws nearer, more information, such as scholarships and funding for affiliates as well as ways the community can contribute ideas for events and sessions, will be announced here on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog">blog</a>. </p>
<p>We look forward to contributions from our community over the next several months to make this event as successful and productive as possible.  A sincere thanks to both the CC Australia and CC Poland teams for submitting compelling proposals for co-hosting the event in response to our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/25360">solicitation!</a></p>
