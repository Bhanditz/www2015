<p>Over on the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/">Science Commons blog</a>, <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2009/03/17/nih-mandate-made-permanent/">Thinh writes</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The NIH Public Access Policy, which was due to expire this year, has now been made permanent by the <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/media/Release09-0312.html">2009 Consolidated Appropriations Act</a>, signed into law last week.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Last year, Science Commons, SPARC, and ARL jointly released a <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/nih_copyright_v1.pdf">White Paper</a> authored by our board member Mike Carroll called <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/nih_copyright_v1.pdf">"Complying With the National Institutes of Health Public Access Policy,"</a> explaining the new NIH-mandated PubMed deposit requirement and questions that grant recipients should consider in designing a program to comply with it. At that time, the new mandatory policy had just taken effect, and many recipients were still learning how to comply. Nevertheless, the results were dramatic. Prior to NIH's mandatory deposit requirement, under a voluntary policy NIH began in 2005, the compliance rate in terms of deposits in PubMed had been very low (4%, as published in an NIH report to Congress in 2006). Shortly after the adoption of the new mandatory policy, submissions spiked to an <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/info/CA6581624.html#news1">all time high</a>, prompting an NIH official to project compliance rates of 55-60%. Just take a look at <a href="http://www.nihms.nih.gov/stats/index.shtml">this NIH chart</a>, and note the sharp rise after the policy took effect in early 2008.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In a subsequent <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/opendoors_v1.pdf">White Paper</a> that Science Commons and SPARC jointly issued, our <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/opendoors_v1.pdf">recommendations</a> included looking beyond compliance with the new policy and taking this opportunity to develop comprehensive institutional deposit and public access policies, such as <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~secfas/February_2008_Agenda.pdf">Harvard's open access policy</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Making the NIH Public Access Policy permanent will provide scholars and institutions with much needed certainty and impetus to focus on implementing these requirements within their institutions. It also creates a opportunity for scholars, universities, and the research community to take a broader look at their institution's scholarly publishing and open access policies, not only as it applies to deposit in PubMed, but also as it applies to their own institutional repositories and scholarly communities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will work with our collaborators to develop further policy and legal briefings for university and public research institutions who are studying these issues. Look for that this summer.</p>
