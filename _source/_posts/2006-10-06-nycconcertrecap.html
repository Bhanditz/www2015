<p>Last Friday night, <a href="http://www.wired.com/"><i>Wired</i></a> and <a href="http://flavorpill.net/">Flavorpill</a> hosted a concert in New York to help raise money for Creative Commons. The show featured amazing performances by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.myspace.com/peepingtomispatton">Peeping Tom</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/diplo">Diplo</a>, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/girltalkmusic">Girl Talk</a>, as well as short introductions by Wired's <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">Chris Anderson</a> and CC's <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a>.</p>
<p>We're happy to report that the show was a smashing success. It was a sold out event, with people lined up outside offering to buy tickets for $100 a pop. The show itself was incredibly fun, creative, and invigorating -- Girl Talk rocked out behind his laptop, mashing together what seemed like thousands of sounds. Diplo played rapid-fire mixes of Brazilian hip-hop and American dance music while a VJ executed a live video set. Peeping Tom capped off the night with a blend of funk, metal, hip-hop, and pop. Great stuff all around. It was amazing to see so many people come out to support CC -- and to see them dance and celebrate to the sounds of remix.</p>
<p><p>Thanks very, very much to Melanie Cornwell of <i>Wired</i> for making the concert possible. Also thanks to Sascha Lewis and Lynnel Herrera of Flavorpill, the helpful staff at <a href="http://www.irvingplaza.com/">Irving Plaza</a>, the artists, and our friends at <a href="http://www.freeculturenyu.org/">Free Culture</a> for helping to make this a wonderful night.</p>
