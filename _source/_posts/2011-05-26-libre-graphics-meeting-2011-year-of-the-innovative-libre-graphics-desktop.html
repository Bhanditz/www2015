<p>In 2007, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7450">Jon Phillips wrote this about Libre Graphics Meeting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wanted to underline how key it is for all those in Open ____ (Open Content, Open Source, Open etc) get together at some point to see each other physically, as often it's only virtually.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2011/">It's now 2011</a> and Jon Phillips is a CC alumnus but still active in <a href="http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/">Libre Graphics Meeting</a> every year.  This year Jon Phillips invited me to attend and speak as CC representative and community member about <a href="http://blender.org">Blender</a> and about <a href="http://autonomo.us/2008/07/franklin-street-statement/">free network services</a>.  I spoke three times:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the <a href="http://montrealpython.org/">Montreal Python</a> usergroup giving a talk on Blender and Python very similar to <a href="http://pycon.blip.tv/file/4880934/">the talk I gave at PyCon this year</a> and similarly well received (<a href="http://dustycloud.org/misc/pycon_2011_blender_talk.pdf">slides here</a>).  I also gave a lightning talk on my new project, <a href="http://mediagoblin.org/">GNU MediaGoblin</a>.</li>
<li>Another talk on Blender, this one focused more on artists and advocacy animations.</li>
<li>An <a href="http://autonomo.us">autonomo.us</a> panel on free network services.  I strongly believe that licensing that permits copying and modification is essential to the success of free network services and we addressed this a bit but not as strongly as I'd hoped.  Aside from this, the conversation was very good, especially in the second half of the talk which was mostly driven by audience participation.  It seems clear to me that the Libre Graphics Meeting community understands why distributed free software network services matter, even to artists.  GNU MediaGoblin was introduced formally to Libre Graphics Meeting during this talk also.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were to describe Libre Graphics Meeting 2011 in one phrase it might be "2011 is the year of the innovative libre graphics desktop."  Of course, in saying this I am <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Year_of_the_Linux_Desktop">making a joke</a>, but there is some truth to it.  It's unfortunately true that libre graphics are unlikely to become the dominant software tools for graphics authoring in the near future, but even still, Libre Graphics Meeting demonstrates that <a href="http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/446275:mad-science-headed-from-the-libre-graphics-meeting-to-your-linux-desktop">people are clearly doing great and innovative things</a> in the libre graphics world.</p>
<p>And just as <a href="http://mako.cc/writing/hill-free_tools.html">Free Software Needs Free Tools</a>, <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">free culture</a> also needs free tools.  If culture is going to be reworked, remixed, and even simply survive the dangers of obsolescence, we need unencumbered formats and tools to empower current and future authors and artists. And so the libre graphics community plays a critical role here.</p>
<p>Free culture and free software don't mix often enough, but when they do the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24149">result is powerful</a>.  In few places does this mixing happen as clearly as it does in the libre graphics community, and so it's good that we have Libre Graphics Meeting as a gathering point for powerful intersections such as these.</p>
