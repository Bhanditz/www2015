<p>You'll <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10637">recall that we did a survey in collaboration with </a><a href="http://museumpods.com">MuseumPods</a> back in November asking basic questions about podcasting, MuseumPods, and Creative Commons. </p>
<p>We've decided to release a summary of the results from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/podcastresults.png">survey as one big PNG file</a> (785px Ã— 5080px, 170kb). This file was created using the Summary function of Google Doc's Form/Spreadsheet and contains a sampling of some of the long form data entered into the spread sheet, as well as plenty of pretty graphs and charts detailing the breakdown in responses that we received. Though by no means scientific, the data is still worth a look if you're interested in talking about CC with your community.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, is that MuseumPods has incorporated CC licenses into <a href="http://www.museumpods.com/podcast_software.html">their FeedMe product</a>. FeedMe allows anyone to create a podcast feed for free, and now creators can choose what CC license they want to apply to their podcast. <a href="http://texas.museumpods.com/">Sign up for FeedMe here</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Podcasting_Legal_Guide">read our podcasting guide</a>, and start podcasting with CC today!</p>
