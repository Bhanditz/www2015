<p><a href="http://www.bvisio.com/">Barcelona VisiÃ³</a> is a new video sharing site sponsored by Barcelona's Town Hall, where anyone can upload their footage of Catalonia's lovely capital city. The site currently hosts many short videos that capture Barcelona's beauty, as well as a few longer clips that cover current issues and events. Most of the material is available for download under CC licenses; check out all that this great new resource has to offer.</p>
