<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> and <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/snowflake/profile">Snowflake</a> are proud to announce a <a href="http://ccmixter.org/earth-day-2009-with-snowflake">call for remixes</a> in honor of Earth Day 2009. Singer, musician and poet Snowflake has put all the stems, including the a cappella for her song <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/snowflake/20237">Apologize</a> into the Commons under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0">Attribution NonCommercial</a> license, hosted on <a href="http://ccmixter.org/files/snowflake/20237">ccMixter</a>,  and is looking for remixes to be featured on her site on April 20th.</p>
<p>After all the remixes are posted, Snowflake will pick her favorite remix and include it as a surprise 11th track on her FanClub release "One or Ten" on April 20th. She tells us the remixer will be awarded producer royalties for the track as well.</p>
<p>In addition, Snowflake has generously offered to donate $200 to a green non-profit, to be chosen by the producer of her favorite remix of Apologize. </p>
<p>Snowflake is a long time and popular contributor to ccMixter and thinks "ccMixter embodies a significant evolution in synergistic sound. With creativity expanding from its source, our musical compositions gain color, speed and strength as we share, mix, and mash."</p>
<p>Make sure to check out Snowflake at her <a href="http://www.tunetrack.net/snowflake">new website</a> that features both her ccMixter source tracks and five favorite remixes. </p>
<p>There's not a lot time left to crank out the tunes so read more and download the sources  at  <a href="http://ccmixter.org/earth-day-2009-with-snowflake">Snowflake's Earth Day Call for Remixes</a>.</p>
