<p>by the UNESCO Open Educational Resources Community today. For those of you who don't know, the <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">UNESCO OER Community</a> is an international online community "[connecting] over 700 individuals in 105 countries to share information and discuss issues surrounding the production and use of Open Educational Resources â€“ web-based materials offered freely and openly for use and reuse in teaching, learning and research." (We blogged about them last <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9818">October</a>.) The new discussion will run for three weeks and is <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=Access2OER">open to all</a>. From their community's wiki:</p>
<p>"<em>OER is seen as having the potential to extend access to knowledge worldwide, but there exist certain barriers to its achieving this objective. Access is one potential barrier â€“ and a crucial challenge.</p>
<p>Although our initial interaction on the issue started with the consideration of limited or no connectivity, lack of electricity was identified as an even more basic barrier to access to OER. However, there are many other potential barriers or constraints and it will be useful to identify the range of them, for there are emerging solutions or approaches that would mitigate the problems. Developers of OER will benefit from having these in mind â€“ donors and other agencies may be able to contribute to addressing them.</em>"</p>
<p>This week the discussion will focus on "Identification and description of the main problems associated with access, and an initial development of a classification scheme." The discussion is already underway, moderated by Bjoern Hassler, a senior research associate at the University of Cambridge, so if you have something to say, go <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=Access2OER/Invitation">join</a> it now!</p>
