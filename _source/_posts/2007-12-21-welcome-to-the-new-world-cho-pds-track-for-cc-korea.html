<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_PD">Cho PD</a>, one of the most successful professional hip-hop artists in Korea, has just released a track in collaboration with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/kr/">CC Korea</a>. The song made its debut last week at <a href="http://www.creativecommons.or.kr/blog/article/35">CC Hope Day</a> in Seoul. Jongeun Lee, a volunteer from CC Korea, took up Cho PD's  offer to "Remix this, go ahead," and produced a music video to accompany the track.</p>
<p>You can watch this incredible video on <a href="http://blip.tv/file/552623/">blip.tv</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=_9IInYcUS20">youtube</a>. It highlights 76 CC-licensed images from <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a>, and the video itself is under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/kr/">BY-NC-SA</a>.</p>
<p>This project is a great example of the "new world" that Cho PD sings about: a professional musician writes and performs a song in support of Creative Commons and licenses it so that others can remix it. Then an amateur video producer is inspired by the musician to make a video for his track. And on top of that, the video itself is a collaboration with many photographers, all of whom have used Creative Commons licenses to clearly and legally state, just as Cho PD's did, "Remix this, go ahead."</p>
