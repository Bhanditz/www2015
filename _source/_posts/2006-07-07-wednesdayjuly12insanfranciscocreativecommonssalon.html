<p>Yes! The monthly <a href="http://creativecommons.org/salon">CC Salon</a> is next Wednesday, July 12, from 6-9pm at <a href="http://shinesf.com/">Shine</a>, (1337 Mission Street between 9th and 10th Streets). Come out and discuss your interests around CC, copyright, creation and licensing (among other topics). Note: Shine is a bar, and thus, only people 21 and older may attend.</p>
<p>CC Salon is a casual monthly event focused on conversation, networking, and presentations from people or groups who are developing projects that relate to Creative Commons licensing, content, and tools. Please invite your friends, colleagues, and anyone you know who might be interested in drinks and discussion.</p>
<p>This dynamic salon features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chris Hughes and Jeff Hammerbacher from <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, the largest social networking site on college campuses, are presenting an overview of the project and how it ties in with CC.</li>
<li>Derek Slater and Jason Schultz from the <a href="http://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) are presenting the "<a href="http://www.eff.org/corrupt/">Corruptibles</a>" animation and discussing currently what is happening with copyright in Congress.</li>
<li>We are screening the Creative Commons licensed (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">CC BY 2.5</a>) Open Source Movie, <a href="http://www.elephantsdream.org">Elephants Dream</a>.</li>
<li>And finally, we are having "OpenSalon" time for 4-5 quick 5 minute presentations in rapid fire. Please <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/85776">RSVP</a> if you are interested in this chance to demo your new project, play your new remix, get feedback from the community, or shamelessly plug your upcoming event (that relates to CC of course!).</li>
</ul>
<p>As with previous CC Salons in SF, this event is <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/85776">posted at Upcoming.org</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/salon">CC Salon</a>!</p>
