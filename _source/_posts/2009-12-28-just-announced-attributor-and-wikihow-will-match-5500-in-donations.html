<p>We're absolutely thrilled to announce that our longtime friends <a href="http://www.attributor.com/">Attributor</a> and <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/">wikiHow</a> have come together in the final days of our annual campaign to generously match the next $5,500 in donations! wikiHow has committed to giving $3000 and Attributor $2500, so please join them and show you care about the future of Creative Commons and building a culture of sharing. Even if you've already donated, please consider <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">giving whatever you can today</a></strong> - it will automatically be doubled!</p>
<p>We're proud to have the continued support of both wikiHow and Attributor, who, since each company's founding, have been dedicated advocates of the commons and have demonstrated how we can use the Internet as a powerful digital tool to promote collaboration, innovation, and the sharing of information.</p>
<p>wikiHow is "a collaboration to build and share the world's largest, highest quality how-to manual." Every month, millions of people turn to the multilingual site to learn how to do something new, and it relies on the knowledge, creativity, and contributions of people around the globe to make it a unique and useful tool. wikiHow supports Creative Commons because, in the words of its founder, Jack Herrick, "I'd like to live in a world where knowledge can grow and be built upon by many. Creative Commons creates the infrastructure to make this information sharing possible." Check out wikiHow's <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/">redesigned Web site</a>.</p>
<p>Attributor provides the free service <a href="https://fairshare.attributor.com/fairshare/homepage?company=cc">FairShare</a>, first previewed at the CC tech summit in 2008. FairShare lets you assign a CC license to your work and receive information on how and where it is shared with others. Results come back as an RSS feed and include information about the percentage of your work re-used, whether youâ€™ve received attribution and if ads are present. According to Attributor VP, Rich Pearson, "We're a proud supporter of Creative Commons and do everything we can to spread their vision of saving the world from failed sharing."</p>
<p>Please join Rich, Jack, and the rest of the folks at Attributor and wikiHow in investing in Creative Commons and a bright future for the world of online sharing. Your support helps, and every contribution counts, so please give what you can and <strong><a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donate today</a></strong>!</p>
