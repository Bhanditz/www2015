<p>Looking for another way to support CC? Be our friend! By connecting with Creative Commons on sites like <a href="http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=18870062776">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/creativecommons">MySpace</a>, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/creativecommons/">Flickr</a>, you can help us broaden our reach and educate the masses about the Creative Commons mission.</p>
<p>So, starting today, we're issuing a 50,000 friend challenge to our community. We're asking you to help us expand CC's overall friend network to 50,000 people across the Web's various social networking and content sharing sites by December 15 â€“ the date of our fifth birthday party.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/spread">ways you can help</a> our friend network grow. If you aren't a member of any of these sites, please help us by starting (or expanding) a CC group on any site you do use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Join our <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/view_cause/151">Facebook Cause</a>, become a top recruiter, or become a <a href="http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=18870062776"> CC Fan</a></li>
<li>Participate in the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/contest">2007 CC Swag photo contest</a> on Flickr</li>
<li>Become a Creative Commons friend on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/creativecommons">MySpace</a> or <a href="http://www.friendster.com/creativecommons">Friendster</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you can also help Creative Commons by <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">contributing to our annual fundraising campaign</a>. As always, we thank you sincerely for your support!</p>
