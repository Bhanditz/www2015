<p>At Creative Commons, we are always looking for new and interesting ways to find out just how much CC licensed content is out there on the web. Our latest project, the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/ODEPO">Open Database of Educational Projects and Organizations</a> (or <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/ODEPO">ODEPO</a>), <strong>needs your help</strong>!</p>
<p>In 2008, ccLearn (now <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20292">fully integrated</a> into Creative Commons core) conducted a survey of educational projects online for its report to <a href="http://hewlett.org/">The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> entitled "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11700">What Status for Open? An Examination of the Licensing Policies of Open Educational Organizations and Projects</a>" (<a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/license-mapping-report-15_dec_-2008-color-v2.pdf">pdf</a>). Several months later it was followed up with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/16221">data supplement</a> (<a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/What-status-for-open-Data-Supplement-v1.pdf">pdf</a>) that visualized some of the findings.</p>
<p>The report was developed in conjunction with <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/ODEPO">ODEPO</a>, which is a Semantic MediaWiki-based database of organizations involved in providing educational content online. Currently, ODEPO includes <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:BrowseData/Organization?_single">1147</a> sites affiliated with various organizations, the majority of which were provided to us back in 2008 by educational repositories involved in the creation and expansion of Open Educational Resources (OER). </p>
<p>We'd like to continue supporting this database to help researchers, advocates, and learners find educational projects, analyze trends in online education, and become more effective advocates for open education. We hope that increased awareness of the digital education landscape will increase communication between consumers, producers, and curators of educational content which can lead to more open practices.</p>
<p><strong>How to help:</strong> <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:BrowseData/Organization?_single">Browse ODEPO</a>. If your favorite educational project or organization is missing, incomplete, or incorrect, please <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:UserLogin">log in to</a> or <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&type=signup&returnto=ODEPO">create</a> a CC wiki account and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/ODEPO_FAQ#How_do_I_contribute.3F">follow these instructions</a>. Alternatively, you can simply <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:BrowseData/Organization?_single">browse</a> to your educational project and click the "Edit this data" button on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> There is now an <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/ODEPO_Open_Tasks">Open Tasks tracker</a> for ODEPO where you can find lists of pages that need more data.</p>
