<p><a href="http://nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> continues <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5164">to write about mash-ups as if they just discovered them</a>. Today <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/arts/music/09leed.html">a sidebar</a> outlining the history of sampling and mash-ups appears in the Week in Review. Conspicuously missing: The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">WIRED CD</a> and the current "<a href="http://ccmixter.org">Fine Art of Sampling</a>" contest. (Negativland gets a mention, though.)</p>
