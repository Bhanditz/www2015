<p>The <a href="http://w.cali.org/lec">Legal Education Commons</a> launched yesterday with open access to over 700,000 federal court decisions. The LEC is an "open, searchable collection of resources designed specifically for use in legal education." It is made possible by a collaboration between the Center for Computer-Assisted Legal Instruction (<a href="http://w.cali.org/">CALI</a>) and Harvard's <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center for Internet and Society</a>. From the <a href="http://www2.cali.org/index.php?fuseaction=pages.news#212">press release</a>:</p>
<p><em>â€œAll teachers of law have materials and notes they use in teaching,â€ says John Mayer, CALI Executive Director. â€œMany freely share their materials with colleagues, but there has never been a singular searchable, taggable space to serve that function for the entire legal academy,â€ he explains, â€œuntil now.â€<br />
...</p>
<p>While the LEC opens with an extensive collection of court cases and images, it can expand its collection of resources only through contributions and donations from the legal education community.</p>
<p>CALI implores faculty and staff at CALI member schools to share any files from personal collections that may facilitate learning amongst the legal education community. â€œEspecially as we increasingly garner more participation and sharing from legal educators,â€ says Mr. Mayer, â€œthe Legal Education Commons will be a great, non-commercial tool for those who are both teaching and learning the law.â€ </em></p>
