<p>On Saturday, April 27, the Creative Commons Board of Directors met at the Safra Center at Harvard. We discussed the accomplishments of the past 12 months, both in the organization and in the broader open movement, and the new opportunities on the horizon, including creating an Advisory Council to complement the Board itself.</p>
<h2>The State of CC: 2012-13 in review</h2>
<p>CC CEO Cathy Casserly gave an upbeat review of CC's past 12 months. Some key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CC's international network of affiliates and champions continues to grow and strengthen</strong>. Affiliates and other volunteers organized over 30 celebrations around the world for <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons' tenth anniversary</a> as well as events, salons, and conferences year-round. Regional CC networks are becoming more energized, with regional gatherings taking place around the globe.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Commons continues to serve as a voice for open.</strong> Through new initiatives like the <a href="/weblog/entry/37179">School of Open</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Open_Policy_Network">Open Policy Network</a>, CC is helping to teach everyone from world governments to individuals about the value of open licensing.</li>
<li><strong>The open education movement is stronger than it's ever been.</strong> In the past year, the governments of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34566">British Columbia</a>, <a href="http://projects.siyavula.com/blog/2013/01/16/the-year-in-review-highlights-for-siyavula-in-2012/">South Africa</a>, the <a href="/weblog/entry/34328">United States</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34288">California</a> have made major investments in OER (open educational resources). UNESCO member states <a href="/weblog/entry/33089">unanimously approved a resolution</a> calling for the development of quality OER.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Opportunities and Challenges Ahead: The next 12 months</h2>
<p>The discussion then turned to the next 12 months at Creative Commons.</p>
<p>CC's expanded global team will create new opportunities for collaboration and development in the CC Affiliate Network. Cathy outlined a plan to engage with the CC Affiliate Network in developing instructional resources for license users, and announced a new grant that will provide critical support for affiliate collaborations.</p>
<p>CC General Counsel <a href="/staff#dianepeters">Diane Peters</a> led a discussion about the forthcoming <a href="/weblog/entry/36713">version 4.0 of the license suite</a>, explaining how the new licenses will address several important issues in interoperability and internationalization.</p>
<p>CC Director of Product Strategy <a href="/staff#danmills">Dan Mills</a> laid out his plan to develop a new set of products that will make it easier for users to mark and attribute CC-licensed content, while letting licensors interact with people who reuse their works. <a href="/board#glenn">Glenn Brown</a> and <a href="/board#lawrencelessig">Lawrence Lessig</a> agreed to serve as advisors to the project development pipeline.</p>
<h2>New Directions for CC's Board</h2>
<p>Finally, we discussed the future of CC's Board of Directors. As the program areas in which CC works have grown and shifted, the demands on the Board have changed too. We agreed on a plan to establish an Advisory Council that would advise and critique the overall CC strategy, complementing and expanding the Board. We will conduct a search for new Board and Advisory Council nominees with key expertise and skill sets. Part of the search process will include an upcoming open call for nominations for our Board of Directors and for our new-to-be-formed, Advisory Council. We hope you'll actively put forward candidates.</p>
<p>This was my second in-person Creative Commons Board meeting, and it reaffirmed my pride in being chair for an organization that is shaping the future. I speak for everyone on the Board when I see we're excited about the changes and challenges to come in the next few years.</p>
