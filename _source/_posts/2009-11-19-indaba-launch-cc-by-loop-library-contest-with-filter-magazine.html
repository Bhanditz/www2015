Already one of the premier destination for musicians to collaborate online, their new clip library adds to Indaba's appeal by offering an easy and legal way for musicians to add sounds and loops to their work.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Indaba has teamed up with <a href="http://www.filter-mag.com/">Filter Magazine</a> on <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/featured_programs/show/filtermagcontest"><strong>a remix contest</strong></a>, challenging Indaba's community of over 300,000 (!) musicians to create an original track that includes a minimum of two clips. The contest winner, determined by Filter Magazine, will be profiled in an upcoming issue as well as have their winning track featured in the issueâ€™s monthly digital sampler. The due date for entries is December 8th at 5PM EST.</p>
