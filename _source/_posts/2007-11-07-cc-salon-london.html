<p align="left"><a href="http://ccsalon-london.org.uk">CC Salon London</a> is back and hosting its final event of 2007, dedicated to more discussion and debate on the subjects of art, technology, copyright and free culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This time round weâ€™ll be joined by Jordan Hatcher (<a href="http://www.opencontentlawyer.com/">blog</a>), a lawyer and legal consultant specializing in intellectual property and technology law, who will present and discuss his work on a new report entitled <a href="http://www.eduserv.org.uk/foundation/studies/cc2007">'Snapshot study on the use of open content licenses in the UK cultural heritage sector'</a>. This study primarily examines the use of the Creative Archive (CA) and Creative Commons (CC) licenses among UK museums, libraries, galleries, and archives. The key objective has been to get a snapshot of current licensing practices in this area in 2007, and Jordan will report on his findings."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Salon will be held from 7PM - 11PM at: The Crown and Anchor, 22, Neal St, Covert Garden London WC2H 9PS, on the 20th of November 2007.</p>
