<p><a href="http://irate.sourceforge.net/">iRATE Radio</a>, an open-source application that sends users free-legal MP3s through its radio client, is now able to read the ID3 tags of MP3 files to identify Creative Commons license information.  Enabling this kind of feature is exactly why Creative Commons put forth its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/embedding#1">MP3 embedding strategy</a> many months ago, which defines a standard way to embed Creative Commons metadata in the ID3 tag of an MP3.  Our hope was that file-sharing networks, and applications like iRATE, would read the ID3 tags, and tell users if there was a Creative Commons license attached.  This way, users could feel assured to trade these MP3s online, or even make remixes of them. Check out <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/cccr/irate-cc-small.png">some</a> <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/cccr/irate.png">screenshots</a> of the CC enabled iRATE Radio application.</p>
<p>iRATE has yet to enable the second part of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/embedding#2">MP3 strategy</a>, where MP3s are validated through an automatic web page verification process. (Validation can be done manually, though).  This step is important because it prevents people from making fraudulent license claims about the MP3s.  </p>
<p>Beyond being able to read ID3 tags, iRATE Radio has a catalogue of over 46,000 MP3s it can send you.  It's also really smart in that it enables users to rate songs and then sends you more songs based on your ratings and preferences.  We hope that more applications follow the lead of iRATE! </p>
