<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aclu">ACLU</a> has begun its first foray into CC licensing, releasing all the content from their new website, <a href="http://www.marijuanaconversation.org/">marijuanaconversation.org</a>, under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">BY-NC-ND license</a>. By releasing this information under a CC license (and with plans to utilize CC licenses more in the future), the ACLU is actively committing itself to the notion of "conversation," allowing for the legal and encouraged sharing of information.</p>
