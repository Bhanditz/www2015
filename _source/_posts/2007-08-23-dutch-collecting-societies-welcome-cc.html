<p>From <a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/nl/mensen/paul/index.html">Paul Keller</a> - <a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl">CC Netherlands</a> Project Lead:</p>
<p>On August 23, 2007, Dutch collecting societies Buma and Stemra and Creative Commons Netherlands <a href="http://creativecommons.nl/2007/08/23/cc-nl-start-pilot-flexibel-rechtenbeheer-samen-met-bumastemra/">launched a pilot project</a> that seeks to provide Dutch musicians with more opportunities to promote their own repertoire. This project enables members of <a href="http://www.bumastemra.nl">Buma/Stemra</a> to use the 3 non-commercial CC licenses for non-commercial distribution of their works. It also allows Dutch composers and lyricists who already use the CC NonCommercial license to join Buma/Stemra and have them collect their royalties for commercial use of their works.</p>
<p>Before now Dutch authors have not been able to make their work available online under the CC NC license while at the same time having Buma/Stemra collect their royalties for commercial use of those works. The Netherlands is the first country to bring such a collaboration between a music copyright organization and Creative Commons, a move applauded by Lawrence Lessig, the founder and chairman of Creative Commons International, as â€œthe first step towards more freedom of choice in the field of exploiting music works in the digital world.â€</p>
<p>The press release by Creative Commons Netherlands and Buma Stemra can be found <a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl/bumapilot/070823persbericht_en_web.pdf">here.</a> And for more information about what's going on in the Netherlands check out CC Netherlands <a href="http://www.creativecommons.nl">website</a>.</p>
