<p>Luxcommons has <a href="http://www.luxcommons.lu/?p=72">videos, pictures, and presentations</a> of Monday's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7737">CC Luxembourg launch</a>, as well as news of the first CC Luxembourg ported license user.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international">40th jurisdiction</a> to launch ported CC licenses!</p>

<p>Also congratulations to Jamendo, the CC music site headquartered in Luxembourg, for reaching <a href="http://blog.jamendo.com/index.php/2007/10/16/jamendo-is-a-hive-of-five-thousands-albums-5000/">5000 albums</a> on the same day. As <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2007/10/creative-common.html">John Buckman of Magnatune also presented at the launch</a>, Luxembourg was indisputably the capital of CC music entrepreneurialism, for at least that day.</p>
