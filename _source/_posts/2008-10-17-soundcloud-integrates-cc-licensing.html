<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a>, a new media sharing site aimed at musicians, has been receiving <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2008/10/09/soundcloud-here-like-flickr-for-music/">heaps of</a> <a href="http://www.wiretotheear.com/2008/06/21/soundcloud-is-a-nice-looking-way-to-share-music/">great press</a> since <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2008/10/10/live/">going live</a> last week. SoundCloud <a href="http://soundcloud.com/tour">allows musicians</a> to post their works easily, share them securely, interact with other musicians in a collaborative fashion, check stats on song listens/comments, and utilize a bevy of other useful features. Excitingly for the CC-community, SoundCloud announced today that users can now upload their works under a CC license <em>or</em> a public domain declaration. From <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2008/10/17/cc/">SoundCloud</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The CC license support on SoundCloud is pretty straight-forward. You can pick a license when you upload a track, and you can set a default license in your settings. There are three main modes; All Rights Reserved, Some Rights Reserved, and No Rights Reserved. The default is All Rights Reserved, which means you own all rights to the works you upload.</p>
<p>You can also select the Some Rights Reserved-option which will give you a nice interface where you can assemble your Creative Commons license. You can select whether Commercial use is ok, whether derivative works are ok, or whether derivative works should be â€œsharedâ€ alike, meaning derivative works should be shared under the same conditions. Read more about CC licenses here.<br />
[...]<br />
Lastly, thereâ€™s the No Rights Reserved-option if you want to let anybody do anything they like with your music.</p>
<p>A cool thing is that weâ€™ve also got RDFa support so that all license information will be properly encoded for machine-reading directly in the track pages.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We are super excited to see this sort of support happen as it should greatly increase the functionality of SoundCloud for CC-using musicians and open the doors for a new repository of CC-licensed music. That SoundCloud has successfully implemented <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10095">RDFa</a> (making them one of the first CC-using content directories to do so) is similarly exciting. Learn more about SoundCloud <a href="http://soundcloud.com/faqs">here</a> and if you are CC-using musician, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/signup">try it out</a> for yourself.</p>
