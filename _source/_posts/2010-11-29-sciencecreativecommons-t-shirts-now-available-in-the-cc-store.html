<p>November has been an exciting month for science at Creative Commons. Earlier this month we hosted a Creative Commons Salon in San Francisco on the promises and pitfalls of personalized medicine, which you can now watch <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/10887701">online</a>. We met a matching giving challenge by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24702">Hindawi</a>, the open access scholarly journal publisher (disciplines from neuroscience to pharmacology), who doubled $3000 in donations to our annual fundraising campaign. We also saw <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24752/">BioMed Central</a>, the world's largest OA publisher, provide in-kind support for our fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>The icing on the cake is the most recent addition to our CC Store: this super-cool science-themed CC shirt, for which the world-famous <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a> was gracious enough to let us re-use a variation on a classic cartoon. Many of you may already read and enjoy the delightful webcomic of â€œromance, sarcasm, math, and languageâ€ which is under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/">CC BY-NC</a> license. Now you can show your love for Creative Commons and science at the same time by buying one of these t-shirts, available for $20 over at the <a href="https://creativecommons.net/node/3100">CC store</a>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to XKCD for being such a wonderful and creative member of the CC community, and for freely sharing that creativity with the world.</p>
<p>At Creative Commons, we see a lot of potential for bringing open access to the world of science, whether it pertains to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24677">genomics research</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24447">scholarly journal publishing</a>, or <a href="https://creativecommons.net/superheroes/cern/">unraveling the mysteries of the universe</a>. </p>
<p><strong>If you love science as much as we do, then hurry over to the <a href="https://creativecommons.net/node/3100">CC Store</a> and get your limited edition shirt today!</strong></p>
