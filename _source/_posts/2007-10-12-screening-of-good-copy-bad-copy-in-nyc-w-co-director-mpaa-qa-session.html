<blockquote><p>If you have any interest in the future of our culture...If you are an artist who appropriates and who is working sometimes in fear...If you are a citizen who is forward thinking about our personal rights...<a href="http://blip.tv/file/359180">this is a movie you must watch</a>! And besides, it's online and showing for free. Do yourself a favor and learn something.</p></blockquote>
