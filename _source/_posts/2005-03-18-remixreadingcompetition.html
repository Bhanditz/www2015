<p><a href="http://www.remixreading.org/">Remix Reading</a> is holding a remix competition.  Here's an excerpt from their site:</p>
<p><i><br />
After an extremely successful launch event, Remix Reading is pushing the boundaries of the local cultural community with a remix competition. Over the next month, we want to see who can create the best remix of a piece of work already on the website.<br />
</i></p>
<p>There will be four winners, one in each category (audio, image, text, video). They will each receive the following great prizes:</p>
<p>
    * Your work on a LOCA Records compilation CD (if LOCA like it enough)<br />
    * A Creative Commons t-shirt <br />
    * A DVD full of great Creative Commons videos <br />
    * A copy me / remix me compilation CD <br />
    * A copy of the Wired CD and that issue of the Wired magazine <br />
    * A CD from LOCA Records <br />
    * Stickers, badges and fake tattoos</p>
<p>
The closing date is Monday 11th April and the winners will be announced on Friday 15th April. The competition is being judged by a panel from Remix Reading, Creative Commons and <a href="http://www.locarecords.com/index2.html">LOCA Records</a>.</p>
