<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne_%28musician%29">David Byrne</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno's</a> landmark sampling album <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_%28album%29">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a></em> was recently remastered and reissued with extensive liner notes, photos, and previously unreleased bonus tracks. To celebrate the release, Byrne and Eno launched <a href="http://www.bush-of-ghosts.com/">bush-of-ghosts.com</a> where the audio source files from two of the classic tracks from <em>Bush of Ghosts</em> â€” "A Secret Life" and "Help Me Somebody" â€” are offered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 license</a>, so you can (subject to the download terms of use) use them to make remixes. The site allows uploads and user ratings, as well as the ability to share videos you make for music on <em>Bush of Ghosts</em>.</p>
