Our global efforts focus not only on establishing new jurisdiction projects, but also on working closely with long-standing national projects to upgrade localized licenses and to strengthen the commons worldwide. <a href="http://creativecommons.pl/">CC Poland</a>, one of the earliest jurisdictions to found a national Creative Commons project, releases today its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/?lang=pl">set of Poland-specific CC licenses</a> at <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3">Version 3.0</a>, Creative Commons' most current license version.</p>
<p>The upgrade is significant for several reasons, one being that Version 3.0 encompasses <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5709">our long-held vision</a> of establishing a compatibility structure to allow interoperability between different flexible content copyright licenses. This structure has opened doors for important adopters, such as the Wikipedia community and Wikimedia Foundation, who recently <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14668">approved</a> the adoption the Creative Commons <a href="../licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0</a> (CC BY-SA) license as the main content license for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites.</p>
<p>The Polish upgrade to Version 3.0 was led by Alek Tarkowski, Justyna Hofmokl, and Krzysztof Siewicz and hosted at the <a href="http://www.icm.edu.pl/">Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling at Warsaw University (ICM UW) </a>and the <a href="http://www.gwmlegal.pl/">Grynhoff, WoÅºny and MaliÅ„ski Law Firm</a>. Through these efforts and more, CC Poland continues to build the local Creative Commons community and promote free culture.</p>
<p>An enormous thank you to CC Poland, to Alek, Justyna, and Krzysztof, for their invaluable efforts to support Polish creators and to improve Creative Commons' ever-growing international pool of free legal tools.</p>
