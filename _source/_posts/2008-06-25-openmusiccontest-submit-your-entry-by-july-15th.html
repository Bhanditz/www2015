<p>The doors are now open for <a href="http://www.openmusiccontest.org/bewerbung">submissions</a> to the fourth <a href="http://openmusiccontest.org">OpenMusicContest</a> (OMC), one of the largest live concerts for CC-licensed music. Participants may submit tracks of any musical genre by July 15, 2008. Stylistic diversity is desired, and all entries must be licensed under one of the six Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p>The organizers of the event, the <a href="https://www.asta-marburg.de/">AStA</a> student organization from <span id="parent-fieldname-description">Philipps University in Marburg</span>, explain that the OMC offers an attractive prize for its participants: artists score a large performance alongside a noteworthy headliner plus space on a <a href="http://www.openmusiccontest.org/sampler">sampler</a> featuring the best tracks of the contest. A gratis promotional CD will also be published in the magazine LinuxUser.</p>
<p>The OMC concert will take place in Marburg, Germany on October 17, 2008.</p>
