<p>Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society launched a new project last week: <a title="http://publius.cc/" href="http://publius.cc/" target="_self">Publius</a>. The Publius Project is a Web 2.0 version of the Federalist Papers, a collection of passionate essays written in support of the U.S. Constitution--mostly signed "Publius".Â </p>
<p>The <a title="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4303" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/4303" target="_self">Publius Project</a> "bringsÂ together a distinguished collection of Internet observers, scholars, innovators, entrepreneurs, activists, technologists, and still other experts to write short essays, foster a public dialogue, and create a durable record of how the rules of cyberspace are being formed -- with a view to affecting their future incarnations."</p>
<p>The most recent essay, posted today, is titled "Muddling Through Internet Governance".Â All essays are signed by their authors and licensedÂ <a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY</a>.</p>
