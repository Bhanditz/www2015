<p>CC founder <a href="http://lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a> recently released a new book titled, <em><a href="http://remix.lessig.org/">Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy</a></em>. The book will be his last solely devoted to the issues of copyright and in it, he aims to "map[] both a way back to the 19th century, and to the promise of the 21st" through the veil of copyright reform and content ownership. To celebrate, a book party is being held in San Francisco on October 29th, at which we will be present with a table brimming with schwag. Details below:</p>
<blockquote><p>WHEN: October 29 2008<br />
WHERE: W Hotel / 181 Third Street, San Francisco<br />
WHEN: 6:30PM Reception / 7PM Program</p></blockquote>
