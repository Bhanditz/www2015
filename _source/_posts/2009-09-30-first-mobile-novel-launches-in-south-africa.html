<p>Mobile phones are the most popular means of communication among young adults in South Africa, as South Africans send 250 million text messages a day. This may be true for many parts of the world, where Internet connections are still in dial-up mode or even nonexistent. Through mobile phones, youth carry daily conversations via text messaging, as in some areas it is cheaper to send a text than to call. </p>
<p>Leveraging the popularity of mobile phones, <a href="http://m4lit.wordpress.com/">the m4Lit project</a> has launched the first mobile novel of its kind, or m-novel, in South Africa. <a href="http://kontax.mobi/">Kontax</a>, which follows the adventures of a group of teenage graffiti artists, is made specifically for mobile phones, and is available in both English and isiXhosa. It is being released chapter by chapter on a daily basis, with the <a href="http://kontax.mobi/">first chapter</a> already out. From the <a href="http://www.emergingmedia.co.za/press-releases/kontax-%E2%80%93-shuttleworth-foundation%E2%80%99s-m4lit-project-launches-south-africa-30-september-2">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The m4Lit pilot project aims to explore whether teens are interested in reading stories on their cellphones, whether and how they write using their cellphones, and whether cellphones might be used to develop literacy skills and a love of reading. Enter Kontax, an m-novel written on commission from the Shuttleworth Foundation by prize winning â€˜mobilistâ€™ Sam Wilson. Kontax is an m-novel made for mobile â€“ and from 30 September readers will be able to access the dynamic teen narrative from their WAP-enabled cellphones, or from their computers. Every day another exciting chapter in the mystery plot will be told, with 21 chapters rolling out over 21 days. Teen readers will be invited to interact with Kontax as it unfolds on their cellphones: they can vote on and discuss the progressing plot, leave comments, download wallpapers and finally submit a written piece as part of a competition, with airtime prizes available for winning submissions.</p>
<p>...As part of the research component of this project, interviews with teens in Cape Town before and after the publishing of  Kontax will establish to what extent this project changes South African learners' attitudes to reading and writing, what learners think about m-novels, and whether the mobile medium as a literacy tool interests or excites them.</p>
<p><strong>Global perspective</strong><br />
In inviting interaction from and discussion amongst its teenage readers, Kontax is aligned with leading global trends, and follows the success of audience participation in story writing found in Japan, where teens have been reading and writing novels on their cellphones in this way for a number of years. The popularity of the m-novel is clearly evident in Japan, where six out of the top 10 fiction best sellers in 2008 were m-novels that had later been printed in book form. The evolution of digital media has had a profound impact on the literacy practices of teenagers from east to west â€“ in the USA, research has shown that through their computers today's teens are reading and writing more than ever, not formally but on blogs, MySpace pages and via instant messages. Increasingly, SMSes and chats on their cellphones also form part of the â€œreadingâ€ and â€œwritingâ€ of digital literacy."</p></blockquote>
