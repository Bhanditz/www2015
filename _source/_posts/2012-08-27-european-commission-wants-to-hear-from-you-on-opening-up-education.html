<p>The European Commission has opened a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/consult/open_en.htm ">public consultation period</a> on the topic of "Opening Up Education." The objective of the consultation is to explore the perceived need for EU action to promote the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) and of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in education. Interested stakeholders (including organizations, public bodies, citizens) can complete the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/ipm/forms/dispatch?form=OpeningUpEducation">questionnaire on this consultation</a>. </p>
<p>From the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/documents/consult/open_en.pdf">summary document</a> (PDF): </p>
<blockquote><p>While OER and the use of ICT in education are high on the agenda of policy makers in the educational sphere, OER and ICT have not yet reached a critical threshold to be fully exploited across all education and training sectors. Several actions have been undertaken over the years by the EU and Member States, but in a fragmented, short-term manner, without prospects for long-term sustainability. A comprehensive initiative at EU level could match the scope, size and complexity of the challenges, and respond to the increasing demand to tap into the potential of OER and ICT to modernize education. Such a strategy could provide a significant push to improve the way educational content is produced, accessed and used to teach, learn or connect with peers.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The consultation period ends 13 November 2012. Following on from the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/events/calendar-of-events/events-websites/World-Open-Educational-Resources-Congress">June 2012 UNESCO OER Declaration</a>, the EU consultation can be a productive vehicle for continuing the exploration of and support for Open Education in Europe and around the world. </p>
