<p>I am very happy to announce that our Japanese-law and -language licenses are now available for use from our site. Just select "Jurisdiction: Japan" when <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">choosing a license,</a> and the site will point you to the right document. For those with browsers set to English, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/jp/">Commons Deed</a> will appear <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/jp/deed.en">in English</a>. For those with broswers set to Japanese, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/jp/deed.ja">in Japanese</a>. And the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/jp/legalcode">underlying legal code</a> is in Japanese.</p>
<p>This is a major milestone for Creative Commons, and I'd like to extend a special thank you to <a href="http://www.glocom.ac.jp">GLOCOM</a> for driving <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/jp/">iCommons Japan</a>, to Yuko Noguchi and Emi Wakatsuki for their extraordinary efforts, and to <a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/machina/">Machina</a> for her keen insights at various points in the drafting process.</p>
