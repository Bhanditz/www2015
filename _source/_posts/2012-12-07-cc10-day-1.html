<p>Welcome to the very first day of Creative Commons' 10th birthday celebrations!</p>
<p>Over the next 10 days we will be celebrating CC's first decade with activities, events, tweets and competitions. As well as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35459">dozens of real world parties</a>, we've set up a dedicated <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org" target="_blank">CC10 website</a> as a hub for all things birthday. Each day on this site we will be showcasing highlights from the CC community - some of our favorite users, platforms and resources. Like an advent calendar, these featured items will be 'revealed' as each day of the CC10 website goes live, along with the events for that day and following days, and other exciting announcements and materials. You'll be able to navigate backwards to previous days using the dates at the top of the page.</p>
<p>We kick off our CC showcase today looking at the world of CC and text, with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35440">blog post</a> from one of CC's longest running and most vocal supporters - <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>. Cory introduces us to one of his favorite CC-licensed works, <a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2007/08/25/what-is-wetware/">Rudy Ruckerâ€™s Wetware books</a>, which he calls "the finest high-weirdness of the golden age of cyberpunk." We also bring you an interview with Taylor Pipes of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>, a digital document sharing platform with more than 25 million texts, an amazing 80% of which are CC-licensed. And finally, we give you all (or at least those of you who speak Swedish) a primer on the CC licenses, what they mean and which is best for you, with <a href="http://www.creativecommons.se/" target="_blank">CC Sweden</a>'s <a href="https://www.iis.se/docs/Creative-Commons-Webb.pdf" target="_blank">VÃ¤lj rÃ¤tt licens! poster</a>.</p>
