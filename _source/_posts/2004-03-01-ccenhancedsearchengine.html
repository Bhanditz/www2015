<p>Today we announce a <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org">search engine prototype</a> exclusively for finding Creative Commons licensed and public domain works on the web.</p>
<p>Indexing only pages with valid Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/usingmarkup">metadata</a> allows the search engine to display a visual indicator of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/licenses/">conditions</a> under which works may be used as well as offer the option to limit results to works available licenses allowing for derivatives or commercial use.</p>
<p>This prototype partially addresses one of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/challenges#challenge_entry_3845">tech challenges</a>.  It still needs lots of work.  If you're an interested developer you can obtain the code and submit bugs via the <a href="http://cctools.sourceforge.net">cctools project</a> at SourceForge. The code is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/">GNU GPL</a> licensed and builds in part upon Nathan Yergler's <a href="http://www.yergler.net/projects/ccrdf/">ccRdf</a> library.</p>
<p>We also have an outstanding challenge to commercial search engines to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/challenges#challenge_entry_3844">build support for Creative Commons-enhanced searches</a>.</p>
