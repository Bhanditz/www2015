<p>San Francisco, USA, Berlin, GERMANY - March 14, 2006</p>
<p>Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that provides a flexible copyright licenses for authors and artists, recently unveiled a localized version of its innovative licensing system in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the groupâ€™s <a href="http://creativecommons.org">website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with Project Leads Veni Markovski and Dessi Pefeva of the Internet Society Bulgaria, to adapt the standarized licenses to Bulgarian law. <a href="http://www.cc.isoc.bg">Creative Commons Bulgaria</a> is hosted by the Internet Society Bulgaria (ISOC-Bulgaria) and supported by the Open Society Institute.<br />
Says Veni Markowski, â€œWe are proud of the achievements of the Creative Commons community in Bulgaria. This is a success for Bulgaria, and for all authors - an ever increasing number of them use Creative Commonsâ€™ licenses to publish their works.â€œ</p>
<p>â€œThere are new CC initiatives every day in Bulgaria â€“ see <a href="http://www.open-culture.net/">open-culture.net</a><br />
or the Bulgarian netlabels - <a href="http://stretching-spaces.net/">stretching-spaces.net</a>, <a href="http://ouim.net/">ouim.net</a> and <a href="http://mahorka.cult.bg/">mahorka.cult.bg</a>. There's even a whole audiolab, called VOXXLab, which gives young musicians opportunity to record their music free of charge, if they license their music under CC", said Dessi Pefeva, CC project coordinator.</p>

<p>About Creative Commons</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licences provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various foundations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Omidyar Network Fund, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as members of the public.
