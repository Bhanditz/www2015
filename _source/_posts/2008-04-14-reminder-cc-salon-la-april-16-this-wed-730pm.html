<p>Just a reminder that this Wednesday (4/16) at 7:30PM we will be returning to <a href="http://www.foundla.com/sys/">FOUND LA</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1903+Hyperion+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90027,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title">Google Map</a>) for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Los_Angeles_Salon">another CC Salon LA</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://rexbruce.com/">Rex Bruce</a>, director of the <a href="http://www.lacda.com/">Los Angeles Center for Digital Art</a>, will be screening a video he directed that uses public domain imagery from the US Military (also playing at the <a href="http://www.centrepompidou.fr/Pompidou/Accueil.nsf/tunnel?OpenForm">Centre Pompidou</a>). <a href="http://www.hollywillis.com/">Holly Willis</a>, Director of Academic Programs at the <a href="http://iml.usc.edu/">Institute for Multimedia Literacy</a>, will be presenting on art in Second Life, focusing on creators who are cognizant of the formal and ideological implications of virtual worlds. </p>
<p>Jack Lerner, Acting Director at the <a href="http://law.usc.edu/academics/clinical/ip.cfm">USC Intellectual Property and Technology Law Clinic</a>, will give a talk on research he has been conducting in relation to music sampling that looks at defects in the market and proposes changes. Finally, we will be joined by multimedia designers <a href="http://www.weisbart.net/">Chris Weisbart</a> and Michael Wilson who will explain how they are using open source technology in museums and will give a live demonstration of a holographic projection system they've recently built into an interactive exhibit.</p>
<p>We are super excited for the diverse group of panelists we have got together, so come out and join us for what is bound to be an enlightening evening. And yes, there will be free (as in beer) drinks!</p>
