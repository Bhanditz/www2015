<p>We are thrilled to announce that Glenn Otis Brown has joined the Creative Commons board of directors.</p>
<p>Brown was CC's executive director from 2002-2005; as one of the core members of the CC team in our early days, he was critical in developing projects that provide the groundwork for the work we do today. Brown is currently YouTube's music business development manager and works with major and independent labels, publishers, and artists to build new business opportunities. In the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/16077">press release</a> we issued today to publicize this news, Creative Commons CEO Joi Ito says this of Brown:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œWe couldnâ€™t be more thrilled to have Glenn join the board. As Executive Director of the organization in its early days, Glenn established many of the critical ideas and relationships that CC is built upon today. That background, combined with his experience in developing creative projects and partnerships at YouTube, gives him particularly valuable insight into the opportunities for Creative Commons in the worlds of business, media, and culture at large.â€
