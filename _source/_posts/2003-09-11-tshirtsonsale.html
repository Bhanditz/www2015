<p>
If you've caught up with Creative Commons at any conferences or events this year, you've probably seen us wearing Creative Commons t-shirts. If you'd like to order one for yourself and help support our non-profit organization, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/store">we're now offering the same shirts for sale</a>. They are $20 including shipping to the US and Canada, available in medium, large and extra large sizes. The shirts are a light green Hanes Beefy T with a screenprinted logo on the front, "Some Rights Reserved" and URL on the back, and we're using Paypal to accept payments. Order soon, order often.</p>
