<p>I'm at the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/Default.htm">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a> today and tomorrow for an "open knowledge" grantees' meeting. It's striking (1) how large the group is this year and (2) how many other grantees are close friends of and collaborators with Creative Commons: <a href="http://archive.org">The Internet Archive</a>, <a href="http://cnx.rice.edu">Connexions</a>, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OpenCourseware</a>, <a href="http://wiley.ed.usu.edu/">David Wiley</a><a>, </a><a href="http://www.fhda.edu/">Foothill-De Anza Community College</a>, and more.</p>
<p>A good part of the network that I thought Creative Commons had built through scrappy business development seems to have been part of a Hewlett master plan. That's downright <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/">Willy Wonka</a> -- in a good way.</p>
