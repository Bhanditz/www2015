<p><img src="img/logo-1.png" alt="logo-1" width="145" height="73" style="float:right;padding:10px" /><a href="http://www.clivir.com/">Clivir</a>, a learning community site that allows users to post lessons of <a href="http://www.clivir.com/lessons/all.html">any and all</a> types, just added support for CC licensing. The site already has amassed a large amount of teachable knowledge and by adding CC licensing options Clivir are giving users the ability to keep this knowledge open, shareable, and reusable (depending on which license is indicated).</p>
<p>Clivir have a released all of their <a href="http://www.clivir.com/classrooms/show/clivir.html">own lessons</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/au/">CC BY-SA license</a>, setting a strong example for the rest of their community to follow suit. While the ability to filter lessons by license choice is unfortunately not available yet, it is still great to see CC licenses integrated into communities like Clivir that pride group collaboration and collective knowledge.</p>
