<a href="http://braithwaitewallets.com/">Braithwaite</a> creates men's wallets whose PDF designs are CC licensed. Their model really exemplifies the kind of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8095">thinking we're seeing a lot of these days</a> - set the digital versions free and offer the unique physical goods and experience for a price. Braithwaite <a href="http://www.braithwaitewallets.com/pages/39-creative-commons/">explains their decision as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As of April 14, 2009, we have used Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License to license our unique wallet designs allowing anyone to distribute, copy, or produce them as long as authorship credit is retained.  The right to use our designs does include commercial use.</p>
<p>Since there are no 'patents' in regards to the fashion industry, we have decided to blow the lid off with our work by making it freely available to anyone. This also allows our designers to retain the rights to their work.  When designers submit their work to us, we recommend that they first license it with Creative Commons to make sure their rights are protected.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can download the <a href="http://www.braithwaitewallets.com/designers">wallet designs on the pages of their respective designers</a>, and <a href="http://www.braithwaitewallets.com/wallets">orders begin shipping April 22nd</a>.</p>
