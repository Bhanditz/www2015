<p>Yesterday, I had the opportunity to speak at the <a href="http://osconf.kmdi.utoronto.ca/default.htm">Open Source and Free Software conference</a>, held by the <a href="http://kmdi.utoronto.ca/">Knowledge Media Design Institute</a> at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>
The conference was designed to explore the legal, moral, political, social, commercial, and technical perspectives of open source and free software, to build a broader understanding of the movement.</p>
<p>
I spoke on a panel entitled  <a href="http://osconf.kmdi.utoronto.ca/panel_education.html">Education and Public Knowledge: Open Access, Open Content</a>.  The aim of the panel was to understand how the lessons from open source and free software could help develop a thriving open-content ecosystem, within the context of education.</p>
<p>The entire conference will be online soon -- check it out!</p>
