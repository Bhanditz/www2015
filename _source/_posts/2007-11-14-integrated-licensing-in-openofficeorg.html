<p>Over the summer Creative Commons had the good fortune to participate in the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>.  One of our students, Cassio Melo, worked on developing an add-in for <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, similar to the one that existed for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Microsoft_Office_Addin">Microsoft Office</a>.  </p>
<p><img src="img/Screenshot-Select_a_License.png" /></p>
<p>Today I'm pleased to announce the fruits of Cassio's efforts.  We're releasing a beta release of the add-in which allows you to select and embed a license in Writer, Calc and Impress documents (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7820">press release</a>).  You can find download information as well as a screencast of the add-in in action on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Cassio for his hard work, as well as <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google</a> for supporting open source development.</p>
