<p>As <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7212">noted</a> in January, <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com">Black Sweater White Cat</a> has taken the CC music pick of the day baton. Last week they reached <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2007/04/httpwww2bloggercomimggllinkgifbswhttpww.html">100 picks</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://blocsonic.com">blocSonic</a> has released their fourth beautifully packaged netlabel compilation: <a href="http://blocsonic.com/blog/presenting_netbloc_volume_4_soundtrack_for_the_coming_revolution">Soundtrack for the Coming Revolution</a>. We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7202">mentioned</a> their first release, also only in January.</p>
<p>That's 141 CC-licensed picks from music lovers to music lovers, with some double counting, as there's <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2007/04/bswc-one-day-maniax-memori-its-not.html">cross fertilization</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7238">another</a>) <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/playlist/browse/44">100 CC BY hits</a>, <a href="http://www.hermann-uwe.de/podcast">Uwe Hermann's Music Podcast</a>, and ... you can be a CC tastemaker too!</p>
