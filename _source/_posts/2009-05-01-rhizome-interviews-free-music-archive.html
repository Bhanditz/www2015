The whole interview is worth a read, but Sigal's discussion of how CC licensed music can help U.S. radio stations is of particular note (Rhizome question in bold, Sigal's answer follows):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Was the move to bring together an international group of curators intentional? I ask this only because I feel the model of FMA is not only informed by the direction presented by web 2.0 technologies but it is also a response to outdated US copyright law and its impact on American radio stations. The reason why so many American broadcast stations are now turning to talk radio is because they are also trying to podcast their content online, and talk radio allows them to side step restrictions regarding music licensing and podcasts.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. (I just snapped my fingers in agree-ance!) Of course it's going to be international, that's the nature of the web. And that's one reason we offer Creative Commons licenses -- they adapt out-dated copyright law to fit the world wide web.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FMA has already become a fantastic resource for curated CC-licensed music and is a database that looks to continue to grow in quality and quantity over time - see featured curators <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/dublab/">dublab</a> and <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/CASH_Music/">CASH Music</a> for two prime examples.
