Thank you to <a href="http://www.20x200.com">20x200</a>, designer <a href="http://magicalnihilism.wordpress.com/">Matt Jones</a>, and everyone who supported CC by purchasing one of these special edition prints, released on April 7.  We are proud to announce that the edition did extremely well: all 200 of the 8x10 prints sold out within a day, and the other sizes available at different prices were very popular as well. There are still prints remaining, and all proceeds will continue to benefit CC, so if you would like to show some support for CC, head over to the <a href="http://www.20x200.com/art/2009/04/get-excited-and-make-things.html">20x200 site</a> and secure one of these exhibition-quality prints for yourself (they'd also make great gifts!): size 11"x14" for $50, 16"x20" for $200, and 24"x30" for $1,000.</p>
<p>We are delighted that Matt Jones has chosen Creative Commons to benefit from the sale of his special edition prints, and as always, we thank everyone who has supported CC over the years, allowing us to continue our work supporting artists, educators, scientists, and creators of all kinds all over the world. </p>
