<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Paul_Brest_Creative_Commons_chair.pdf"><strong>Read the full press release. (PDF)</strong></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m delighted to announce that Paul Brest has been elected chair of the Creative Commons board. Paul will begin as chair in December, coinciding with CC&#8217;s <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org">tenth anniversary celebrations</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Paul has bridged the worlds of law, philanthropy, and academia, most recently as president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and, before that, dean of Stanford Law School. He&#8217;s widely recognized as an expert on constitutional law, problem solving and decision making, and philanthropic strategy, having written books and taught classes at Stanford on these subjects.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of a better choice than Paul. He has that rare combination of strong instincts and the knowledge and rigor to back those instincts up. He&#8217;s the leader we need to carry CC into the next decade.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to take this opportunity to recognize <a href="http://creativecommons.org/board#joiito">Joi Ito</a> for his years of service as chair. During Joi&#8217;s time as chair, he&#8217;s helped CC grow as an organization, both in global influence and in its relevance to a changing technology landscape.</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking Joi and welcoming Paul.</p>
