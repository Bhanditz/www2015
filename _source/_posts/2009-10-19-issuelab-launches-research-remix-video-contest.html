<p><a href="http://www.issuelab.org/">IssueLab</a>, "an open source archive of research produced by nonprofit organizations, university-based research centers, and foundations," launches their <a href="http://www.issuelab.org/researchremix">Research Remix Video Contest</a> this week. The contest "aims to engage working artists and digital media students with social issues while encouraging nonprofits to make their research more broadly available and usable through open licensing." If you recall my <a href="http://creativecommons.org/featured-projects/2009/06/16/15168">interview</a> with co-founder Lisa Brooks earlier this year, a good chunk of IssueLab's research is licensed under one of the Creative Commons licenses. From the press release,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Contestants will be asked to remix facts or data from one of over 300 openly licensed research<br />
reports on IssueLab into a video or animation under three minutes in length. Winners will be selected<br />
after the December 31, 2009 deadline, and nonprofits will be able to use all submitted videos freely to<br />
support their causes. </p>
<p>The launch of "Research Remix" coincides with Open Access Week, an international movement that<br />
pushes for broad and free access to research findings and publicly funded studies. IssueLab's official<br />
participation is marked by its continued commitment to bringing open access and licensing to the<br />
social and policy research fields. "It is especially important that nonprofits consider openly licensing<br />
their research and resources. By giving people the ability to re-use, remix, and share research on<br />
social issues we can much better inform and engage public debate and public policy."</p></blockquote>
<p>We encourage you to <a href="http://www.issuelab.org/researchremix">remix</a> and submit your videos by the year's end, especially because all finalists receive a free CC t-shirt and buttons (not to mention first prize is a netbook). I'm also one of the judges, so I look forward to your submissions!</p>
