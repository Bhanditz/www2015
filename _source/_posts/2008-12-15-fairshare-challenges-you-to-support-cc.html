<p>We're thrilled to announce the third and final matching challenge of the <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">2008 annual campaign</a>!  This round's matcher is <a href="http://www.fairshare.cc">FairShare</a>, a new service from <a href="http://www.attributor.com">Attributor</a>.  FairShare is putting up $3000 in order to match every single donation (up to $3000) between now and the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>FairShare was previewed at <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12">CC's 2nd Technology Summit</a> on Friday.  FairShare is a free service that lets you assign a CC license to your work and receive information on how and where it is shared with others.  Results come back as an RSS feed and include information about the percentage of your work re-used, whether a link back exists and if ads are present. Support for Share-Alike and No Derivatives licenses are expected soon.  FairShare is currently in beta, and they are looking for help testing <a href="http://www.fairshare.cc">http://www.fairshare.cc</a>.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity to double the value of your contribution to CC. The end of the campaign is quickly approaching and we need your help -- <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">donate today</a>!</p>
