<p>We are excited to announce today the launch of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international">International Commons</a> project.   The goal of the International Commons is to "port" our licenses to operate in the legal systems (and languages) of countries across the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#18">Christiane Asschenfeldt</a>, a copyright expert and the newest member of the Creative Commons team, will coordinate the effort from Berlin.</p>
