<blockquote>The <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio">Creative Remix</a>, with host <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=benjamen+walker&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Benjamen Walker</a>, is an hour-long "lawyer free" examination of the art, culture, and history of the remix. The hour kicks off with a musical analysis of DJ Dangermouse's infamous remix of the Beatles and Jay-Z. Then we go back in time to check out the ancient Roman art of the poetry mash-up, or the Cento. Then we rewind to the 18th century to check out the birth of copyright and how it affected writers like Alexander Pope; and the early 20th century when the visual artist Marcel Duchamp used the remix to reinvent everything. We also take a field trip to the Mass Mocca museum of modern art to check out the exhibit "Yankee Remix." Walker brings along a few grad students and a pair of curmudgeonly New England antique collectors to investigate different attitudes towards remixing.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the second part of the program Walker speaks with three unique remix artists: The historical novelist Matthew Pearl, Gideon D'arcangelo ("The Walkman Buster"), and Cory Arcangel, a Nintendo hacker -- and one of the youngest representatives at this yearâ€™s Whitney Biennial.</p></blockquote>
<p>Benjamen Walker did the original music and sound design for <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org">our two animations</a>. His weekly radio program "The Theory of Everything" can be heard on <a href="http://www.wzbc.org">WZBC</a> in Boston and, beginning Oct 31st, <a href="http://www.kalw.org">in San Francisco</a> and <a href="http://www.toeradio.org">on the Internet.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio">Listen to the show</a> -- it will enlighten even the confirmed appropriationist afficionado. If you like it, <a href="http://www.publicradiofan.com/statsearch.html">contact your local public radio station</a> and tell them about this opportunity to provide their audience with a "lawyer free" look at the art form of the remix.</p>
