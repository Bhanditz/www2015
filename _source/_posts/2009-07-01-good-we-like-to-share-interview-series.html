This past December, I conducted a series of interviews with people about the value of sharing information and resources in their respective fields of work. The interviews were edited into a podcast for <a href="http://www.good.is/"><em>GOOD</em></a> entitled "We Like to Share" that was made available to people who attended the <a href="http://awesome.good.is/december/">GOOD December</a> series of events in Los Angeles. Last week, <em>GOOD</em> began posting <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">CC BY-licensed</a> text versions of the interviews on <a href="http://www.good.is/series/we-like-to-share">its website</a> and will roll out one a week over the next few months. The first interview is with <a href="http://www.good.is/post/chris-hughes-on-the-political-value-of-sharing/">Chris Hughes</a>, one of the co-founders of Facebook, who was the online strategist for the Barack Obama campaign. Check back at <a href="http://www.good.is/series/we-like-to-share">"We Like to Share"</a> each Thursday (starting tomorrow) to read interviews with iconic sharers like Jimmy Wales, Chris Dibona, Frances Pinter, Jesse Dylan, and Curt Smith.</p>
