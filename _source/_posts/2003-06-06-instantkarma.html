<p>À€I'm at the <a href="http://www.hri.uci.edu">University of California @ Irvine's Humanities Research Institute</a> talking with some good folks about humanities education and technology.</p>
<p>I did a short presentation about Creative Commons this morning, and by the time I'd wrapped up, conference participant <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/People/futrelle">Joe Futrelle</a>, who is technical lead of <a href="http://dlt.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">Digital Library Technologies</a> at <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/About/NCSA/">NCSA</a>, had licensed several of his own <a href="http://www.schneertz.com/roar/">tunes</a>. Joe says he wishes our licensing process were even quicker.</p>
