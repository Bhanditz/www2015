<p>CC is making a strong presence in Barcelona at the many open culture and education events that are taking place in the next couple weeks. Board members Catherine Casserly and Esther Wojcicki, CEO Joi Ito, CTO Nathan Yergler, International Project Manager Michelle Thorne, Open Society Foundation (OSF) Policy Fellow Timothy Vollmer, myself, and a slew of CC Affiliates from all over will be participating in the Open Ed Conference, first Mozilla Drumbeat Festival, Free Culture Forum/oXcars, and Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) Workshop. Some preview highlights and invitations to join us at specific events:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/festival/program">Mozilla Drumbeat Learning, Freedom and the Web Festival</a></strong> (3-5 Nov)<br />
The Mozilla Drumbeat Festival "will gather teachers, learners and technologists from around the world who are at the heart of [the open] revolution." It will consist of designated spaces, or "tents", with specific focuses, like building peer-2-peer courses (part of the Peer Learning Lighthouse), designing badges to recognize informal learning (Badge Lab), and fusing Wikipedia with education (Wikipedia lounge). You can check out the evolving schedule <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/schedule">here</a>, but we'll be hosting the following spaces, where we encourage you to join us:</p>
<p><em><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/Educating_your_users">Encourage Content Reuse: Educate your users!</a></em> (4-5 Nov)<br />
This session addresses the lack of education around openly licensed content and its associated freedoms--how to use, adapt, and remix content to realize the full collaborative potential that is enabled by CC licenses. We will discuss, collaborate, and create educational resources for users of open content. Specific outcomes include a reuse/remix guide for P2PU or other content and DIY license tutorials. The reuse/remix guide will lay the foundation for a â€œreusableâ€ template that other initiatives can customize to educate their users. DIY license tutorials can be on the "open" subject of your choice, whether it's a particular CC license, open educational resources (OER) in general, what is â€œopenâ€ anyway?, or org-specific policy (ie. why did P2PU choose CC BY-SA?) in the form of short video, pictures, or design---basically, how would you explain open licensing to your parents?</p>
<p><em><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/Building_a_School_of_Copyright_and_Creative_Commons">Building a School of Copyright &amp; Creative Commons</a></em> (4-5 Nov)<br />
Building on P2PU's Copyright 4 Educators courses, this is a planning session to discuss how to extend the current network of educators of copyright and Creative Commons. This may involve issues such as recruitment for more course facilitators, collaboration with CC affiliates around the world, and building a "School of Copyright and Creative Commons" at P2PU that would serve as the umbrella for all related courses and programs around copyright education. What other audiences besides educators should we focus on, and how do we leverage the international network of CC affiliates to reach more jurisdictions?</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Joi will be giving the opening keynote to the festival. The full (also evolving) list of drumbeat activities is available at <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/activities">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Drumbeat/events/Festival/program/activities</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://openedconference.org/2010/">Open Ed 2010</a></strong> (2-4 Nov)<br />
The annual Open Ed conference is "the worldâ€™s premiere venue for research related to open education" and this year's theme is "OER: Impact and Sustainability". Board member Catherine Casserly will present "Open Educational Resources and the Bullâ€™s-Eye: Opening Access to Knowledge AND Improving Teaching and Learning," CTO Nathan Yergler will lead a session on "Search and Discovery: OER's Open Loop," which focuses on <a href="http://discovered.creativecommons.org">DiscoverEd</a>, a prototype for scalable search of educational resources online, and OSF Policy Fellow Timothy Vollmer will present the "iNACOL survey: An inquiry into OER projects, practices, and policy in U.S. K-12 schools."</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wiki.p2pu.org/Workshop2010">P2PU Workshop 2010</a></strong> (27-30 Oct)<br />
The second P2PU workshop will focus on the future of the Peer 2 Peer University, including issues of education around open licensing, accreditation, community norms and review processes, governance, sustainability, larger "schools" of courses, and general peer-produced mayhem. Active workshoppers include Neeru Paharia (former CC Executive Director) and myself, in addition to a "friends of P2PU" day where CC board member Catherine Casserly will contribute her expertise and support.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://2010.fcforum.net/en">Free Culture Forum</a> and <a href="http://oxcars10.exgae.net/en">oXcars 2010</a></strong> (28-31 Oct)<br />
The Free Culture Forum is "an international arena in which to build and coordinate action around issues related to free/libre culture and access to knowledge." It "brings together key organizations and active voices in the spheres of free/libre culture and knowledge, and provides a meeting point where we can find answers to the pressing questions behind the current paradigm shift." oXcars 2010 is the free culture awards ceremony that will take place at the beginning of the forum, recognizing international artists and performers, including those of Spanish culture.</p>
<p>Barcelona was also host to the sixth <a href="http://www.communia-project.eu/">COMMUNIA</a> workshop earlier this month, which focused on "<a href="http://www.communia-project.eu/ws06">Memory Institutions and Public Domain</a>."</p>
<p>We hope to see you at one or all of these events, and if not, stay tuned for updates in November.</p>
