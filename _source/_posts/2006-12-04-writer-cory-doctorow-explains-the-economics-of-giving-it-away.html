<p>In a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/technology/2006/11/30/cory-doctorow-copyright-tech-media_cz_cd_books06_1201doctorow.html">recent article</a> in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/">Forbes.com</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> explains the impact of using Creative Commons licenses for him as a writer.  Cory has used CC licenses on many of his writings â€” from his books (available <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">here</a>) to his postings on <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>.  We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/text/doctorow">featured</a> him back in October 2005.  The Forbes article offers a great overview of some of the questions and concerns many authors who are thinking about using CC licenses have including how to convince your publisher, what will be the impact on book sales and other potential benefits from flexible licensing.</p>
