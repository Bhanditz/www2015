<p>More very exciting news from <a href="http://www.nin.com/">Nine Inch Nails</a>: Just two months after the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8095">Creative Commons-licensed release</a> of NIN's <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/"><em>Ghosts I-IV</em></a>, the band has released another album, entitled <em><a href="http://theslip.nin.com/">The Slip</a></em>, also under CC terms. NIN has this to say about <em>The Slip</em>, which, like its predecessor, is available under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike</a> license.</p>
<blockquote><p>we encourage you to<br />

etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>We'll have more to say about this great news soon.</p>
