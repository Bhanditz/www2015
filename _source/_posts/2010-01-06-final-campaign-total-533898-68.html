<p><strong>THANK YOU</strong> to everyone who <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donated</a> to our annual fundraising campaign, who bought swag from our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/store">online store</a>, and who helped <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/spread">spread the word</a> to friends and colleagues asking for their support of CC over the past three months. Thanks to you, we were able to meet and exceed our goal, raising a total of $533,898.68 from individuals, family foundations, and companies around the world. We are honored to have so much support, despite a grim economic climate and amidst calls of support from so many worthy causes. </p>
<p>In the spirit of transparency, here's a more precise breakdown of the funds we raised during this campaign. We had a greater number of donations from individual supporters - users, advocates, and friends of Creative Commons just like you - than in any previous year; 1,296 individuals from countries around the world contributed whatever amount they were able in support of the commons, giving a total of $234,798.68. While this number is larger than it ever has been before, it is still relatively tiny compared to the scope and breadth of Creative Commons and the number of users and CC licenses (over a quarter of a billion) that currently exist in the world. We're hoping to see this gap narrow as Creative Commons becomes more self-sustaining, with our users and supporters giving enough back to the organization to support our core operations. </p>
<p>This year's corporate support came from the following companies and totaled $237,500:<br />

<hr />
<p>We asked our supporters to fill out a questionnaire and tell us why they chose to support CC this year. Here is what a few of you had to say:</p>
<p>
<em>"I strongly believe in new ways of licensing creativity."</em><br />
<em>"I believe the commons is important for culture and society."</em><br />
<em>"CC is needed to change the creative world from being self protective to being open and sharing." </em><br />
<em>"Because I fervently believe in personal freedom and CC is about Freedom."</em><br />
<br />
If you donated this year, but missed the questionnaire, I encourage you to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/survey/campaign">fill it out</a> so that we can continue to improve our fundraising and awareness efforts. </p>
<p><strong><em>We always welcome your support.</em></strong> We expect 2010 to be a year of many exciting projects and milestones - you can help ensure that by <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donating</a>, <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/store">buying swag</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">licensing your creative works</a> and using <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">CC-licensed material</a>. </p>
