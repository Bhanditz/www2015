<p><img src="img/beasts_of_ny.jpg" alt="beasts_of_ny" title="beasts_of_ny" width="300" height="125" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />A little over two years ago <a href="http://www.crimewriterscanada.com/cwc/pages/pastawards.html">award-winning</a> novelist Jon Evans released <em><a href="http://www.beastsofnewyork.com/">Beasts Of New York</a></em>, a self-described "children's book for adults", online and for free under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works license</a>. He chose this license to help facilitate sharing, a decision we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7595">elaborated upon</a> previously:</p>
<blockquote><p>Evans wanted to write and release a novel his publishers found unmarketable. As he puts it, â€œtry to imagine telling people with a financial interest in your writing success that you want to write a whole book about a squirrelâ€. Evans saw CC-licenses and online publishing as a means to allow his work be read freely, while at the same time retaining potential commercial avenues for the book (Evans â€œcautiously expect[s] [Beasts of New York] to eventually find a publisherâ€).</p></blockquote>
<p>It is <a href="http://rezendi.com/blog/2009/10/squirrels-on-parade.html">now apparent</a> that Evans' optimism was well merited - <em>Beasts of New York</em> will see a physical release through Canadian literary press <a href="http://www.porcupinesquill.ca/">The Porcupine's Quill</a> early next year, largely based on the online traction the novel received. <em>Beasts of New York</em> has been downloaded legally around 6,000 times from <a href="http://feedbooks.com/userbook/2976">Feedbooks</a> and <a href="http://manybooks.net/titles/evansjother07beasts_of_new_york.html">Manybooks</a> and has become Evans' most-popular and highest-rated book on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43551.Jon_Evans">Goodreads</a>.</p>
