<p>Microsoft CTO Ray Ozzie <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/rayozzie/Blog/cns!1pyct_cYtbBtOBPDVAumMEdw!175.entry">writes</a> that Microsoft has released <a href="">another</a> RSS extension specification under CC:</p>
<blockquote><p>One other important point: We're releasing the SSE specification under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license â€“ <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Attribution-ShareAlike</a>.<br />
I'm very pleased that Microsoft is supporting the Creative Commons<br />
approach; you can see more about this at in the licensing section at<br />
the end of the spec.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It's great to see positive recognition of Creative Commons at a high level in Microsoft.</p>
<p>The spec released is meant to making sharing (in the technical sense of data exchange) of calendars and contact lists <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/rayozzie/Blog/cns!1pyct_cYtbBtOBPDVAumMEdw!175.entry">really simple</a> by building on data formats used to syndicate blogs.</p>
<p>Sharing calendars and contact lists, though conceptually very simple, turns out to be hard, as evinced by the lack of widely adopted solutions that work outside of a single website or corporate network. Sort of reminds one of the <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/getcreative/">conceptual simplicity and harsh reality of sharing creative works</a>, though the obstacles, largely technical and legal respectively, are very different (though something like "standards politics" plays a role in each).</p>
<p>Note that Creative Commons' office <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4342">neighbors</a> are also working on interoperable calendar and contact list sharing.</p>
