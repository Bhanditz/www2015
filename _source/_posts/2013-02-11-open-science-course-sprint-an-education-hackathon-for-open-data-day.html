<h3>An Education Sprint</h3>
<p>The future of Open is a dynamic landscape, ripe with opportunities to increase civic engagement, literacy, and innovation.  Towards this goal, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/science" title="creativecommons.org/science">Science Program</a> at Creative Commons is teaming up with the <a href="http://okfn.org/" title="okfn.org">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and members of the Open Science Community to facilitate the building of an open online course, an Introduction to Open Science.  The actual build will take place during a hackathon-style â€œsprintâ€ event on <a href="http://opendataday.org" title="opendataday.org">Open Data Day</a> on Saturday, February 23rd and will serve as a launch course for the <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/" title="schoolofopen.org">School of Open</a> during <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36266" title="creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36266">Open Education Week</a> (Mar 11-15).</p>

<h3>Want to help us build this?</h3>
<p>The course will be open in itâ€™s entirety, the building process and content all available to be worked on, all to help people learn about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science" title="wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a>.  Do you know a thing or two about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access" title="wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">Open Access</a>?  Are you a researcher whoâ€™s practicing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research" title="wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research">Open Research</a>?  Do you have experience in instructional or visual design?  This is an all-hands event and will be facilitated by representatives at CC, OKFN, and others in the Community.  Open Science enthusiasts in the Bay Area are invited to the CC Headquarters in Mountain View for the live event.  Remote participants will also be able to join and contribute online via Google Hangout.</p>
<p>The day will begin with coffee, refreshments and a check-in call with other <a href="http://wiki.opendataday.org/2013/City_Events" title="Open Data Day wiki, events list">Open Data Day Hackathons</a> happening around the globe.  The Open Science Community is strengthened by shared interests and connections between people, which we hope will grow stronger through networked events on Open Data Day.  The Open Science course sprint at CC HQ will build upon open educational content, facilitate the design of challenges for exploration, and provide easy entry for learners into concepts of Open Access, Open Research, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data" title="wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">Open Data</a>.  It will be done in a similar fashion to other <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34550" title="School of Open builds curriculum at Creative Commons Palo AltoÂ meeting">â€œsprint-styleâ€ content-creation events</a>, with lunch and refreshments provided for in-person participants.  Weâ€™re literally going to be hacking on education.  Sound like something youâ€™d be interested in?</p>

<h3>Developers</h3>
<p>We need you, too!  Basic skills for working with open datasets is important, and can be difficult to grasp.  Who better to develop great lessons about working with data than you?  Similarly, for those interested in building upon apps and projects from other Open Data Events, updated source code and repository information will be posted to a public feed (for now, follow hashtags <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODHD13" title="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODHD13">#ODHD13</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opendataday" title="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opendataday">#opendataday</a> on Twitter).  </p>
