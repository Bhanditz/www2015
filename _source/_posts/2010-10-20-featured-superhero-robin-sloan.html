<p>This year we're letting some of our exceptional CC Superheroes tell you in their own words why they support Creative Commons and why <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">you should too</a>. The first is Robin Sloan, a writer who works at the intersection of storytelling and technology. Here is his story. Join Robin in <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">supporting Creative Commons with a donation today.</a></p>

<p><strong>"I'm a writer you probably haven't heard of. But if I'm right about Creative Commons, and about the way books and culture work &mdash; and if I'm a little bit lucky &mdash; then your kids will read my stuff. And their kids too.</strong></p>
<p>Let me bring you up to speed:</p>
<p>Just about a year ago, I used a site called Kickstarter to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robinsloan/robin-writes-a-book-and-you-get-a-copy">gather a posse of patrons</a> and, in the span of about two months, wrote and published a short novel. It featured a character named Annabel Scheme, a sort of Sherlock Holmes for the 21st century.</p>
<p>After it was finished, I mailed the books off to my backers &mdash; about a thousand copies, total &mdash; and then put the PDF online, <a href="http://robinsloan.com/annabel-scheme">for free</a>, with a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 license.</p>
<p>Often, that's where this story ends. Triumph! Success! Righteous sharing! Right?</p>
<p>I actually think there's another step. So I'll explain what I did next, and then I'll explain why.</p>
<p>I had a chunk of change left over from the printing &mdash; around $2,000 &mdash; so I turned it into a Remix Fund. I polled my patrons for interesting ways to reimagine the story I'd just published, and interesting people to do the reimagining. I got a small avalanche of suggestions, each with a small budget attached, and so <a href="http://robinsloan.com/2010/1086">we all voted on it</a>. The winners included <a href="http://robinsloan.com/2010/1677">a singer/songwriter</a> and <a href="http://robinsloan.com/2010/1310">a 3D artist</a>. They did their thing, and now there's an Annabel Scheme song and a stunning set of images of her alternate San Francisco. (And, in true CC spirit, the raw 3D models can be downloaded and reused, as well.)</p>

<p>But why bother? Why not just wait for people to discover the book, get inspired, and remix it under their own steam? Isn't that more legit?</p>
<p>Maybe. But for me, Creative Commons is a survival strategy.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing about a book is not actually the book. Instead, it's the people who have assembled around it. It's everyone who's ever read it, and everyone who's ever re- or misappropriated it. It's everyone who's ever pressed it into someone else's hands. (That's another thing about Creative Commons: it supports not just remixing, but sharing, too. I publish in Amazon's Kindle store as well, and I love it &mdash; but if you buy one of my stories over there, you can't ever give it to anyone else.)</p>
<p>Anyway, it's that group of people that makes a book viable, both commercially and culturally. And without them &mdash; all alone, with only its author behind it &mdash; a book is D.O.A.</p>
<p>So I'm utterly intent on assembling that group, on nurturing it, making it passionate and resilient, and I'll use every tool at my disposal to do so: Kickstarter, <a href="http://robinsloan.com">my site</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/robinsloan">Twitter</a>, a Creative Commons license, and a Remix Fund to boot.</p>
<p>Did it work for "Annabel Scheme"? It's too early to tell. There's been more remixing since that first flurry &mdash; there's <a href="http://github.com/scottjacksonx/hu">this software project</a>, and I just learned last week that there's a comic in the works, too.</p>
<p>If you aspire to create culture today, in the year 2010, you cannot escape the vastness of it all &mdash; the sheer quantity of stuff that is being produced, and the sheer quantity of stuff that is being forgotten. In a world like this, Creative Commons is not just a license &mdash; not just a passive agreement with some theoretical public. Instead, I think it's an active, urgent signal to a posse of potential allies.</p>
<p>It says: I want this thing to succeed, but I need your help.</p>
<p>And it says: join me. Make this yours, too.</p>
<p><strong>So please join me in <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">supporting Creative Commons</a></strong>. After all, we've got a lot of kids and grandkids to entertain."</p>
