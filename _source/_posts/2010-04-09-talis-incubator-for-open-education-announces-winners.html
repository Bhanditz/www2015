<p>Talis Education <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/education/2010/04/08/winners-of-the-talis-incubator-for-open-education-fund-announced/">announced</a> the first round of project winners yesterday for its <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/education/incubator/">Talis Incubator for Open Education</a>. If you recall, I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17005">pointed out</a> the Talis Angel Fund for Open Education last year, which was set up "to further the cause of Open Education through the use of technology." Talis awarded Â£1,000-Â£15,000 to three projects for the first round: Drawtivity, Moodle Course Repository, and TwHistory. The Moodle Course Repository proposes "to build a repository of every course ever created on Moodle, a leading open source Virtual Learning Environment." According to team leader, Joseph Thibault, it would "give users an easier way to share their content and find new course templates, resources and Creative Commons licensed materials."</p>
<p>If you have a CC licensed project you'd like funded, the deadline for the second round is June 31st. See the <a href="http://blogs.talis.com/education/incubator/">website</a> for more details.</p>
