The celebration begins today with a <a href="http://dublab.com/">ten-day series</a> of events that includes live music, art installations, film screenings, and a variety of happenings that showcase dublab's breadth and depth as an arts organization. </p>

The event runs from 7PM-11PM at Continental Gallery in Downtown LA (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=400+S+Spring+St+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=A">Google Map</a>) and will feature live t-shirt printing, video booths, and a pop-up shop in addition to original art. The gallery will remain open (including the pop-up shop) Wednesday through Sunday, 12PM-8PM, throughout October.</p>
