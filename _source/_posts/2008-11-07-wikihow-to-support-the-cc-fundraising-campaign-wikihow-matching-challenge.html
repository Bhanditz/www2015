<p>Following <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10135">Safe Creative's</a> lead, <a href="http://wikihow.com/">wikiHow</a> has decided to help rally the community around <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">supporting Creative Commons</a> by issuing their own giving challenge. For the next two weeks, wikiHow will be matching every donation dollar for dollar, up to $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="http://wikihow.com/">wikiHow</a> is a collaborative writing project aiming to create the world's largest, highest quality how-to manual.  It is similar to <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> in that thousands of volunteer editors from all over the world write, edit and maintain the articles. </p>
<p>As I stated in this month's edition of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10331">ccNewsletter</a>, we need increased innovation and creative problem solving on a global level, now more than ever. wikiHow is one project working to help provide creative solutions to everyday problems. And the reason it works so well is because it was designed as an open system. Contributors are able to contribute and users are able to use and remix freely and legally because wikiHow is licensed with Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p>We're thrilled that wikiHow has decided to support CC in this way.  There's less than two months left in the campaign and we still have $434,495 to raise. <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/join">Please take advantage of their generous offer and double the value of your gift</a>.</p>
