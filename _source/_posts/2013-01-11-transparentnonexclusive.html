<p>Two days ago Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5424">announced</a> a pro-bono marketing campaign with BzzAgent.  Most of the feedback on this campaign has been negative, starting with <a href="http://www.corante.com/strange/archives/2005/04/30/oh_dear_creative_commons_shack_up_with_bzzagents.php">this post</a> (follow the comments and trackbacks from there for more).</p>
<p>I gather there are roughly two criticisms.  One is that '<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/magazine/05BUZZ.html?ex=1259989200&en=6dc3f3878659a642&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">word of mouth</a>' marketing is unbecoming, particularly for an organization that in the words of the blog cited above "is supposed to be about cutting out the corporate bullshit."</p>
<p>Well, yes, Creative Commons is many things to many people, from a provider of tools that cut transaction costs for creative reuse and innovation to a worldwide movement for free culture to a welcome respite from corporate media ... bullshit.</p>
<p>I hadn't heard of word of mouth marketing or BzzAgent before this morning (no surprise: I don't follow marketing) and will reserve judgement on the phenomena for now. More information will appear on this blog from others over the next few days, but in the interest of transparency here's a list of stuff that will apparently be included in Creative Commons BzzAgent kit: flyers, a dvd, stickers, buttons and a t-shirt (I understand that we sent BzzAgent 100 of the last).</p>
<p>The second criticism of a CC/BzzAgent campaign is that it indicates that we've given up on authentic grassroots uptake and are showing disrespect to the huge community of people who selflessly support and promote Creative Commons because it is something they really believe in.</p>
<p>This criticism, to the extent it is distinct from the first, strikes me as wrongheaded. Creative Commons is promoted through many avenues. A <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people">handful</a> of people work on it full time. Partner institutions <a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/">around the world</a> are working to port and promote Creative Commons licenses within their respective jurisdictions. We work with many (the following links are only samples) <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5356">companies</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">publications</a> and other <a href="http://archive.org">nonprofits</a> to promote and enhance Creative Commons usage. There's an organized <a href="http://www.freeculture.org/">student movement</a> promoting Creative Commons. And there is a vast, unorganized and unaffiliated community out there who promote Creative Commons through using our licenses, spreading the word, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">giving money</a> and even occasionally <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/challenges">writing code</a>.</p>
<p>Does trying a new promotion mean that we've given up on any of the above? Of course not! Each new initiative, particularly where commercial interests are involved, is a sensitive experiment. I've lost count of the number of such experiments that we've rejected, and I probably only know about a fraction of them. You wouldn't believe the volume of crazies and opportunists (often both) who want to "do something" with Creative Commons. Well, maybe you would.</p>
<p>Any one of the experiments we do act on is non-exclusive. Engaging in them does not mean that we've given up on or disresepct the movement or community aspects any more than companies such as Red Hat and IBM paying developers to work on open source and free software is a sign of disrespect to those who write free software on their own.</p>
