<p><img src="img/4198118_c6c1.png" alt="" title="4198118_c6c1" width="250" height="202" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22454" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />Yesterday <a href="http://aviary.com/blog/posts/online-music-creator">Aviary released</a> a brand new music creation tool, codenamed <strong>Roc</strong>. Roc employs a straight-forward grid-based interface that enables Aviary users of all musical backgrounds to create compositions easily. Most exciting to the CC community is that the instrument library accompanying Rock is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution license</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Best of all, completed music made using our instrument library can be used by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial. We spent considerable time and money developing this library ourselves and have decided to give back to the community by releasing use of mixed sounds from our library under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Generic license</a>.</p>
<p>We feel that by providing this tool without any commercial restrictions we will help the Internet cultivate and create an alternative shared library of musical loops that anyone can access and use without restriction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Combined with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17752">Myna</a>, Aviary's audio editor, Roc strengthens Aviary's position as a full fledged media creation platform. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10559">As always</a>,  Aviary allows users to share their works publicly under both our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial</a> licenses.</p>
