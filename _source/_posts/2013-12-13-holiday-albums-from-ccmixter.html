It's an amazing community for downloading and sharing CC-licensed, remixable music and samples.</p>
<p><a href="http://tunetrack.net/ccmixter/blog/posts/637/season-of-gratitude-holiday-albums/">ccMixter has released two albums of holiday music this year</a>; you can buy them or receive them for free for becoming a ccMixter supporter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prlog.org/12248205-cup-of-winter-cheer-ccmixters-season-of-gratitude-double-album-now-available-on-itunes.html">From the press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Season of Gratitude was first conceived last November, when the ccMixter all-volunteer admin team organized its annual Holiday Remix Event called Gift of Song. The community created original holiday-themed samples, a capellas, songs, and remixes. True to all ccMixter uploads, each original sound was released with Creative Commons licenses which inspire collective creativity and allow everyone to enjoy the resulting songs for free.  The Season of Gratitude double album is a curation of the remixes that transpired from the event, re-mastered by ccMixter artist Copperhead, for optimum sound quality.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>â€œI love participating in the annual holiday remix event on ccMixter,â€ shares Kara Square, contributing Season of Gratitude artist.  â€œThe atmosphere on the site is extra warm and open-minded.  As we contribute, we learn about each otherâ€™s beliefs and celebrate our diversity through the music we invent.â€</p></blockquote>
