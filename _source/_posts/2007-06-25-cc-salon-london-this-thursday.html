<p>Hello friends. A quick reminder that the <a href="http://www.ccsalon-london.org.uk/2007/05/18/welcome-to-cc-salon-london/">very first CC Salon London</a> will be taking place this Thursday, at <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/17/17289/Juno/Shoreditch">Juno</a>, Shoreditch High Street, London E1, from 6.30pm until midnight. There will be music from the <a href="http://after-dinner.net/">after-dinner.net</a> DJs as well as talks and presentations from Elizabeth Stark  (<a href="http://freeculture.org/">freeculture.org</a>), Tom Reynolds (<a href="http://randomreality.blogware.com/">Random Acts of Reality</a>)  and Jonathan Roberts (<a href="http://wiki.freemedvd.org/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMeDVD</a>).</p>
<p>These salons are a real great chance for like-minded folk to inspire and excite one another - a strong community is so important for a movement like CC and fostering it through events like these is essential. If you are in the area, don't miss out on such a great opportunity!</p>
