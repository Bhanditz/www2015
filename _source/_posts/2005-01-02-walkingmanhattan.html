<p>In the last <a href="http://newyorker.com">New Yorker</a> issue of 2004 (I'm doing some catch-up reading), Ben McGrath has <a href="http://newyorker.com/talk/content/?050103ta_talk_mcgrath" ?>a fun Talk of the Town piece</a> on Caleb Smith, a guy who <a href="http://www.newyorkcitywalk.com/index.html">walked every street</a> on the island of Manhattan over the last year and a half.</p>
<p>The end of the piece mentions Mike Epstein, of the excellent <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4184">Creative Commons-licensed</a> photography blog <a href="http://www.satanslaundromat.com/sl/">Satan's Laundromat</a>. Mike has taken up Smith's peripatetic legacy; he has "so far logged just two dozen miles, but he has plans for one-upmanship. He intends to do Roosevelt Island."</p>
