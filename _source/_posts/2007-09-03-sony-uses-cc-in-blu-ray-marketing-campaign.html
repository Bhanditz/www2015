<p>Sony Europe is <a href="http://www.blu-ray.sony-europe.com/info/index.php/archives/13">releasing</a> marketing assets for its Blu-ray Disc format under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license as an <a href="http://www.ukprwire.com/Detailed/Advertising_Marketing/Sony_Europe_ignites_conversations_on_Blu-ray_Disc_9538.shtml">integral part of its campaign</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œBy creating assets available exclusively online and licensing them under Creative Commons, we are encouraging increased interaction between Sony and our target audience,â€ says James Kennedy, General Manager for Communications Europe at Sony.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Leo Ryan, director at RMM explains the strategy behind the campaign, â€œPrevious work with Sony BRAVIA proves that amazing digital content can provoke online buzz around a campaign on its own. However, we believe that itâ€™s essential to use online PR and social media relations to amplify this buzz. Weâ€™re linking strong relationships with influential bloggers and social networks, with natural search optimisation campaigns to ignite debate, build buzz and drive visits to the websiteâ€. </p></blockquote>
<p>It's great to see that Sony and the marketing firms behind this campaign see that "viral" marketing needs to empower hosts for maximum impact.</p>
