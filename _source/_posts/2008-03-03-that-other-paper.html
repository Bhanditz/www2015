<p>We were recently turned onto <a href="http://thatotherpaper.com/">That Other Paper</a>, an Austin based online-publication that focuses on technology and culture with its feet firmly planted in the CC-community. Not only do they license all their works under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">BY-NC-ND license</a> but they also release <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/austins_only_paper">their library of professional photography</a> under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by0sa/3.0/us/">BY-SA license</a>. Similarly, <a href="http://fourkitchens.com/">Four Kitchen Studios</a>, the company that owns and operates TOP, is an open-source design, development, and consulting firm with virtually all of their client and internal work licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>. If that wasn't enough, they are co-organizing <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampAustin">BarCampAustin</a> this year.  Talk about "<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051">Free Culture cred</a>"!</p>
<p>In related news, this is a good time to point out that CC will be representing at this years <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSW Interactive festival</a>, with more details about when/where to come later in the week. We can't wait to get back to Austin after the awesome time we had their last year and are looking forward to a stellar CC/SXSW experience. </p>
