<p>We've just flipped the switch on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss">a discussion area</a> for public participation as part of our new project development process (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/images/discuss-full.gif">image</a>). We're using mailing lists to facilitate the discussion of new license options, our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international">International Commons</a> project, and metadata strategies.</p>
<p>We kicked off the new model today with development of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss#sampling">sampling license</a>, with discussion driven by <a href="http://www.negativland.com/"> Negativland</a>, masters of the cultural remix and veteran dwellers of the fault lines between law and art.  <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-sampling">Join the effort</a>.</p>
<p>We'll roll out several other lists in the coming weeks.</p>
