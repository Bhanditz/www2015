<p>A hearty congratulations and a huge thanks to the CC Ireland team on the launching of the new suite of Ireland CC licenses! Led by Dr. Darius Whelan and Dr. Louise Crowley, the CC Ireland team worked for a long time to perfect these licenses, and their diligence has paid off. Artists in Ireland can now use a localized version of the most current licenses instead of an older license suite.</p>
<p>You can check out the new licenses through our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">license chooser</a> and learn more about the CC Ireland team on their <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ireland">wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>Avid readers will have noticed that announcements about 3.0 launches are getting fewer and fewer. Ireland, as one of the long-standing in-progress ports, was one of only a handful of 3.0 ports remaining. We hope to announce the launch of the rest within the next few months, before the launch of the new 4.0 license suite. Comments and input on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">4.0 licenses</a> are very welcome!</p>
