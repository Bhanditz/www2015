still from <em><a href="http://chrisdenaro.com/movies/prototype11.mov">prototype11</a></em> by <a href="http://www.chrisdenaro.com/">Chris Denaro</a> | <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/au/">CC BY-NC-SA </a></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.metroarts.com.au/?page=14&amp;theMnth=08-10&amp;a=item199">Shift</a></em>, a new exhibition by CC-using Australian artist <a href="http://www.chrisdenaro.com/">Chris Denaro</a>, recently launched at Brisbane's <a href="http://www.metroarts.com.au/">Metro Arts</a>. From <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/197">ccAU</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.metroarts.com.au/?page=14&amp;theMnth=08-10&amp;a=item199">Shift</a>, which showcases the work of CC artist <a href="http://www.chrisdenaro.com/">Chris Denaro</a>, focuses on the theme of 'motion' and is the culmination of a 10 month residency in which Chris worked with found material and other local artists.</p>
<p>Those of you who made it to CCau's <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/australasiancommons">conference</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/australasiancommonssalon/">ccSalon</a> in June will no doubt remember Chris's animations, which were screened on the big screen and plasmas in the venue throughout the day. Chris draws on CC-licensed material (primarily Flickr photos) and uses programming, design and animation techniques to turn it into completely new works. For example, the works from his 'prototypes' project (which were showcased on the CC conference) use looping motion to turn the original photos into moving, morphing creatures that look like they stepped straight out of the Matrix. The animations in turn are licensed under CC, so that others can use and build upon them.</p>
<p><strong>But probably most importantly of all, Chris's work shows us how creative and original remixed art can be. It's the perfect antidote to the claim that remix is just 'rehashing' other people's work. No one could argue that Chris's works aren't completely unique, innovative and, most of all, beautiful.</strong></p></blockquote>
