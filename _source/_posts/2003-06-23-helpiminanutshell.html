In a newly posted interview on the Apple site, "<a href="http://www.apple.com/pro/words/oreilly/">O'Reilly in a Nutshell</a>," Tim O'Reilly discusses how his publishing company came to be, how it follows open source trends, and how it publishes <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/founderscopyright/oreilly">many titles</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/founderscopyright/">Creative Commons Founders' Copyright license</a>.</p>
<p>
We should note that the Founders' Copyright isn't just for big publishing houses. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/founderscopyright/inquiry">Anyone can apply for a license</a> to release their works after 14 (or 28) years.</p>
