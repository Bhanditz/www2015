<p>Last year, we demoed DiscoverEd along with <a href="http://opened.creativecommons.org/ODEPO">ODEPO</a> at the Open Education Conference in Logan, Utah. CTO Nathan Yergler explained its various features and some if its issues. Since then, it's been worked on extensively and some of its functionality has improved. We've even gone ahead and produced a <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/discovered-paper-17-july-2009.pdf">white paper</a>, which explains what DiscoverEd is, what it aims to do, and what you can do to help improve it.</p>
<p>With the production of this <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/discovered-paper-17-july-2009.pdf">white paper</a>, we would like to officially announce the launch of <a href="http://discovered.creativecommons.org/search/">DiscoverEd</a>. Entirely open source, <a href="http://discovered.creativecommons.org/search/">DiscoverEd</a> is an experimental project from ccLearn which attempts to provide scalable search and discovery for educational resources on the web. Metadata, including the license and subject information available, are exposed in the result set. </p>
<p>As noted above, DiscoverEd has been discussed at a few meetings already, so this launch is mainly to help spread the word and to spark additional conversation. If you are an educator or anyone else looking for educational resources, it is available for immediate use and we welcome your feedback.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/DiscoverEd_FAQ">DiscoverEd</a> is a <strong>prototype</strong> intended to explore how structured data may be used to enhance the search experience. We are by no means launching this as a definitive tool; in fact, we intend just the opposite. We are launching this so that others in the search and discovery space can contribute to this project. There are a number of <a href="http://code.creativecommons.org/issues/issue?status=-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7&@sort=-activity&@search_text=&@dispname=DiscoverEd&@filter=status,project&@group=priority&project=3&@columns=id,activity,title,creator,assignedto,status&@pagesize=50&@startwith=0">known issues</a> which we would love help on, especially since we think the community's input and work should go into shaping future versions of this tool. This tool is currently intended for educational resources, but there is no reason anyone can't take and adapt it for other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Where do the search results come from?</strong></p>
<p>Results come from institutional and third party repositories who have expended time and resources curating the metadata. These curators either create or aggregate educational resources and maintain information about them. If you're a producer or curator of educational resources and would like to be included in the search <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/contact">contact us</a>. If you're an educator, we want to hear from you.  What works for you?  What's broken?  What can be improved?</p>
