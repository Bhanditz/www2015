<p>San Francisco, CA, USA -- March 24, 2008</p>
<p>Creative Commons today announced the expansion of a documentation project to explain various facets of Creative Commons licensing. The initiative includes links and PDF downloads to information on critical CC specifications, recommendations, research studies and tutorials. Some of the topics covered include the CC+ and CC0 projects, a simple licensing how-to, and best practices for integrating Creative Commons licensing in websites. The documentation project also offers posters, flyers and other creative media such as the "Sharing Creative Works" comic book. These documents may be downloaded directly from the Creative Commons Documentation page (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/documentation" title="Documentation project">http://creativecommons.org/projects/documentation</a>) and are suitable for high quality printing and display.</p>
<p>Alex Roberts, Senior Designer at Creative Commons, explained the benefits of the documentation initiative. "We're always trying to make Creative Commons licenses easier to understand and use. From the beginning, CC has championed human-readable copyright licenses. Our documentation project works to extend this practice by offering short guides and explanations to a variety of CC topics." All of the documentation is released under a Creative Commons Attribution license for redistribution, reuse and remix.</p>
<p>In addition to the documents created by staff, Creative Commons called upon the larger community to help build a rich documentation portfolio. Jon Phillips, Community &amp; Business Development Manager at Creative Commons, said that user participation is crucial in the documentation process. "There are so many interesting projects using Creative Commons licenses. We need to be able to draw upon these innovative organizations and talented individuals to help define and share their best practices. We've provided the framework and source files for many of our documents to get this process rolling." Creative Commons also asked for help from the broad community of CC adopters and open content supporters to help translate the PDF documents into other languages.</p>

<p><strong>About Creative Commons</strong><br />
Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach. Creative Commons was built with and is sustained by the generous support of organizations including the Center for the Public Domain, the Omidyar Network, The Rockefeller Foundation, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, as well as members of the public.
