<p>Today's New York Times features an excellent story on musician and Brazil's Minister of Culture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilberto_Gil">Gilberto Gil</a> titled <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/arts/music/11roht.html?ex=1331355600&amp;en=671d035bb0923f9b&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">Gilberto Gil Hears the Future, Some Rights Reserved</a></em>, featuring quotes from Lawrence Lessig:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œLook at remixing on music sites, which has become a core of creativity on the Internet and produced a huge archive of legally usable music,â€ said Lawrence Lessig, the author of â€œFree Cultureâ€ and founder of Creative Commons. â€œThat has allowed a whole bunch of people to display themselves as artists and be picked up by record labels and Web sites, and all of that began because Gil got us to think about what kind of freedom was necessary for music.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>Gil will be <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/music/conference/panels_schedule/?action=show&amp;id=MP060142">interviewed Wednesday afternoon at SXSW</a> on a track for developing artists.
