<h2>More about University of Rosario</h2>
<p>One of the most prestigious universities of the country, which has formed illustrious scientists and political figures of the country. Founded in 1651 but concluded in 1653.</p>
<p>The Founder instituted as symbols the Rosary, from which its name is derived, and the Cross of Calatrava, and dictated the â€œConstitutionsâ€ as a legal framework which at present govern the organization Universidad del Rosario.  The â€œConstitutionsâ€ are based on those established for the College of Salamanca, formerly called the Irish Nobles and today Fonseca.</p>
<p>Guided by the constitutions, El Rosario, as is referred to by the students, is a private and autonomous institution not linked to any political or religious organization.  According to the Salmantino model it is governed by de Colegiales de Numero.  The Colegiales are fifteen active students of the highest academic standing and moral qualities and conduct, equivalent to the fellows of the English Colleges, who have as their main responsibility the election of the top authorities of the university and execute duties in the Cloister, particularly as Academic secretaries of the Faculties.</p>
<p>Different from other Colombian universities, El Rosario has never seen its academic activities interrupted.  This continuity, together with the fulfillment of goals set up by the founder, has definitely made it a leading player in the history of the country.</p>

Free and open content and tools are key. As a result of this interest, an independent group â€œDerecho, Internet y Sociedadâ€ (DIS) has been created. DIS will host, among other projects, the FoundationÂ´s activities related to the public promotion and legal support of Creative Commons under the coordination of <a href="http://www.karisma.org.co/carobotero/" target="_blank">Carolina Botero</a>.</span></p>
