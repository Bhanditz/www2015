<h2>More about the SCRIPT Centre for Research in  IP and Technology</h2>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Picture-2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-20779 alignright" title="Picture 2" src="img/Picture-2.png" alt="" width="279" height="90" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/">SCRIPT Centre for Research in  IP and Technology</a> was established at the  University of Edinburgh in 1998   as a centre of excellence in the  disciplines of intellectual property law (IP)   and information  technology law (IT). Initially the purpose was to bring together   and  provide a coherent focus for work that was on-going at the University of    Edinburgh, in particular within the School of Law, from which were  drawn the   four founding co-directors (Edwards, Laurie, McQueen and  Waelde). The Directors   found that studying and teaching IP and IT law,  and medical jurisprudence and   ethics, not in isolation but as  inter-related phenomena, and not just in their   legal but also their  social, ethical, cultural and commercial context, generated   innovative  cross-cutting research of the highest quality. As a result, SCRIPT  emerged as a   pioneer centre in the UK. It was on the basis of the  successes of SCRIPT that   AHRC funding was secured in 2002.</p>
<p>Its research is about the synergetic relationship between law,  technologies,   commerce and society in the widest possible sense. As  well as IT and IP, we and   our associates are concerned with the  adjunct areas of biotechnology, genetics   and medical jurisprudence and  ethics; law and artificial intelligence, including   the distribution  of legal knowledge via the Web; regulation of electronic   commerce, the  Internet, media, and the information society; it also consider law   as  it affects information management and cultural production and  archiving.</p>
