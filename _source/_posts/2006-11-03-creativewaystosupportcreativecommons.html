<p>Creative Commons has worked diligently to provide non-traditional ways for our community to support CC, and it's exciting when our community responds with their own creative ways as well. There is now a historical domain name - 01b.com - up for <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230046794467">auction</a> on <a href="http://ebay.com">eBay</a>. The owner will be donating 90 percent of all revenue to Creative Commons for our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support">annual fundraising campaign</a>. According to the description on the eBay site, 01b.com was one of the first RSS aggregators but was abandoned in April 2006. Here is a screenshot of the original page.</p>

<p>This domain name has a rating of PR5 and the owner would prefer the top bidder use it for serious reasons only. If you're interested in supporting Creative Commons by acquiring this domain name the item number is 2300467794467 and is found <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=230046794467">here</a>.</p>
