<p>The fourth season of the animated series <a href="http://www.oddjobjack.com/"><i>Odd Job Jack</i></a> (featuring stars like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004517/">Jason Alexander,</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000422/">John Goodman,</a><a> </a><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000225/">Christian Slater,</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662504/">Molly Parker,</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005467/">Jerry Stiller</a>)  began airing recently on Canada's <a href="http://www.thecomedynetwork.ca/">Comedy Network.</a> The show is a riot - each episode follows a temp worker through a different employment misadventure (i.e. mortuary worker, security guard, "rodent wrangler"). This week, we heard the supremely cool news that the show's creators are launching <a href="http://www.oddjobjack.com/freejack.php">Free Jack</a>, in which the master Flash files and bitmaps of every piece of art used in this season of the show are being released sunder the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license. Share, use, and remix the files to your heart's content!</p>
<blockquote><p>Why: We love animation and we just know you do too. We're proud of Odd Job Jack and we've put lots of work into our show. Our art deserves to live beyond broadcast and who better to give a free gift to than the entire planet?</p></blockquote>
