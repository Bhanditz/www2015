<p>While we've been testing out <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4507">CC Publisher</a> betas over the past few weeks, we've <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5193">recently gone 1.0</a> on the application and figured it was a good time to create <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tools/ccpublisher">an easy to follow tutorial for using CC Publisher</a>. We've also <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tools/cclookup">created one for CC Lookup</a>, our audio file verification app. In addition to both new tutorials, we've also added one that highlights new Creative Commons aware features that were added to the Windows P2P application Morpheus. If you'd like to share your Creative Commons licensed music on their P2P network in a way that others can find it, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/publish-morpheus">follow our instructions</a>.</p>
