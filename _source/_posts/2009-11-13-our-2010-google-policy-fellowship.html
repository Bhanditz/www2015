<p>Weâ€™re very excited to announce that Creative Commons will once again be part of <a href="http://www.google.com/policyfellowship">Googleâ€™s Policy Fellowship</a> for the summer of 2010, and we're looking forward to filling the big shoes of our 2009 policy fellow, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/fellows#206">Aurelia Schultz</a>.Â  Just like last year, the Google Policy Fellow will receive a substantial grant to work at Creative Commons' San Francisco Office on the following issues (but this is certainly not an exhaustive list of the things weâ€™ll have you thinking about):</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Synthesize statistics garnered from recent studies focusing on international license adoption. Fellow will be expected to generate and investigate diverse theses relating to license choice, adoption, and use.</li>
<li>Coordinate with counsel to critically analyze the current state of public domain policy in US and abroad. Develop a framework to help Creative Commons' deploy messaging regarding public domain policy in US and abroad.</li>
<li>Research and analysis of how the contemporary discourse of copyright, sharing, reuse, and remix has been shaped over the last six years as a result of the Creative Commons project.</li>
<li>Investigate new opportunities for Creative Commons implementation in 'uncontacted' communities, institutions, artists, and mediums.</li>
<li>Work with Creative Commons' international community and jurisdiction project leads on projects, research, and outreach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.google.com/policyfellowship/hosts.html#creativecommons">more details</a> and <a href="http://services.google.com/inquiry/policyfellowship">the application</a>, which is due by <del datetime="2009-12-16T23:07:58+00:00">December 28th, 2009</del>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Google has extended the application deadline to January 25th, 2010, allowing you an extra month to get your <a href="http://services.google.com/inquiry/policyfellowship">application</a> together!</p>
