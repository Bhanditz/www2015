<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">From <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/ch/">CC Switzerland</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>The organization <a href="http://www.openlaw.ch">Openlaw</a>, platform for law and Free Software, has filled the role of Legal Lead for Creative Commons Switzerland for several years. The tasks entailed, among others, the adaptation of Creative Commons in Switzerland and providing a point-of-contact for inquiries about the licenses.</p>
<p>Creative Commons in Switzerland will now be coordinated by <a href="http://www.allmend.ch">Digitale Allmend</a>, while Openlaw will be stepping down from its role at Legal Lead.</p>
<p>Personnel will be set along the following lines: Martin Feuz (Community); Philippe Perreaux (Legal Consultation); Simon Schlauri (Development of the CC Licenses)</p>
<p>Creative Commons Switzerland will be supported through Dr. Urs Gasser, Attorney, Professor at the University of St. Gallen. Within the framework of an extended support network, previous CC CH members Urs Gehrig, lic.iur (Basel) and Dr. Christian Laux, Attorney LLM (ZÃ¼rich) will be readily available.</p></blockquote>
