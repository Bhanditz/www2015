<p><a href="http://P2P-Politics.org">P2P-Politics.org</a> lets friends and colleagues share political videos with just a click, thanks to Creative Commons copyright licensing</p>
<p><span class="caps">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, CA, <span class="caps">USA  </span>â€”October 17, 2004â€”A new people-to-people website, <a href="http://P2P-Politics.org">P2P-Politics.org</a>,<br />
today announced a free service for sharing political expression online.<br />
The site enables anyone to select from a menu of video clips the ones<br />
that best express their view of the U.S. presidential elections, and<br />
then email links to those clips, along with a personalized message, to<br />
friends, family, and colleagues. Like a cross between an online<br />
greeting-card service and a gallery of campaign advertisements, <a href="http://P2P-Politics.org">P2P-Politics.org</a> makes everyday people broadcasters of political expression from across the spectrum.</p>
<p>The site launched today with 150 clips from <a href="http://MoveOn.org">http://MoveOn.org</a>â€™s<br />
â€œBush-in-30-Secondsâ€ contest. Because all entries to that contest are<br />
under Creative Commons â€œsome rights reservedâ€ copyright licenses, their<br />
reuse on <a href="http://P2P-Politics.org">P2P-Politics.org</a> did not require the cumbersome process of rights-clearance.</p>
<p>The<br />
site invites anyone to upload their own video clip, and it has invited<br />
the Bush, Kerry, and Nader campaigns to contribute content to be<br />
shared. So far, only the Kerry campaign has responded favorably to the<br />
invitation, but organizers are optimistic that the other campaigns will<br />
participate as well.</p>
<p>â€œPolitical ads have one purpose,â€ said<br />
Lawrence Lessig, chairman of Creative Commons. â€œThat is to elect the<br />
candidate they support. With just over two weeks to go, we expect the<br />
campaigns will be eager to help their supporters get the message out.â€ </p>
<p>The<br />
ads are hosted by the Internet Archive, which hosts and serves files of<br />
any size at no chargeâ€”provided they are under Creative Commons<br />
licenses. <span class="caps">P2P</span>-Politics will curate content<br />
to assure its appropriateness, and no content will be posted without<br />
the authority of its copyright owner.</p>
<p>The site was built by<br />
volunteers responding to a weblog post earlier this month. It was<br />
designed by J Christopher Garcia and Aaron Swartz. It will be supported<br />
through the election; afterwards, all content will remain at the<br />
Internet Archive.</p>

<p><strong>About the Internet Archive</strong></p>
<p>The<br />

build an â€œInternet library,â€ with the purpose of offering permanent<br />
access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical<br />
collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located<br />
in the Presidio of San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data<br />
donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the<br />
organization started to grow to build more well rounded collections,<br />
like its Open Source Music and Open Source Movies catalogs.</p>
