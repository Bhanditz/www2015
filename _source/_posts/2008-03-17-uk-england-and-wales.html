<h2>More about Information Systems and Innovation Group (ISIG) - Department of Management</h2>
<h2><a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/informationSystems/"><img src="img/lse-logo.jpg" alt="" width="106" height="106" align="right" /></a></h2>
<p>The Information Systems and Innovation Group has joined with other departments to form a new Department of Management in 2006. This is enabling us to develop and expand all our current areas of teaching and research and has opened up new areas for joint work.</p>
<p>We continue to research and teach in a wide range of IS topics and to develop our approach of the social study of information and communication technologies. We are engaged in a wide range of research in topics ranging from the experiences of individuals as they use information technology, to the management of large organisational systems, and national and worldwide policies, trends and standards.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 2006 to integrate management-related units at theLSE, the Department of Management has won praise for its uniquely sophisticated degree programmes that combine the study of management with the SchoolÃ­s renowned social sciences perspective. Our courses are designed to serve a diverse international student body and global corporate recruiters.</p>
