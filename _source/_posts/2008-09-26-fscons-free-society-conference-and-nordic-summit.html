<p>Free Culture, Free Software, and Free Content will join forces under the banner of "Free Society" at FSCONS on October 24-26 at the IT University of GÃ¶theborg, Sweden. The <a href="http://fscons.org/organisers/">orgnaizing trinity</a>, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.se/">Creative Commons Sweden</a>, <a href="http://fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>, and <a href="http://se.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Sverige</a>, see FSCONS as a chance to reach out with their respective communities and build joint projects with like-minded activists and organizations.</p>
<p>A strong speakers lineup provides the rhetorical food-for-thought in the Free Culture track. Mike Linksvayer (<a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>) asks, "How far is free culture behind free software?" as he charts key indicators and historical factors in the progress of each. <a href="http://www.abm.uu.se/evahw/">Eva Hemmungs Wirten</a> argues that the digital commons extends back to nineteenth-century London, while <a href="http://swartz.typepad.com/">Oscar Swartz</a> keynotes the <a href="http://fscons.org/events/">events</a> with the warning that Sweden's controversial "Lex Orwell" may usher in "The End of Free Communication".</p>
<p>Nikolaj Hald Nielsen spotlights <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok 2</a>, the intuitive music player for Linux and Unix, demonstrating a viable intersection of Free Culture and Free Software. Meanwhile, other landscapes are being analyzed by Inga Walling (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>), who recounts the project's efforts to create and provide free geographic data.</p>
<p>John Buckman (<a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>) riffs on "Squeezing the Evil out of the Music Industry" by using CC licensing to rethink record labels. And since online attribution persists as a thorny issues for many music content sites, Victor Stone (<a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a>) reports on how some platforms are solving the problem with the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/viewfile/pool_api_doc">Sample Pool API</a>.</p>
<p>The blend of timely topics and kindred communities makes FSCONS an exciting event to follow this autumn. Thanks a lot to the organizing teams for their efforts -- we're looking forward to this!</p>
