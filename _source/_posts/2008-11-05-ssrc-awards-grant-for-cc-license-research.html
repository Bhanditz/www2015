<p>We're thrilled to announce that the <a href="http://mediaresearchhub.ssrc.org/news/ssrc-announces-seven-new-grants-winners-small-grants-and-research-bounties">Social Science Research Center (SSRC) has awarded CC with a grant for the project Assessing the Commons: Social Metrics for the New Media Landscape</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the SSRC, George Cheliotis of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/sg/">CC Singapore</a> and the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> and CC will be researching the "global patterns of CC license use, as well as developing metrics showing penetration and impact of open licensing, per jurisdiction and globally." Developing a solid metrics system for CC license use is vital to sustaining CC and to the growth of the Commons. By knowing how and where our licenses are used, Creative Commons can develop more effective tools, which is important to all parts of the open movement.</p>
