<p>University of Barcelona is spearheading the effort to translate Creative Commons licenses into Spanish and Catalan.</p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, USA and Barcelona, Spain</strong> - Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative works free for copying and re-use, announced today that formal work has begun for expanding its International Commons (iCommons) project to the Iberian peninsula, with both Spanish and Catalan translations in the works.</p>
<p>The University of Barcelona will lead the effort.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be working with the University of Barcelona," said Lawrence Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford. "With its rich heritage and linguistic reach, Spain can serve as a model for many countries in expanding the global cultural commons. And we're excited to begin work on Catalan versions of the licenses in parallel."</p>
<p>"We think that Creative Commons' project is very interesting and therefore we have decided to promote it from a public institution as the University of Barcelona," said Ignasi Labastida i Juan, project lead of the iCommons efforts in Spain and Catalonia. Ignasi Labastida i Juan added, "Since the project of the licenses appeared, we thought that we needed adaptations for our own laws and in our languages. The idea to create iCommons Catalonia was very important to us since we are not well known but we speak the seventh language in the EU in terms of number of speakers - more than ten million."</p>
<p>First announced in March 2003, iCommons is Creative Commons' project to make its machine-readable copyright licenses useful worldwide. As the lead institution, University of Barcelona will coordinate a public effort literally and legally to translate the Creative Commons licenses. University of Barcelona will field comments on an archived email discussion at the Creative Commons website:</p>

<p>Spain and Catalonia join Brazil, Croatia, Italy, Ireland, Finland, Japan, China, Taiwan, France, and the UK in the iCommons effort. Several other iCommons jurisdictions and languages will soon follow.</p>
