<p>Early this week, SpaceShipOne became the first manned private flight into space. The event was <a href="http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/SS1_touchdown_040621.html">covered by industry news organizations</a> as well as the general media, but personally, I find <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/33838#690584">this first-person account</a> and <a href="http://www.damer.com/pictures/events/04-06-SpaceShipOne/index.html">these sets of photos and movies of the launch</a> more compelling than the general news coverage so far.</p>
