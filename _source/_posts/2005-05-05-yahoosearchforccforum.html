<p>Yahoo! has added a <a href="http://messages.search.yahoo.com/ccommons/forumview?bn=ccommons">forum</a> to support <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/cc">Yahoo! Search for Creative Commons</a>.  If you have questions or feedback for Yahoo! concerning this service, now you have a place to ask.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5356">this post</a> introducing Yahoo! Search for Creative Commons.</p>
<p>Today Yahoo! also <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000106.html">took their video search out of beta</a>.  You can't (yet -- hint, hint!) explicitly search for CC licensed videos, though you will find some -- Yahoo! Video Search has indexed the Internet Archive's <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/movies">Moving Images Archive</a> and other respositories with CC-licensed content. You can license and upload your videos for free using <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tools/ccpublisher">ccPublisher</a>.</p>
