<p><img src="img/omf_logo.png" alt="omf_logo" title="omf_logo" width="250" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />Deproduction, a Denver-based video production company, and Civic Pixel, an open-source web development group, have joined forces to become the <strong><a href="http://www.openmediafoundation.org/">Open Media Foundation</a></strong>. The two groups were previously affiliated through <a href="http://www.denveropenmedia.org/">Denver Open Media</a> where they taught local communities media production tools, producing unique and engaging content in the process.</p>
<p>The Open Media Foundation picks up where these two groups left off, focusing upon <a href="http://www.openmediafoundation.org/services">services</a> (video production, website creation, and graphic packages), <a href="http://">education</a>, and <a href="http://www.openmediafoundation.org/community-tools">accessible tools</a>. One of OMF's most engaging aspects is the scalability of their mission. Nearly all of the content they produce is either CC-licensed or open-source, allowing it to be adopted easily and legally elsewhere. In January, <a href="http://www.accessf.org/">Access San Francisco</a> will become the 8th station to adopt the open source tools OMF developed as part of the <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/winners/2008">Knight NewsChallenge</a>. Similarly, through support from the Google <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> program, the OMF made major improvements to CC support in Drupal. </p>
