<p>On Wednesday, June 18 Creative Commons will hold its first technology summit in Silicon Valley at Google's Mountain View campus.  Over the past five years we have actively developed and contributed to technologies that complement our licenses, with the aim of using software to enhance the discoverability and practical [re]usability of content -- to help users manage content, as opposed to software designed to help content manage users (i.e., DRM). </p>
<p>The summit is intended to bring together many parties interested in making sure "Copyright 2.0" facilitates rather than hinders innovation and the open web. The summit will include an update and overview of Creative Commons technologies, panels featuring other leaders in open digital rights technologies, and a look at the future, including the role of digital copyright registries.  You can find out more about the program and schedule on <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18">the wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>There is no cost to attend, but space is quite limited.  If you'd like to attend, please <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/~nathan/techsummit/">register here</a>.</p>
