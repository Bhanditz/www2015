<p>Mike Meyers, star of the popular <em>Austin Powers</em> series, has just scored <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=598&e=16&u=/nm/20030214/film_nm/film_myers_dc">an unusual movie deal with Dreamworks</a> that will allow him to make films from sampling earlier movies. DreamWorks will acquire the necessary rights so the actor can be digitally inserted in the old flicks.</p>
<p>Today, people practicing in music and movie "<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/01/bootlegs/print.html">mash-ups</a>" are usually operating in a muddy area of legality (or they do it <a href="http://www.illegal-art.org/">illegally</a>). How cool would it be if those of us without the backing of Dreamworks' lawyers could do this sort of thing? Or, as we say in <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/">our demo movie</a>, "Shouldn't it be easier still?"</p>
