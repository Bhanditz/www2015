<p>Caught an interesting <a href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/riversimple-an-open-source-fuel-cell-vehicle/"><em>NY Times</em> post</a> over the weekend about <a href="http://www.riversimple.com/">Riversimple</a>, a British start-up that recently debuted a prototype of a two-seat hydrogen fuel cell car. There are several interesting things about Riversimple's proposed business model - for instance, it plans to lease the car instead of sell it, and wants to employ a manufacturing process in which the cars are built in a variety of small, local factories. The detail that is of particular interest to us here at Creative Commons, though, is that the company has published the car's design schematics under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC Attribution-Noncommercial license</a> on the site of the <a href="http://www.40fires.org/">40 Fires Foundation</a>, a project that invites community participation in the car design process.</p>
<p>Says Riversimple CEO Hugo Spowers:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œIf we give away the tools for entrepreneurs around the world to make money from making cars, we expect to harness an unstoppable groundswell of support globally.â€ â€¦ â€œFrom a strictly commercial point of view, we want to encourage others to copy us as we want these standards adopted ubiquitously.â€</p></blockquote>
