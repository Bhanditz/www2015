<p>We've <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/features/musicians">previously featured</a> Scott Andrew, a <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/main/music">musician</a> and <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/">blogger</a>, talking about his Creative Commons licensed songs.<br />
<a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/main/000450">Last year</a>, he noticed a song by <a href="http://www.shannoncampbell.info/">Shannon Campbell</a> that he liked, which he began adding to, rearranging, and remxing. He emailed it to her, she liked it, and <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/mp3/misc/dreaming_of_violets.mp3">he posted it</a> on his site (this was done before the Creative Commons started so he obtained permission before sharing the song).</p>
<p>Today Scott and Shannon are participating in a 24-hour charity event called <a href="http://www.blogathon.org/">Blogathon</a>. The event asks weblog authors to pick a charity and post something regularly over a 24 hour period this weekend, while sponsors pledge money to the charity. Past blogathons have raised over $50,000 annually for hundreds of charities.</p>
<p>For their "<a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/blogathon/">Pet Rock Star^s</a>" blogathon site, they're accepting donations for <a href="http://www.mhopus.org">Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation</a>, but they are planning to do something a little bit different with their blog. They've decided to collaborate on a new song, going from idea to finished product over the 24 hour period, posting every lyric idea, guitar riff, and communication between the two (Scott's on the west coast, Shannon's on the east coast &mdash; oh, and they've never met in person).</p>
<p>
The coolest part? Every song chunk: the chorus, the drums, the guitar strums, will all be <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/blogathon/#713">posted and released under a Creative Commons license</a>, so you can play along too, adding your vocals, drums, or lyrics to create new versions. They're already off and running, and it looks great so far.</p>
