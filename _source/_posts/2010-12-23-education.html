<p>Since 2007, Creative Commons has maintained an ccLearn is striving to realize the full potential of the internet to support open learning and open educational resources, and to minimize legal, technical, and social barriers to sharing and reuse of educational materials</p>
<p>[intro video]<br />
Open Educational Resources<br />
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses">Creative Commons licenses</a> provide a globally-recognized framework for open educational resources (OER) &amp; learning materials that are freely available to use, remix, and redistribute. CC licenses enable teachers, learners, and educational institutions to share the legal rights to use, remix, and redistribute textbooks, lesson plans, video lectures, and more.</p>
<p>OER are a response to the barriers in education that currently exist. How often are the resources you need behind a paywall or under "all rights reserved" copyright? Do you ever wish a resource was available in another language or format, or to improve outdated or incorrect information? Have you ever tried combining resources together to create a new resource - only to find that you can't because the different resources don't interoperate (work together legally)? How much time do you spend finding the resources you actually need?</p>
<p>CC licenses and other legal tools address and largely overcome the legal and technical restrictions that prevent educational resources from being accessible, adaptable, interoperable, and discoverable. Below are examples of people and projects that are using CC to enable greater sharing and innovation in education.</p>
<p>[i updated the text in the examples from /education, but we may need to switch out/eliminate some examples for redesign. specifically, we want the examples to represent overcoming the barriers (accessibility, adaptability, interoperability, discoverability) as much as possible. also the visual format will prob be different?]</p>
