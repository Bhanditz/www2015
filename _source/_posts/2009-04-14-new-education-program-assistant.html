<p>Welcome to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#114">Alex Kozak</a>, our new Education Program Assistant! Alex will be graduating from the University of California, Berkeley next month, with a BA in Philosophy. (That makes three former Philosophy majors at ccLearn.) </p>
<p>In this economy, it was no surprise that we had access to a great pool of highly-qualified candidates. Thanks to everyone who submitted an application, especially to those who were patient during the interview process. We were inspired by the number of committed persons in and outside of open education, and we are positive that all of them will move on to effectively fill positions relevant to their interests. </p>
<p>Please <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/communicate">be in touch</a> for future opportunities and news about the movement in general. </p>
