<p>If I hadn't interned for Clarity Films one summer, I would never have learned most of what I know now about the apartheid, Nelson Mandela, and Desmond Tutu. I spent hours transcribing interviews and condensing documentary footage into some type of digital package that I don't recall the name of (nor do I remember the outdated technology I used). What I do remember: the world's reactions to the tumult that surrounded South Africa within the past fifty some odd years. </p>
<p><a href="http://iheritage.wordpress.com/open-sa/"><img src="img/opensa-logo.jpg" alt="opensa-logo" width="240" height="240" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12580" /></a>Now, anyone can learn about South Africa and its rich heritage with the recent launch of <a href="http://iheritage.wordpress.com/open-sa/">OpenSA</a>, "a pilot project to make South African heritage more accessible for remixing and re-publishing by online creators." From the announcement at <a href="http://www.africancommons.org/2009/01/sharing-our-heritage-online-with-opensa/">The African Commons Project</a>:</p>
<p>"In collaboration with SA Rocks and the African Commons Project, OpenSA! is collecting, tagging and managing donations from people who are willing to make their material freely available online. OpenSA! will also be helping to coordinate outreach to South Africaâ€™s young creators to enable them to learn more about how to find open content that they are free to remix and share.</p>
<p>As access to the Internet grows in South Africa, so too does the range of creative activity by a new generation of active online citizens. Internet publishing in the form of blogging and citizen journalism, online publishing of photographic, video and music publishing are all part of a wide range of democratic speech that we as a young nation are trying to encourage and nurture."</p>
<p>Some media they've found and posted so far:<br />
