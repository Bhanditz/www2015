<p><img align="left" style="margin-right: 7px" src="img/318710331_c50d206e83_m.jpg" />This weeks' winner of the Creative Commons first ever CC Swag Photo Contest is "andyket". The fifth winning photograph titled <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreas/318710331/in/pool-ccswagcontest06/">"The CC Glow"</a> shows an innovative use of our informational disk flyers.</p>
<p>We are again amazed by the<a title="entries and participation" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ccswagcontest06/"> entries and participation</a> and thank all of you very much. There is one week left so we ask that you keep up the good work and keep shooting and supporting CC.  Next weeks' winner will be the last before we decide on the 2 overall winners. So if you want your image and name to be used as CC promotional material for the next year have your image uploaded to CC's Flickr group <a title="CCswagcontest" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ccswagcontest06/">CCswagcontest</a> by Monday Dec. 18th. Good Luck!</p>
