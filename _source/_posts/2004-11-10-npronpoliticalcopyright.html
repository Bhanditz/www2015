<p>Today, NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=4162541">Morning Edition covered the difficulty in getting public domain speeches by politicans</a> earlier today. Even though a speech is likely in the public domain, recordings by TV Networks retain copyright. It's a sticky point Creative Commons Chairman and co-founder Lawrence Lessig also argued  <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.08/view.html?pg=5">in a WIRED article</a> a few months ago.
