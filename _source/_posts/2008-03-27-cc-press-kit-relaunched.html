<p>We are pleased to announce a brand new <a href="/presskit">Press Kit page</a>. Based on user requests and feedback, we have completely redesigned it to make it easier for you to find and use specific CC graphics.</p>
<p>As before, all graphics are available in various formats for any purpose, including large format transparent PNGs &mdash; which work well in presentations. The page also features direct links to vector versions of our icons and license buttons, and are recommended for use in videos and printed works. </p>
<p>Please read our <a href="/policies">policies page</a> for information on how our logos may be used, and see our <a href="/projects/Marking">marking project</a> for examples and best practices on marking your work.</p>
