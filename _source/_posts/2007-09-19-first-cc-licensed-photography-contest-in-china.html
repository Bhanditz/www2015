<p align="left"><a href="http://cn.creativecommons.org/en/">CC in China Mainland</a> has partnered with the online photo-sharing community <a href="http://www.nphoto.net/">nphoto.net</a> and one of Chinaâ€™s largest internet portals, <a href="http://www.sohu.com/">sohu.com</a>, to co-sponsor the <a href="http://cc.nphoto.net/">first CC-licensed photography contest</a> in China Mainland. The first submissions were received on September 1st, 2007, and at the time of this posting, entries now number around 3,500 and span three major categories: society &amp; humanity, nature &amp; landscape, and portrait.</p>
<p>The contest is open to both professional and amateur photographers, and as the blog from CC in China Mainland <a href="http://cn.creativecommons.org/en/index.php/2007/09/19/first-cc-licensed-photography-contest-in-china/">reports</a>, all entrants will select a localized CC license for their photos.</p>
<p>Judging will be carried out in two phases, the first consisting of open, online voting ending October 15, followed by a selection by a panel of experts. Awards will be presented to the winners on November 3rd at the <a href="http://www.nlc.gov.cn/old/english.htm">National Library of China</a> accompanying the opening of a critically-acclaimed photography exhibition.</p>
