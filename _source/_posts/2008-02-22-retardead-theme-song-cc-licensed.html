<p><a href="http://www.4321films.com/retardead/index.html">Go here now</a> to listen to the wonderfully absurd theme song to <em><a href="http://www.4321films.com/retardead/index.html">RetarDEAD</a></em>, a soon-to-be released low budget indie monster film (mp3 located near page bottom). The theme song is released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">BY-NC license</a>, allowing for remixing pleasure. Via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/22/retardead-indie-horr.html">BoingBoing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Evil has come to the Butte County Institute of Special Education, and its students will never be the same. Armed with a fatal hyper-intelligence serum, the mad Dr. Stern single-handedly transforms a quiet community into an army of flesh-eating zombies. It's a showdown of limb-chopping, head-bursting proportions as Stern's nemesis, F.B.I. agent Susan Hannigan, and the local sheriff's department take on the zombie plague in the ultimate battle royale. In short, it's sort of like "Flowers for Algernon" meets "Night of the Living Dead."</p>
<p>Jello Biafra, former lead singer of the Dead Kennedy's plays the town's mayor. I also sing the theme song duet with Girl Trouble lead singer Kurt "KP" Kendall - and as a backup singer in the "Retardettes." The song has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial License, so it is free and available for remixing.</p></blockquote>
