<p><a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/">ETC Press</a> has just launched as an "academic, open source, multimedia, publishing imprint." The project is affiliated with the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon University and is in partnership with <a href="http://www.lulu.com">Lulu.com</a>.  When authors submit their work to ETC they retain ownership of it but they also must submit it under either an Attribution-NoDerivativeWorks-NonCommercial or an Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. </p>
<p>ETC press then posts the works to Lulu.com where they are available for purchase in its hardcopy form, or free download.  While the project focuses specifically on writing about entertainment technology, it is easy to see ETC's model scaling to publishers of other topics and genres. </p>
<p>Check out ETC's <a href="http://www.etc.cmu.edu/etcpress/?q=book">current titles to download or buy here</a>.</p>
