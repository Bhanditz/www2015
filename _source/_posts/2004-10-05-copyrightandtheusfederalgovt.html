While I watch the news in Portland about <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/volcanocams/msh/">Mt. St. Helens</a> and its possible upcoming eruption, I'm seeing plenty of <a href="http://technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fs.fed.us%2Fgpnf%2Fvolcanocams%2Fmsh%2F">links to the volcano webcam</a> on blogs. One of the blogs that stood out for different reasons is the Berkeley Intellectual Property blog's <a href="http://www.boalt.org/biplog/archive/000610.html">post about the Terms of Service, copyright status, and law around Federal work entering the public domain</a>. In the end, the author can't prove that the webcam images are in the public domain, but draws the conclusion they likely should.</p>
