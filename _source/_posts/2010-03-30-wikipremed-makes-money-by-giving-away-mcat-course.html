<p>Artists have been using Creative Commons licenses in interesting ways for a while, whether it's to encourage <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18970">interesting adaptations</a> of their work or to help <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12695">boost album sales</a>. But it's not only the visual artists and musicians diversifying the use of CC licenses---open education initiatives like Flat World Knowledge are <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20805">experimenting with innovative business models</a> by giving away digital content while charging for services added around it. <a href="http://www.wikipremed.com/">WikiPremed</a> is another one. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikipremed.com/">WikiPremed</a> is the result of fifteen years of hard work, founded by John Wetzel, a graduate of Stanford University who has been helping "premedical students prepare for the MCAT in small group teaching through over fifty course cycles." The site is comprehensive in scope, basically a course "in the undergraduate level general sciences," consisting of textbooks, flash cards, test questions, images, and more that a premed student would need to prepare for the MCAT. All materials are available for free under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike</a>, which means you can translate, improve, and republish it as long as you share alike. </p>
<p>What's more interesting is that the site is sustaining itself by giving away digital content for free and charging for print materials, such as its Physics flashcards and print versions of its books. There is also an ask for a one-time $25 donation that then gives students an Organic Mechanisms Pocketbook and Advanced Physiology Crosssword Puzzle Book in return as a thank you. From Glyn Moody's <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2010/03/wikipremed-making-money-from-free.html">short interview</a> of John Wetzel (which got picked up by <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20100315/1053108567.shtml">techdirt</a>),</p>
<blockquote><p>"Students need printed study materials, and they get sick of the computer, so I definitely think there is room for creative commons educational content supported by print publications. I think there is an ethic to not holding content hostage to purchases, but I think there are commercial advantages to the open model as well. I don't doubt that the average customer at WikiPremed has 1000 page views before purchasing anything.</p>
<p>I am sure that if there were registration walls and missing chapters I would have fewer customers. </p>
<p>I'm not getting rich or anything, at this point, but it is working."</p></blockquote>
