<p>Last month, a few folks in the world of weblogs asked some good, hard questions about Creative Commons licensing of their works.  (We covered that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/archive/2003/02/#3601">discussion here</a>). At the time, Denise Howell put <a href="http://bgbg.blogspot.com/2003_02_02_bgbg_archive.html#90282671">a request</a> out to other lawyers to weigh in on the issue, and recently, attorney Tim Hadley did so.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.tph-lex.com/archives/weekly/week_2003_02_23.html#000113">Tim's exhaustive analysis</a> examines the ins and outs of applying a license to a weblog (specifically in the context of Movable Type's recent support for Creative Commons licenses).  He takes a long look, in particular, at the issue of  <a href="http://blog.tph-lex.com/archives/weekly/week_2003_02_23.html#removing">license revocation</a> and echoes our <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/cat_creative_commons.shtml">chairman's take</a> on the subject not long ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.tph-lex.com/archives/weekly/week_2003_02_23.html#000116">Tim has also posted a follow-up</a> based on feedback and posts from other sites and is planning a complete revision of his first post on the subject -- the goal being to cover as many sides of the issue as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks, Tim -- and to the rest of you sparking discussion about the licenses.</p>
