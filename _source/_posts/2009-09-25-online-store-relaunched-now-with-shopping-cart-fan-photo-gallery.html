<p>If you have not yet stocked up on any of our cool CC swag, now is the time to do so! We've relaunched our <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/store">online store</a>, now with shopping cart capabilities so you can order as many stickers, T-shirts, lapel pins, and buttons as you wish! All T-shirt sizes are fully restocked as well.</p>
<p>And, since CC would be nowhere without the valuable support and positive energy of our friends and fans, <strong>we want to feature YOU on our store site</strong>. Send as many pictures as you like of your CC swag (on you, your friends, your pets, in nature - get creative!) to store[at]creativecommons.org as an attachment or URL, and be featured in our online photo galleries. Check out the shining faces of <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/node/51">these very well-dressed CC fans</a>. </p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/store">online store</a> today and pick up some swag for you or your friends. Not only will you be supporting CC, but you'll be able to spread the word about us to all you meet!</p>
