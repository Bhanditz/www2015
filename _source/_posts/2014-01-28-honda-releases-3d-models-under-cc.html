<p>This morning, auto manufacturer Honda <a href="http://world.honda.com/news/2014/41401283D-Data-Concept-Models/index.html">released 3D data for the exterior designs of several of its concept models</a> under a <a href="/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC)</a> license. <a href="http://world.honda.com/news/2014/41401283D-Data-Concept-Models/index.html">From the press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the data downloaded from the website "<a href="http://www.honda-3d.com/">Honda 3D Design Archives</a>," Honda's concept models can easily be replicated by a household 3D printer, which is becoming more popular in recent years. By offering data of its concept models, which embody the spirit of "Honda Design," Honda offers opportunity to enjoy a simulated experience of Honda's "art of manufacturing."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can view the designs on <a href="http://www.honda-3d.com/">the new Honda 3D site</a> or download them in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL</a>. Since the designs are licensed under BY-NC, anyone can share, modify, and remix them noncommercially. Now that these designs are in the wild, it will be cool to see who mods them in unexpected and creative ways.</p>
