<p>The keen eye of Professor <a href="http://k.lenz.name/LB/">Karl-Friedrich Lenz</a> found <a href="http://k.lenz.name/LB/archives/000345.html">what appears to be a discrepancy</a> between the warranty provision of Creative Commons' licenses and our own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/policies">policies</a> page, which reads in part: </p>
<p><em>
<p>This website provides general information about legal topics but it does not provide individual legal advice. Creative Commons Corporation is not a law firm and does not provide legal services. Using this website or sending us email does not create an attorney-client relationship.  <b>Creative Commons provides this information on an 'as-is' basis. Creative Commons makes no warranties regarding the information provided on this website, and disclaims liability for damages resulting from its use.</b></p>
<p></em></p>
<p>Lenz is right that this language is unduly confusing.  We meant this language <b>not</b> to exempt Creative Commons from the copyright warranties in the license that governs our site. Rather, this disclaiming language was meant to apply back to the sentences immediately preceding it -- the text warning that we do not provide legal advice -- and not to copyright status of information on the site, generally. New language on our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/policies">policies</a> page makes this distinction clearer:</p>
<p><em>
<p>This website provides general information about legal topics but it does not provide individual legal advice. Creative Commons Corporation is not a law firm and does not provide legal services. Using this website or sending us email does not create an attorney-client relationship. Creative Commons provides <b>this general legal information</b> on an 'as-is' basis. Creative Commons makes no warranties regarding <b>the general legal information</b> provided on this website, and disclaims liability for damages resulting from its use.</p>
<p></em></p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>(1) Yes, our copyright licenses' warranty provision applies to Creative Commons, just as it does anyone else using our licenses.</p>
<p>(2) The disclaimer on our policies page is intended to refer only to the "general legal information" provided on our site, and now more clearly does so.  (Thanks to Prof. Lenz.)</p>
<p>(3) It's worth noting that the licenses' copyright warranty, on the one hand, and our disclaimer regarding general legal information, on the other, serve the same goal: to remind every licensor that the decision to use or not to use a license is a serious matter, and ultimately a decision for the licensor alone.</p>
<p>(4) As I said in my <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3687">last post</a>, we're reconsidering the warranty issue. Until we take a decision, the warranties apply. To us, too.</p>
