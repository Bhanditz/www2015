<p>The open educational resources movement has been picking up steam lately, even attracting the attention of legislators. What's hot in the new Persian year (aka the start of spring) is the recently introduced "<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1464">OER Bill</a>". What's that, you say?</p>
<p>Well in its own words, it's a bill "To require Federal agencies to collaborate in the development of freely-available open source educational materials in college-level physics, chemistry, and math, and for other purposes."</p>
<p>Like <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/807">David Wiley</a>, we also don't quite <em>trust our eyes</em>. (<em>Italics</em> don't really do it justice either.)</p>
<p>Read further, and you'll see that the bill requires all federal agencies expending more than  $10,000,000 a year on scientific education and outreach to "use at least 2 percent of such funds for the collaboration on the development and implementation of open source materials as an educational outreach effort in accordance with subsection."</p>
<p>The bill also complains a great deal about the cost of closed (versus open) textbooks. This is an undeniable fact that might finally get recognized by Congress. <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1464">Read the full bill now</a>.</p>
