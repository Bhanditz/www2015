<p><img src="img/cc10_mixtape_300.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="right" />One of the opportunities for Creative Commons to continue its rapid evolution is more collaboration between the various affiliates. In September, representatives of CCâ€™s <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network">affiliates</a> in 17 different European countries attended a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34706">regional meeting</a> and discussed, among other things, <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons' 10th birthday</a>. Most of the affiliates were already planning activities and events in their own countries; nevertheless, we felt that it was important to find a way to celebrate this important date as a regional network. Since the majority of the affiliates are volunteers, we cannot commit ourselves to carry out as many common actions as we would like. With other priorities in both the national and regional agendas, this activity could not require much planning and execution. The idea of creating a mixtape with Creative Commons&#8211;licensed music from around Europe - where each affiliate just had to suggest one or two tracks from her own country - seemed, therefore, a good option and got the general agreement of all those present at the meeting.</p>
<p>Back to our home countries, we relied on the network mailing list to get everyone involved. We did not nominate an official project lead and we did not establish any requirements other than the music being the affiliate's preferred CC-licensed music. We could have decided to use the mixtape to promote just music licensed with one of CC's free culture licenses (<a href="/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> and <a href="/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>), but we wanted to get as many affiliates involved as possible and we knew that adding such limitation would only make searching for work more difficult. After all, only a very few of us work in the music industry (the others are lawyers, open content advisors, entrepreneurs, academic researchers, engineers, etc.) and not all of us are familiar with our national CC-licensed music.</p>
<p>Some affiliates went on asking for suggestions to their local communities and some even did contests to find their national CC-licensed music that would make into the compilation. Not all the European affiliates were able to get involved in the project, but those involved were really motivated and even found time to send contributions in respect to other European countries. In total, 16 affiliates worked together, devoting much more time than they initially thought they had available, to make this mixtape happen.</p>
<p>The resulting mixtape showcases the talent of 20 artists from 20 European countries: Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The tracks are from genres as diverse as electronic, folk, classic, drum & bass, rock, ska and tango, and they sound awesome together (despite the fact that they were compiled by a non-musician lawyer!).
