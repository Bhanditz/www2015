<p>Today, Creative Commons is excited to make two important announcements.</p>
<p>First, we're thrilled about a major new grant of $4 million from the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/">William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>, consisting of $2.5 million to provide general support to Creative Commons over five years, as well as $1.5 million to support <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/">ccLearn</a>.</p>
<p>We're also pleased to announce some changes to CC's leadership that reflect. <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a> is stepping down as CEO of Creative Commons, to focus on his newly-launched project, <a href="http://change-congress.org/">Change Congress</a>. He will be replaced by entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and free culture advocate <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a>. Lessig will remain on the Creative Commons board.</p>
<p>From Larry:</p>
<blockquote><p>â€œBoth pieces of news we are announcing today reflect Creative Commonsâ€™ maturation from a startup into crucial infrastructure for creativity, education, and research in the digital age.â€</p></blockquote>
<p>Founding board member and Duke law professor <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/boylesite/">James Boyle</a> will become chair of the board, replacing Ito, who will remain on the board.</p>
