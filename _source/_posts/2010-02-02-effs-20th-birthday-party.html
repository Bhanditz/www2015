<p>For the past 20 years, our friends at the <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> have been at the forefront of the intersection between technology and law, helping to define and fight for our rights in the digital age. We'd like to congratulate them on hitting the 20 year mark. To celebrate their 20th birthday, they're <a href="https://www.eff.org/calendar/2010/02/10/effs-20th-birthday-with-adam-savage">throwing on a party this February 10th in San Francisco</a>:</p>
<p>February 10, 2010<br />
Doors open at 8 pm, VIP event at 7 pm<br />
$30 donation (no one turned away)<br />
DNA Lounge<br />
375 Eleventh Street<br />
San Francisco, CA</p>
<p>Special VIP donors are invited to a pre-party event with Adam Savage, John Perry Barlow, John Gilmore, Mitch Kapor, Mark Klein, and others. </p>
<p>They've also created a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/02/effs-20th-birthday-commemorative-poster">commemorative poster</a>, which is available in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hughelectronic/4325854994/">hi-res</a> under CC BY:</p>
