<p>From our excellent post at the <a href="http://www.botmag.com/articles/maker_faire_2006_photoessay.shtml">Robotics Pavilion</a>, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/creativecommons/sets/72157600251308496/">Creative Commons team</a> could watch visitors participate in the huge array of activities, crafts, and <a href="countless interactive stations">inventions</a> featured at last weekend's <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/10/make_faire_photos_and_more.html">Maker Faire</a> in San Mateo.  Faire goers wandered the grounds between countless interactive stations to enjoy <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laughingsquid/507248038/">flame throwers</a>, <a href="http://www.makezine.com/faire/program/presentations/">educational presentations</a>, <a href="http://www.makezine.com/faire/program/presentations/">sewing</a>, <a href="http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/140">silk screening</a>, and the popular <a href="http://news.com.com/2300-1026_3-6185218-13.html">robot battles</a>.  We were very pleased to be involved in the exhibit this year, and would like to thank the event coordinators and sponsors who made it possible!</p>
