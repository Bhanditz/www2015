<p>It's no secret that <a href="http://flickr">Flickr</a> has a great <a href="http://flickr.com/creativecommons">archive of Creative Commons-licensed photos</a> -- over <em>50 million</em> as I write this.  Last week I ran across a plugin for <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> that makes finding and using these images even easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.photodropper.com/">Photo Dropper</a> allows you to search for images, optionally filtering for whether or not photos allow commercial use, and insert them into your blog post along with the appropriate photo credit.  Their site has <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photo-dropper-screenshots/">screenshots</a> and <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/wordpress-plugin/">installation instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Great job, guys!</p>
