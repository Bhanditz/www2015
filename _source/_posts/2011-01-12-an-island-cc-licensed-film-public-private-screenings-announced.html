<p>Music and film lovers take note - <em><a href="http://anisland.cc/home/">An Island</a></em>, a beautiful new film by <a href="http://www.vincentmoon.com/">Vincent Moon</a> featuring Danish band <a href="http://www.efterklang.net/">Efterklang</a>, is very quickly nearing public release. A <a href="http://vimeo.com/18622678">new teaser</a> for the film was released today along with an announcement describing the <a href="http://anisland.cc/home/host-a-screening/">"Private-Public Screenings" of the film</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Efterklang and Vincent Moon welcome all our listeners and followers to host their own screenings of An Island.</p>
<p>We call these screenings Private-Public Screenings and the rules are very simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>The screenings need to have free entrance</li>
<li>The screenings need to be public.</li>
<li>The screenings need to have a minimum capacity of 5 people</li>
<li>The screenings need to be verified by Efterklang & Vincent Moon and only screenings that are featured on www.anisland.cc are official Private-Public Screenings</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Moon and Efterkland hope to create "a free and inspiring distribution method for [the] film" - as such, <em>An Island</em> is CC BY-NC-SA licensed (like all of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/21398">Moon's current work</a>), allowing the free sharing and reuse of the film for non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p>More info on hosting your own screening is <a href="http://anisland.cc/home/host-a-screening/">available here</a>.</p>
