<p><a href="http://bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/ripmixburn">RIP.MIX.BURN.BAM.PFA</a>, an art exhibit that celebrates "the cultural and artistic practice of remix", opens this Friday at the <a href="http://bampfa.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive</a> (BAM/PFA). From BAM/PFA:</p>
<blockquote><p>
RIP.MIX.BURN.BAM.PFA [...] invit[es] guest artists to â€œrip, mix, and burnâ€ elements from two digital-media works in the museumâ€™s collectionâ€”Ken Goldbergâ€™s Ouija 2000 and ValÃ©ry Grancherâ€™s 24h00 (both 1999)â€”resulting in new artistic creations. Drawing from the open-source software tradition, with the permission of artists Goldberg and Grancher, the remix artists may alter or revise original code or media files from the source works, or they may choose to take a more conceptual route, remixing some of the methods or behaviors of the originals into their own new works.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are co-hosting the opening of RIP.MIX.BURN.BAM.PFA, and as such there will be plenty of CC schwag and "free beer" come this Friday. The exhibit looks to be quite the happening, so make sure to check it out if you are interested! </p>
