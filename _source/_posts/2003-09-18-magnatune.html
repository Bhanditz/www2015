<a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> is an amazing new record label that is completely rethinking old music industry business models. They offer music from a wide range of genres that you can download, stream, and listen to. And, like computer shareware, <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/ethos">you buy stuff you like only after trying it out first</a>. The label <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/model">splits profits with artists 50-50</a> and even offers a sliding scale for purchases through Paypal.</p>
<p>
On top of all that, they've released <a href="http://magnatune.com/info/openmusic">every song on the label under a Creative Commons license</a>. Like their slogan says, "We are not evil." Sounds like an understatement.</p>
