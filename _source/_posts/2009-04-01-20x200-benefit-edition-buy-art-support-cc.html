On Tuesday, April 7th, <a href="http://www.20x200.com">20x200</a>, a project started by <a href="http://www.personism.com/jen-bekman-bio/">Jen Bekman</a> that produces affordable, exhibition quality art prints and sells them exclusively online, will release a special benefit edition by designer <a href="http://magicalnihilism.wordpress.com/">Matt Jones</a> with proceeds to benefit Creative Commons. This is an incredible way to support CC, so be sure to <a href="http://www.20x200.com/mailinglist">sign up</a> for the twice-weekly 20x200 newsletter to to be among the first to collect Matt's print for as little as $20.  Popular editions often sell out via the mailing list before they're even available on the 20x200 homepage, so add yourself to the list for your best shot at getting one of Matt's prints and supporting CC in this unique way.</p>
<p>We are honored that Matt Jones has chosen CC as the beneficiary for his special 20x200 edition, and as always, we are extremely grateful for the generous support of our community!
