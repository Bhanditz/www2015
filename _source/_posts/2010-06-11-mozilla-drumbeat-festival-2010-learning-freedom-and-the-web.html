<p>Mozilla has announced the first ever Drumbeat Festival focused on learning, freedom, and the web. Mozilla wants you to save the dates November 4-5, as the festival is set to take place in Barcelona---also where the <a href="http://openedconference.org/2010/">Open Ed Conference</a> will be taking place from November 2-4. From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Learning, freedom and the web are connected. This connection has huge potential. The technology and culture of the internet offer the raw material to put people in control of their own learning in a massive and transformative way. At the same time, teachers and learners can play a critical role in ensuring that these raw materials -- and the internet as a whole -- remain open and free.</p>
<p>This is the focus of Mozilla's first annual Drumbeat Festival: gathering passionate and practical people who are experimenting, inventing, creating, exploring and building things at the intersection of learning, freedom and the web.</p>
<p>Drumbeat Festival 2010 will showcase people, ideas and projects with huge potential. Things like:</p>
<p>1. A secure 'data backpack' where students control their own learning materials and credentials<br />
2. Libraries transformed into digital garages where kids learn to make, do and create with an agile, hacker attitude<br />
3. Massively scaled apprenticeship, we people learn by diving into the world of open source master craftspeople<br />
4. Hackerspaces where people teach each other about everything from robots to lasers to knitting<br />
5. Alternative accreditation models based on web and open source peer review techniques</p>
<p>The idea is to gather people working on ideas like this -- and people with all the puzzle pieces needed to make them real at a massive scale.</p></blockquote>
<p>Creative Commons, along with the MacArthur Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, is partnering with Mozilla to make this event possible.
