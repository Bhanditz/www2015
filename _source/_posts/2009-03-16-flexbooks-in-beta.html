<p>Today marks the beginning of the second half of the month, and with it, the Ides of March are safely behind us. What else is behind us: the beta launches of several Flexbooks, aka the <a href="http://www.ck12.org/">CK-12 Foundation</a>'s version of open source textbooks. </p>
<p><a href="http://flexbooks.ck12.org/flexr/"><img alt="" src="img/logo_flexbooks.gif" class="alignnone" width="90" height="26" /></a></p>
<p>The most notable Flexbook is the one we mentioned <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9378">last fall</a>---notable because of its integral tie to state standards via a partnership with the Commonwealth of Virginia. The textbook now has a title, <em><a href="http://flexbooks.ck12.org/flexr/workbench/?searchTerm=cwv&amp;mode=search&amp;autoSearch=1">21st Century Physics FlexBook: A Compilation of Contemporary and Emerging Technologies</a></em>. According to <a href="http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/03/04/Flexbook-beta.aspx?Page=1">Government Computer News</a>, the effort was statewide, "a collaborative effort by the state departments of Technology and Education and volunteer educators, engineers and scientists using Web-based tools to quickly up-date educational resources" to "provide students with timely information about nanoscience, dark matter, quarks and leptons." This only makes sense as Physics (and science in general) is a rapidly changing field that the traditional textbook review process cannot keep up with. Open textbooks, on the other hand, are instantly editable and constantly changing; you could even say that they are perpetually in beta.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to check <a href="http://flexbooks.ck12.org/flexr/workbench/?searchTerm=cwv&amp;mode=search&amp;autoSearch=1">it</a> out, along with the myriad other Flexbooks up for review. All Flexbooks are licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA</a>.</p>
<p>What's ahead of CK-12: the progression of existing Flexbooks and the partnerships they have with other states, where some are working on companion teacher editions. </p>
<p>Also, spring!</p>
