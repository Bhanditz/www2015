<p>The Silicon Valley nonprofit announces new file-sharing-friendly music<br />
license alongside its new Get Content search engine.</p>
<p>Austin, Texas, USA - March 18, 2004 - Creative Commons, a nonprofit<br />
dedicated to expanding the range of creative works free to share and<br />
build upon, announced its new Music Sharing License and Get Content<br />
search engine at the South by Southwest Music Festival here today. </p>
<p>The license, which is available free of charge from the Creative Commons<br />
website, allows musicians to clearly mark their songs as free to download<br />
and share while protecting their commercial and other rights. The license<br />
also helps musicians tag their works digitally, which allows Creative<br />
Commons' Get Content search engine to index them from the web site. </p>
<p> This is the music-sharing notice bands can use to invite their fans to<br />
 download and share their music noncommercially.</p>
<p>"Finally, musicians who want to share and fans who want legal downloads<br />
can find each other easily and quickly," said Neeru Paharia, Assistant<br />
Director of Creative Commons. "The Net already makes widespread<br />
distribution very easy - technically. The Music Sharing license, in<br />
combination with the new Get Content search engine, lets musicians<br />
harness the Net's distributive power while protecting themselves -<br />
legally."  </p>
<p>Matthew King Kaufman, founder of Beserkley Records and MP34U.com, said:<br />
"If there's going to be legal p2p, then a Creative Commons Music Sharing<br />
license is a mandatory prerequisite."</p>
<p>Like all Creative Commons tools, the Music-Sharing License uses a<br />
three-layer interface to put fans on notice of the music's legal status.<br />
First is the Commons Deed, a plain-language summary of the legal<br />
language's key terms. Next is the Legal Code, the full copyright license<br />
in all its nitty-gritty detail (identical to the legal code for the<br />
Attribution-Noncommercial-NoDerivativeWorks license). Third is Creative<br />
Commons' metadata, a machine-readable expression of the license, so that<br />
users can search for and sort sharing-friendly music with the Get Content<br />
search engine, which indexes web pages carrying Creative Commons' license<br />
tags and metadata. The search engine is the first that allows users to<br />
find content based on the permissions and restrictions associated with<br />
it.</p>
