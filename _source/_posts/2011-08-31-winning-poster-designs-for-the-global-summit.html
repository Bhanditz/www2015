<p>The <a href="http://www.loftwork.com/blog/pickup/ccsummit2011-poster/?lang=en_US">Creative Commons Global Summit Poster Competition</a>Â has been a huge success, with 38 entries from around the world!</p>
<p>We thank each and every one of you who submitted a design and participated in the voting process. Three winning designs wereÂ chosen based on popular vote and by a panel of judges from our CC Poland team (with a little help from other international affiliates).</p>
<p>The popular vote winner was:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our Polish judges came up with a tie - so we decided to award two judges prizes:</p>

<p>Each poster will be printed and featured prominently at the lovely <a title="Primate's Palace" href="http://www.palacprymasowski.pl/the_primates_palace" target="_blank">Primates Palace</a>Â in Warsaw for ourÂ <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011">Global Summit</a>, to be held from September 16-18. The posters will also be displayed as part of a digital CC visual arts exhibit at the venue.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the designers, and thanks to all of you who participated!</p>
