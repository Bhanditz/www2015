<p>In April we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5861">belatedly</a> blogged license adoption estimates for December 2005, which had been published elsewhere in December.  That estimate, based on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5693">Google queries</a> restricted to CC-licensed content, came to 45 million web pages under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>What a difference six months make.  Our current aggregate estimate, also based on Google queries for CC content, comes to 140 million pages. Impressive, though it must be noted that this much higher number is probably the result of both increasing use of CC licenses and overall growth of Google's index.</p>
<p>In April we also gave a current breakdown of license use by license property.  Here is an updated breakdown:</p>
<div align="center" class="thumb tright">
<div style="width: 402px"><a title="Distribution of licenses deployed. Those without 'by' (attribution) were not versioned past 1.0 (excepting public domain, which is not versioned)." class="internal" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Image:Licenses-pie-20060613.png"><img width="400" height="311" border="0" longdesc="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Image:Licenses-pie-20060613.png" alt="Distribution of licenses deployed. Those<br />
without 'by' (attribution) were not versioned past 1.0 (excepting public domain, which is not versioned)." src="img/400px-Licenses-pie-20060613.png" /></a></p>
<div class="thumbcaption">
<div style="float: right" class="magnify"><a title="Enlarge" class="internal" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Image:Licenses-pie-20060613.png"><img width="15" height="11" border="0" alt="Enlarge" src="img/magnify-clip.png" /></a></div>
<p><small>Distribution of licenses deployed. Those without 'by' (attribution) were not <a title="License versions" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/License_versions">versioned</a> past 1.0 (excepting public domain, which is not versioned).</small></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The increased use of more liberal licenses noted in April seems to have<br />
accelerated, though again it must be noted that some of the change may<br />
be due to search index variability (Yahoo!'s in this case, as Yahoo!<br />
facilitates searching for specific license URLs with <code>link:</code> queries).</p>
<div align="center">
<table>
<tr>
<th>License Property</th>
<th>February 2005</th>
<th>April<br />
2006</th>
<th>June 2006</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>NonCommercial</th>
<td>74%</td>
<td>71%</td>
<td>68%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>NoDerivs</th>
<td>33%</td>
<td>28%</td>
<td>24%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>ShareAlike</th>
<td>49%</td>
<td>48%</td>
<td>45%</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Look for another update in December, hopefully with some indications of<br />
adoption across jurisdictions and languages (again with many caveats).</p>
