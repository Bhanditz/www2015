<p>Last week, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> posted a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/11/23/how-to-make-55000-by-giving-away-your-work/">fascinating article</a> on the profits made by Nina Paley for her film <em><a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/">Sita Sings The Blues</a></em>. Widely <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Sita_Sings_the_Blues">available</a> <a href="http://www.legaltorrents.com/torrents/386-sita-sings-the-blues---480p-sd">for</a> <a href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/wiki/index.php?title=SitaSites">free</a> online under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike</a> license, <em>Sita</em> has garnered $55,000 to date, an impressive amount for a film that has spent nothing on promotion or adverting.</p>
<p>While this amount only conveys part of the story - the article leaves out the cost to make the film as well as Paley's cost-of-living - it is inspiring to see such fiscal success from a work of open-cinema. Aurelia Schultz, current CC legal research volunteer, <a href="http://www.ipswhatsup.com/2009/11/nina-paleys-numbers-cc-licensing-for.html">digs deeper</a> with the numbers on her blog, making the following observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>A better tally of how [Paley] has done would include how the Sita copyright issue and subsequent CC licensing have increased Ninaâ€™s income from her other works by increasing her visibility; how much she makes from speaking engagements (which she say are her most lucrative work); and how much more she would have paid out under her settlement agreement had she released the film in a more traditional manner.  Since all of these things only add to what she has already made, itâ€™s clear that releasing Sita under a Creative Commons license was a good choice for Nina.</p></blockquote>
