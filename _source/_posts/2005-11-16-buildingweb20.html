<p>It is my duty as a member of the Xtech 2006 <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/08/18-xtech2006/read">program committee</a> to inform you of the <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2005/11/15-xtech/read">call for participation</a>.  The theme of the conference, to be held May 16-19 in Amsterdam, is "Building Web 2.0."</p>
<p>Whatever you think of the Web 2.0 name, it is clear that Creative Commons is highly relevant, as remix of various forms (e.g., of content and web services) is core to the phenomena, with an attendant need for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5676">interoperability</a> and flexible copyright licensing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xtech-conference.org/2005/schedule.asp">Xtech 2005</a> featured presentations from Creative Commons and Science Commons.  I hope to hear about projects <em>using</em> Creative Commons at Xtech 2006.</p>
<p>Check out the simultaneously expansive and 100% on point <a href="http://www.xtech-conference.org/2006/call.asp">Xtech 2006 CFP</a> now. Proposals are due 2006-01-09.</p>
