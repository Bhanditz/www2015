<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/militiamix">The Fine Art of Sampling Contest</a> has drawn to a close and we're fortunate enough to have great judges picking the winners. For the Freestyle Mix, <a href="http://wiredmag.com">WIRED</a> music editors and contributors Eric Steuer, Philip Sherburne, Adrienne Day, Hua Hsu, and Geeta Dayal will be making the final call.  For the Militia Mix, Brian Hardgroove of the Fine Arts Militia, Scott Egbert of GigAmerica, and their associates will be making the final pick.  </p>

If you're interested in hearing the submissions (of which many are amazing) they're all available <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/freestylemix/entries">here</a>, and <a href="http://ccmixter.org/contests/militiamix/entries">here</a>. We'd like to thank all of the entrants and judges for participating in this experiment of free culture. </p>
