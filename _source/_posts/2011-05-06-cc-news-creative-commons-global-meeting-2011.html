<p><strong>Creative Commons Global Meeting 2011</strong></p>
<p>Since the last global meeting of the Creative Commons community in Sapporo, we&rsquo;ve seen the launch of CC0 and the Public Domain Mark, and a half-dozen more CC affiliate jurisdictions with many more in the works. To celebrate this and many other CC milestones, we are holding our next global meeting on the 16-18th of September this year in Warsaw, Poland. Co-hosted by our CC Poland team led by Alek Tarkowski, the event will bring together affiliates from more than 70 jurisdictions, CC staff, and a number of CC Board members. In addition to gathering requirements for version 4.0 of the CC license suite, the meeting will consist of workshops and forums on CC community building and adoption efforts in key sectors such as education, public sector information, and data.

<p><strong>CC Attribution required in government policy</strong></p>
<p>We are excited to announce that Creative Commons has been awarded a grant from The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to provide support to successful applicants of the U.S. government's Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) grant program. All grantee outputs will be released under the CC Attribution (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1105&utm_medium=blog&utm_source=newsletter">CC BY</a>) license. To assist grantees, Creative Commons, along with several partnering organizations, will provide expertise in open licensing, adoption and use, and more. Our technical services will offer a competitive advantage for organizations seeking TAACCCT grant funds and ensure that the open educational resources created with these federal funds are of the highest quality.

<p><strong>More exciting developments in government and foundation policy</strong></p>
<p>In addition to requiring <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1105&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">CC BY</a> for TAACCCT grantee outputs, the U.S. Department of Labor has also <a href="http://t.co/Z4Lgd9i">required</a> CC BY for outputs of the Career Pathways Innovation Fund. The fund makes available up to $122 million to &quot;continue DOL&rsquo;s support for community colleges, with a particular focus on career pathway programs implemented by community colleges in partnership with other organizations in the community.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1105&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">CC BY</a> is also the chosen license for non-software outputs of the Next Generation Learning Challenges grantees, a multi-year program dedicated to improving college readiness and completion in the United States.
