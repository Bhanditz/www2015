<p>Chuck Severance, clinical professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information, recently published a new textbook in 11 days because he was able to remix an existing textbook. The book, <a href="http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php"><em>Python for Informatics: Exploring Information</em></a>, is currently being used in his winter semester Networked Computing course. The textbook is based on the openly licensed bookÂ <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html" target="_new"><em>Think Python: How to Think like a Computer Scientist</em></a> byÂ Allen B. Downey. Students are able to take advantage of the University Library'sÂ <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/espresso-book-machine">Espresso Book Machine</a> to print on-demand copies for approximately $10.Â <em>Python for Informatics</em> is available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> license.</p>
<p>Severance explains, "the book is a cool example of a situation where I've finally got to the 'remixing' bit of the Open promise." The first 10 chapters are done and eight more are planned for completion by April 2010. Read more ofÂ <a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/000679.html">Chuck's thoughts</a> about remixing an open book.</p>
<p>Creating this open textbook was a part of a larger effort by Chuck toÂ support his course with openly licensed Â content, and current versions of lecture slides and videos are publishedÂ via theÂ <a href="http://www.pythonlearn.com/">PythonLearn</a> website. Â In a past iteration of the course, Chuck went through the <a href="https://open.umich.edu/wiki/DScribe">dScribe process</a> developed by <a href="http://open.umich.edu">Open.Michigan</a> to create an <a href="https://open.umich.edu/education/si/si502-winter2009">OER version of SI 502</a>, available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a> license.</p>
