<p>Creative Commons' Russian affiliate <a href="http://www.iis.ru/">Institute of the Information Society</a> (IIS), in collaboration with the <a href="http://iite.unesco.org/">UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies</a>, organized an international seminar and expert meeting on the 6th of December in Moscow. As the CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#jonasoberg">Regional Project Manager</a> for Europe, I participated in the event together with representatives from Creative Commons in <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>The seminar was attended by industry participants, organizations and representatives from Russian governments and federal agencies, including the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications, Ministry of Education and Science, Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications, Federal Antimonopoly Service, State Duma of the Russian Federation, Research Center of Private Law at the President of the RF and the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>IIS legal experts have prepared an analytical report, <a href="http://creativecommons.ru/sites/creativecommons.ru/files/docs/ispolzovanie_ss_v_rf.pdf">Use of Creative Commons Licenses in the Russian Federation</a> (pdf), which was presented at the seminar. It contains conclusions and recommendations for future activities aimed at introducing Creative Commons in Russia, including discussion of potential legislative changes aimed at enabling the licence locally. It also contains an annex with information and results from the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011">CC Global Summit 2011</a> in Warsaw in September 2011.</p>
<p>Other sessions at the seminar included presentations by representatives of each of the CC jurisdiction teams present, as well as critiques of the CC licences by local academics and the local Wikimedia chapter, with much of the discussion focusing on 4.0. The day finished with a special UNESCO-hosted session on OER.</p>
<p>For Creative Commons, the seminar was an excellent starting point for our future work in Russia, and the participation of Creative Commons affiliates from the CIS countries shows that there is a clear interest in working together in the regions. As part of its work, IIS will now start providing input to the recently launched <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0">Version 4.0 process</a>, as well as continuing its work to raise awareness of Creative Commons with Russian authorities.</p>
<p>It's very exciting to see this region grow; I'm very happy to see that there's now a discussion around the upcoming Version 4.0, its relevance for Russia and the possibility for Russia to participate in the shaping of this important license suite for sharing culture globally!</p>
