<p>It is time to celebrate and spread the dream that everyone in the world can access a high quality, affordable education if we collectively share our educational resources and spend our public resources wisely!</p>
<p>The second annual <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/">Open Education Week</a> will take place March 11-15, 2013 (see <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/events-webinars/">schedule</a>).  Open Education Week is a five-day celebration of the global Open Education movement, featuring online and local events around the world, video showcases of open education projects, and lots of information. The week is designed to raise awareness of both the movement and its impact on teaching and learning worldwide. </p>
<p>Open Education refers to the growing set of practices that promote the sharing high quality, openly licensed educational resources (<a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education-program/open-educational-resources">OER</a>) and support for learners to access education anywhere, anytime. Open Education incorporates educational networks, open teaching and learning materials, open textbooks, open data, open scholarship, and open-source educational tools.</p>

In addition, the <a href="http://schoolofopen.org/">School of Open</a> will officially launch its first set of courses next week, including courses on copyright and Creative Commons for educators.
