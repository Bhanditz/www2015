<p>Here is a cool <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> find. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/phyredesign/">Jordyn Meredith</a> , an art student in Baltimore, has licensed her digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrology">dendrology</a> collection under a CC Attribution, Share-Alike license.  These are absolutely gorgeous digital microscope shots of tree cross-sections. My favorite is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/phyredesign/198020180/in/set-72157594268450016/">Lilac Chastetree</a>.</p>
<p>From her description:</p>
<p>"After identifying the type of tree to which the branch belongs, I use a digital camera attachment on my microscope to photograph the samples. Piecing together over fifty photographs for each sample, each final image is a 100x magnification of a glimpse of life not seen by the human eye alone.  They become abstract structures reminiscent of any number of things."</p>
