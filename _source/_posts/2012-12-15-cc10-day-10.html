<p>Ten years ago today, the first Creative Commons licenses were released. Over the past ten days, <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">the CC community has celebrated around the world</a> with concerts, discussions, hackathons, and parties. People in the community have <a href="/weblog/entry/35903">put together mixtapes</a>, <a href="/weblog/entry/35929">created iPhone apps</a>, and blogged about why CC is important to them. <a href="/weblog/entry/35906">And then this happened</a>.</p>
<p>We've seen three major announcements: <a href="/weblog/entry/35879">Hatsune Miku becoming CC licensed</a>, <a href="/weblog/entry/35710">a huge grant for open education for adult English language learners</a>, and <a href="/weblog/entry/35812">Wikimedia Commons reaching 15 million files</a>.</p>
<p>We've had friends of CC blog about their favorite CC-licensed works: <a href="/weblog/entry/35440">Cory Doctorow on one of his biggest influences</a>, <a href="/weblog/entry/35542">John Wilbanks on an important public domain dataset from an unlikely source</a>, <a href="/weblog/entry/35531">Jason Sigal on a musician who built a career on open licenses</a>, and <a href="/weblog/entry/35538">Gautam John on a CC-licensed children's book that took on a life of its own</a>.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="/weblog/entry/35884">we talk with Jonathan Worth about the future of open education</a>, and <a href="/weblog/entry/35886">Claudio from Bad Panda Records shares his favorite CC-licensed songs</a>. And we leave you with a <a href="http://co.creativecommons.org/2012/12/05/guia-de-bolsillo-creative-commons/">pocket guide for the road</a>, courtesy of CC Colombia.</p>
<p>The past ten days have been a testament to the depth and diversity of the Creative Commons community. CC's greatest strengths are the depth and diversity of material in the commons, and the multitude of the commoners themselves. If you get excited about what this community can do together, then consider <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=2012fund&utm_source=blog3&utm_medium=blog">making a donation to CC today</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
