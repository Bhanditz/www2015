<p>Three new employees have joined Creative Commons in the last few weeks. Join us in welcoming Jenny Utke, Paul Stacey, and Puneet Kishor to the team.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="/staff#jennyutke"><span style="float:left;padding:10px;"><img src="img/jennyutke.jpg" width="100" height="100/" /></span><strong>Jenny Utke, Senior Accountant</strong></a></p>
<p>Jenny is originally from Michigan but has lived in California for over 10 years.  She started her career as an auditor at CPA firms in the Bay area, but has spent the remainder at various corporate industries doing general ledger accounting.  She has a bachelorâ€™s degree in Accounting from <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/">Grand Valley State University</a>.  Her hobbies include collecting arcade games, playing video games, hanging with friends, reading Stephen King, and watching TV.</p>

<p><a href="/staff#paulstacey"><span style="float:left;padding:10px;"><img src="img/paulstacey.jpg" width="100" height="100/" /></span><strong>Paul Stacey, Senior Project Manager</strong></a></p>
<p>Paul is responsible for project planning and implementation of initiatives across Creative Commons ensuring alignment with organizational strategy, consistency of process across projects, and customer satisfaction with the results.</p>
<p>Paul&#8217;s entire career has revolved around innovative use of technology for adult education. Starting in the late 1990&#8217;s and going to present time, Paul&#8217;s work has been in the public higher education sector. From 1999 through 2003, Paul helped plan and launch a new online technical university in British Columbia. In late 2003, Paul joined <a href="http://www.bccampus.ca/">BCcampus</a> as the Director of Development supporting development of open educational resources across all postsecondary fields of study.</p>

<p><a href="/staff#puneetkishor"><span style="float:left;padding:10px;"><img src="img/puneetkishor.jpg" width="100" height="100/" /></span><strong>Puneet Kishor, Project Coordinator for Science and Data</strong></a></p>
<p>Puneet likes to write programs that manipulate, analyze and visualize information from large datasets, but he worries what would happen to those data and results 50 or 100 years from now. He is unable to read the two decades old original digital version of his <a href="http://search.library.wisconsin.edu/catalog/ocm23045260">M.S. thesis</a> even while he can read R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a and Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata written a few thousand years ago. This, in part, motivates his passion for permanently free and open access to scientific data.</p>
<p>Puneet's main focus at Creative Commons is on science data policy. His extra-curricular engagements include <a href="http://earth-base.org">developing tools and techniques for management and analysis of earth sciences data</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and research at the National Academies/CODATA on <a href="http://www.codata.org/taskgroups/TGdatacitation/index.html">policy issues related to citation and licensing mechanisms for digital scientific information</a>. Any spare cycles are devoted to jazz and beer, preferably concurrently.</p>
