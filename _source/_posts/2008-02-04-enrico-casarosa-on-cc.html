<p><a href="http://enricocasarosa.com/">Enrico Casarosa</a>, a story artist at <a href="http://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a> and creator of "<a href="http://sketchcrawl.com/">SketchCrawl</a>," recently <a href="http://enricocasarosa.com/wordpress.1/2008/01/28/creative-commons/">posted</a> some thoughts about Creative Commons on his personal blog, capping his entry with the statement "Why not share ideas?". Casarosa's SketchCrawl encourages artists and non-artists alike to draw/paint/sketch continuously for an entire day, simply for the purpose of pushing one's creative boundaries and love of drawing.</p>
<p>As more people are made aware of CC's ideas (Casarosa was present at a talk by CC's CEO Lawrence Lessig) the breadth of CC's worth growths exponentially. It is fascinating to observe the value different groups and individuals see in CC licensing.</p>
