<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21835" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;" title="widgetFINAL" src="img/widgetFINAL1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />Mark your calendars - <a href="http://www.artsengine.net/">Arts Engine</a> is back with its annual <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/">Media That Matters Film Festival</a> on June 2nd in New York City. The festival, now in its <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/news/world_premiere_of_the_tenth_annual_media_that_matters">tenth year</a>, showcases twelve social justice shorts selected by a <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/news/tenth_annual_festival_jury">fantastic jury</a> of filmmakers and activists.</p>
<p>The premiere will take place at The Visual Arts Theater (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=embed&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=visual+arts+theater&amp;sll=40.746655,-73.99925&amp;sspn=0.007332,0.015213&amp;g=333+W+23rd+St,+New+York,+NY+10011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cid=8156893424749466391&amp;ll=40.754214,-73.996181&amp;spn=0.019505,0.036049&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A">Google Map</a>) and will include not only the films featured but also a salonÂ with some of the MTM presenting partners and a chance to meet the festival filmmakers. Be sure to <a href="http://mediathatmatters.eventbrite.com/">purchase tickets</a> in advance if you wish to attend in person.</p>
<p>Following the premiere, the films will be available for purchase under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives license</a> on region-free unencrypted DVDs. This allows activists, educators, fans, and audiences to host their own non-commercial screenings of the shorts without having to negotiate complex contracts with MTM and the many different filmmakers participating in the festival. Those interested should <a href="http://www.artsengine.net/store/items/tenth_annual_media_that_matters_film_festival">preorder a DVD</a>, check out MTM's <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/tools">DIY Screening Guide</a>, and add themselves to the <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/news/screenings">list of existing screenings</a>.</p>
