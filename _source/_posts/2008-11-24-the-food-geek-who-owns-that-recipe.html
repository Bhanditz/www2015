<p>Food writer and culinary culture aficionado Brian J. Geiger maintains a great site called <a href="http://thefoodgeek.com/">The Food Geek</a>, which features a blog, podcasts, recipes, and loads of helpful cooking tips. The site - which combines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastronomica">Gastronomica</a>'s thoughtful analysis and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Brown">Alton Brown</a>'s geeky wisdom - is published under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/">Attribution</a> license. Over the weekend, Geiger posted a column entitled <a href="http://thefoodgeek.com/miscellaneous/who-owns-that-recipe">"Who owns that recipe?,"</a> which explains why recipes can't be copyrighted (while the expression of recipes can) and encourages food knowledge sharing as a way to "make a better life for ideas." Highly recommended for food fans and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051">free cultural works</a> proponents alike.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ideas are better shared than they are stored. Ideas like company. Ideas like new environments. Ideas like to frolic in new brains with other ideas. Itâ€™s how baby ideas are made. Ideas canâ€™t reproduce well alone, so everyone wins if ideas are allowed to be promiscuous. â€¦ How firmly do I believe in this? I have released all of my original work for this site under a Creative Commons License.</p></blockquote>
