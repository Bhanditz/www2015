<p>We are very excited to announce that <a href="http://www.caterina.net/">Caterina Fake</a> has joined the Creative Commons board. Fake cofounded the massively popular photo sharing site and community <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> in early 2004. To date, Flickr's community of photographers have licensed over <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">75 million photos</a> to the public under Creative Commons copyright licenses, making the site one of the biggest sources of permissively licensed material on the Internet. Fake is also a writer and artist, and is currently the Chief Product Officer for startup <a href="http://www.hunch.com/">Hunch</a><span style="LOL"></span>.</p>
<p>This is an excellent addition to the CC team. You can read more about it in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/8949">press release</a> we just posted to publicize the news.</p>
