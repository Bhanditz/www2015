<p>Many institutions that use CC licenses also build free and open source software to support content creation and publishing. The <a href="http://matc.mellon.org/">Mellon Award for Technology Collaboration</a> is an excellent opportunity for such organizations to gain recognition and funding for these software activities.</p>
<p><em>The deadline for nominations for the 2008 Mellon Awards for Technology Collaboration (MATC Awards) is April 14, 2008. The MATC Awards consist of up to ten $50,000 or $100,000 prizes, which a receiving institution can use in a variety of ways to continue its technology leadership. The awards honor not-for-profit institutions that have demonstrated exemplary leadership in the development of open source software for one or more of the constituencies served by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation: the arts and humanities in higher education; research libraries, museums; performing arts organizations; and conservation biology.</em></p>
<p>You can nominate an institution and project <a href="http://matc.mellon.org/nominate">starting here</a>. The <a href="http://matc.mellon.org/faq?full=1">FAQ</a> tells all.
