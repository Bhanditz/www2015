<p><a href="http://www.bigego.com/egog/article.php?story=20040504090919481">Jim</a> will pick three to five of his favorite remixes from our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4162">remix contest</a> to be featured on National Public Radio's <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/">All Things Considered</a> this June.  The piece will be about this contest.</p>
<p>
Jim says his deadline for entries will be June 10th.  We'll still feature our favorite song on our web site as of May 28th.  </p>
<p>
Post your entries to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4162">remix contest blog post</a> or <a href="mailto:info@creativecommons.org">send us</a> an email.  Given that there aren't too many remixes up there, your chances of being heard on the radio -- all over the country -- are pretty good.  Even if you're not a musician, load up <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a> or <a href="http://mediasoftware.sonypictures.com/products/acidfamily.asp">Acid</a> and take a crack at it!  Maybe there's even some good open-source music mixing software -- anyone know?</p>
<p>
If you need hosting for your remix, the <a href="http://www.archive.org/audio/collection.php?collection=opensource_audio">Internet Archive</a> provides free hosting for Creative Commons licensed music.</p></p>
