<p><a href="http://www.thewebstersdictionary.com/"><em>The Websters' Dictionary: How to Use the Web to Transform the World</em></a> is a newly released book on "how to create communities of thousands [...] and channel their energy to effect political, social and cultural transformation." Written by tech-advocate and political theorist <a href="http://www.thewebstersdictionary.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=30">Ralph Benko</a>, <em>The Websters' Dictionary</em> aims to educate on the web's potential to motivate groups and enact change on broader issues, all while keeping in mind the complexities inherent in organizing movements online.</p>
<p>While the book is aimed at those with mid-level web experience, <em>The Websters' Dictionary</em> has salient points that should resonate across technical prowess and familiarity. <em>The Websters' Dictionary</em> is available for <a href="http://www.thewebstersdictionary.com/">free PDF download</a> - after taking the "Websters' Oath" -  and is being released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC license</a>, meaning that it can be reused in any number of ways, as long as future works credit Ralph Benko and are noncommercial in intent. Hardcover and paperbacks versions of the book should be available in October.</p>
