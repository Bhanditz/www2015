<p>Steve Jurveston <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/68348812/">comments</a> about cool uses of his CC-licensed photos on Flickr:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine my surprise when I heard that the Charlie Rose show found my photo on flickr and wanted to use it on broadcast TV.</p>
<p>They were interviewing Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel and seer of exponential trends in technology (â€œMooreâ€™s Lawâ€). They wanted a photo of Dr. Moore pursuing his passion for fishing, and they found my photo entitled Moore Fish.</p>
<p>Thanks to Larry Lessig and the Creative Commons license for making this so easy. There have been so many cool uses and remixes of my photos ever since I switched from copyright to CC in flickr, including textbooks on lasers, fourth grade geography projects, and a variety of very cool graphic art mash ups from Argentina.</p>
