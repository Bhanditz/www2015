<p>The language learning website, <a title="http://www.italki.com/" href="http://www.italki.com/" target="_blank">italki.com</a>, has been around as a social networking site since 2006. Starting in April, they decided to develop a new version of italki: <a title="http://www.italki.com/knowledge/" href="http://www.italki.com/knowledge/" target="_blank">italki Knowledge</a>. italki Knowledge is made up of a bunch of wikis functioning as open textbooks---free for anyone to access and edit. The wikis span a multitude of languages, learnable in almost as many (you can learn Korean using German, Spanish using Mandarin, vice versa and more). <a title="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/index.php?id=2972&amp;utm_source=wc&amp;utm_medium=en" href="http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/index.php?id=2972&amp;utm_source=wc&amp;utm_medium=en" target="_blank">The Wired Campus</a>Â reports that the site really only took off this month, so make sure to check it out and contribute if you can.</p>
