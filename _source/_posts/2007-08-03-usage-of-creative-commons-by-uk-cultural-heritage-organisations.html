<p>The Eduserv Foundation is funding an important study on the <a href="http://www.eduserv.org.uk/foundation/studies/cc2007">use of open licensing at cultural heritage institutions in the UK</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A study titled "The Common Information Environment and Creative Commons" was funded by Becta, the British Library, DfES, JISC and the MLA on behalf of the Common Information Environment. The work was carried out by Intrallect and the AHRC Research Centre for studies in Intellectual Property and Technology Law and a report was produced in the Autumn of 2005. During the Common Information Environment study it was noted that there was considerable enthusiasm for the use of Creative Commons licences from both cultural heritage organisations and the educational and research community. In this study we aim to investigate if this enthusiasm is still strong and whether a significant number of cultural heritage organisations are publishing digital resources under open content licences.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you know anyone working in the cultural heritage sector in the UK please encourage them to <a href="http://www.eduserv.org.uk/foundation/studies/cc2007">participate via an online survey</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to similar in-depth and ongoing research into the impact of CC in additional jurisdictions and subject areas.</p>
