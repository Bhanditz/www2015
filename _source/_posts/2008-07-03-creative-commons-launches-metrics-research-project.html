<p><strong>San Francisco, USA â€” 2008 July 3</strong></p>
<p>Today Creative Commons (CC) announced the official launch of the Metrics project, a broad-based open web-based initiative to encourage and collect research efforts on the adoption of CC licenses worldwide. At the freely editable wiki, anyone may participate in analyzing data about Creative Commons licenses. The site is designed to act as an open collective space for gathering, processing, and visualizing the most up-to-date statistics on the current state of CC licensing, including the total number of licenses used, the types of active licenses, and access to various privacy-scrubbed data dumps useful in analyzing CC license uptake.</p>
<p>As a wiki, this project also extends an open invitation for users to join the research community to expand the scope of the project. Nathan Yergler, CC's CTO commented, â€œWe're extremely excited about the possibilities of opening up research on this topic to the public. The Semantic Mediawiki format is a huge help in building a community around these issues.â€ Anyone is able to review the research aggregated at the Metrics portal, contribute information on existing works, or add their own original research. While it is quite complicated to do an authoritative search and calculation on the entire Internet, this project's intent is to lower the barrier for participation in discovering more accurate statistics on CC licensing collaboratively.</p>
<p>Creative Commons license use is growing. As of June 2008, Creative Commons estimates that a minimum of 130 million creative works are licensed by creators opting to provide clear expression of how their works may be used on the web. The Metrics project aims to deepen the public's understanding of how this mass adoption is shaping business and culture at-large. As Mike Linksvayer, Vice-President of CC, stated, â€œCreative Commons is founded on a mission to promote a more dynamic and open cultural space. By opening data dumps about Creative Commons license usage to the public, CC provides a way for anyone to help generate a more detailed picture of how CC licenses are a user-friendly interface to copyright for creators and businesses alike. Metrics are vital to understanding how CC is transforming the creative ecosystem.â€ And, with the launch of the Creative Commons Case Studies project last week, CC expanded the qualitative information available about license usage. The release of the Metrics project today extends the quantitative data available for further exploration and understanding of how Creative Commons licenses are spreading globally.</p>
<p>â€œWhat's important to recognize,â€ said Linksvayer, â€œis that the Metrics project works to compliment current existing collaboration between CC and research groups internationally.â€ This includes the work by Giorgos Cheliotis and Warren Chik at the Participatory Media Lab, a research center based in Singapore, that is working with CC to tackle some of the analytical questions surrounding its progress worldwide. Cheliotis recently launched the Commons-Research website and mailing list which actively supports discussion and collaboration about commons-based peer production.</p>
<p>The release of the Metrics project online is set to coincide with the First Interdisciplinary Research Workshop on Free Culture being held in Sapporo, Japan from July 30th to August 1st. This workshop, spearheaded by Giorgos Cheliotis with Tyng-Ruey Chuang and Jonathan Zittrain, will bring together researchers and scholars from around the world to discuss commons-based peer production research and present their latest works in progress publicly. More information on how to participate in the Metrics project and relevant upcoming events are available on the Creative Commons Metrics project website.</p>

<p><strong>About Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licenses, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms that build upon the â€œall rights reservedâ€ concept of traditional copyright to enable a voluntary â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach. Creative Commons was built with and is sustained by the generous support of organizations including the Center for the Public Domain, Omidyar Network, The Rockefeller Foundation, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, as well as members of the public.
