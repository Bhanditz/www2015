<p>Thanks to the great work of Asheesh Laroia, Software Engineer here at Creative Commons, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/Liblicense">libLicense</a> software package is now available for software developers.  The new package can now be found in both <a href="http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/liblicense">Debian</a> and <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/liblicense/0.8-1/+build/686396">Ubuntu</a> (development versions) and will be in Fedora soon.</p>
<p>That is all well and good, but what does it mean for you and what can you do (as a developer)?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, try it!  Tell us what you think of its functionality and interface.</li>
<li>Secondly, integrate it into your application. There is interest in getting it into <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, the Open Source vector graphics editor.</li>
<li>Finally, you can help us improve our test cases.  Read more about this in <a href="http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-devel/2008-July/001067.html">Asheesh's email</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great time to add Creative Commons licensing awareness to your applications. </p>
