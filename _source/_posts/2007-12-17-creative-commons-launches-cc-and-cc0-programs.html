<p>We are very excited to announce the launch of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/ccplus">CC+</a> (aka CC Plus) and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/cczero">CC0</a> (aka CC Zero) programs. These are major additions to the Creative Commons array of legal tools.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, CC+ is a protocol to enable a simple way for users to get rights beyond those granted by a CC license.Â  Meanwhile, CC0 is a protocol that enables people to either assert that a work has no legal restrictions attached to it or waive any rights associated with a work so it has no legal restrictions attached to it. The program also provides an easy way to sign these assertions or waivers.</p>
<p>Please read our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/7919">press release</a> about the launch of CC+ and CC0 for more information about how they work and who we're collaborating with.</p>
