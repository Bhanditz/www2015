<p>"Advanced Marketing Services, a San Diego-based distributor that expects to handle about 2 million [fortcoming Harry] Potter books between Saturday and January 2004, has hired security guards in the United States and added guard dogs for a Canadian distributor it partially owns. . . . </p>
<p>'I canÂ’t let you touch the book,' warned Bill Carr, Amazon.comÂ’s director of books, music, videos and DVDs. He gestured toward some of the more than 200,000 books -- about 150 tons worth -- that will be shipped to West Coast destinations.</p>
<p>Similar operations are under way at Amazon.comÂ’s four other major regional distribution centers in Newcastle, Del.; Coffeyville, Kan.; Campbellsville, Ky.; and Lexington, Ky.</p>
<p>The 896-page books were locked in special rooms when they arrived at the warehouse. They were cordoned off from the rest of building by a pair of security guards, who were not allowed to talk to reporters. Reporters were searched on their way out of the building."</p>
