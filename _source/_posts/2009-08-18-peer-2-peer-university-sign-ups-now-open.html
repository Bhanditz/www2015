<p>The sign-up phase of <a href="http://p2pu.org/">Peer 2 Peer University</a> opened late last week during Open Ed 09 in Vancouver. What is P2PU? It's "an online community of open study groups for short university-level courses. Think of it as online book clubs for open educational resources. The P2PU helps you navigate the wealth of open education materials that are out there, creates small groups of motivated learners, and supports the design and facilitation of courses."</p>
<p><a href="http://p2pu.org">P2PU</a> is launching its pilot phase in the fall with select courses ranging from "<a href="http://p2pu.org/BE-Outline">Behavioral Economics and Decision Making</a>" to "<a href="http://p2pu.org/OCN%C2%A0Outline">Open Creative Nonfiction Writing</a>" to "<a href="http://p2pu.org/PO-Poker%C2%A0Outline">Poker and Strategic Thinking</a>." The awesome thing about P2PU is that the default for most course material is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, which means that anyone can use, adapt, build upon, and redistribute the courses after the pilot phase--including setting up for more advanced courses down the line. </p>
<p>Sign-up for courses closes on August 26, so be sure to apply soon, as not all courses can accommodate more than a certain number of participants. Courses begin on September 9. See the official <a href="http://p2pu.org/News_17August09">press release</a>!</p>
