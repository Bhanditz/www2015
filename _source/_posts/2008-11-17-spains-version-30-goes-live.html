The six standard <span class="searchterm2">Creative</span> <span class="searchterm3">Commons</span> licenses are now legally and linguistically adapted to Spanish law and available in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=es">Castilian</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=ca">Catalan</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=eu">Basque</a>, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">with a Galician translation coming soon</span> and now <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/?lang=gl">Galician</a>.</p>
<p>CC Spain and Catalonia is lead by Ignasi Labastida i Juan and in affiliation with the renown <a href="http://www.ub.edu/">Universitat de Barcelona</a>, The Spanish community continues to rank among <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Metrics#Research_and_Presentations">the most frequent and permissive license users</a>, and the country hosts numerous CC-powered projects and proponents, including the collaborative <a href="http://www.freesound.org/">Freesound</a> database, <a href="http://www.netaudio.es/">netAudio.es</a> and its associated netlabels, several departments of the Catalan government, and institutions like <a href="http://www.udg.edu">Universitat de Girona</a> with dedicated open resources for research and learning. <a href="http://www.udg.edu"><br />

<p>"Version 3.0 of the licenses is more robust and clarifies some aspects related to moral rights and rights collective management," explains Ignasi Labastida i Juan. "We now have many users, but there is still a lot of work to do to explain the meaning of using a CC license in specific fields."</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/">Creative Commons International</a>, a project of Creative Commons, continues to work with legal experts and professionals around the world to ensure the licenses' global interoperability and their jurisdictional legal certainty.</p>
