<p>If you're in Los Angeles tonight, visit <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#77">Cameron Parkins</a>, who will be representing Creative Commons with a booth at <a href="http://www.artknowsnoborders.com/">Art Knows No Borders</a> (see this <a href="http://flavorpill.com/losangeles/events/2008/11/18/art-knows-know-borders">Flavorpill</a> write-up for details). The fundraising event for <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> will include art, music, videos, and more. Cameron will be on hand to answer questions about Creative Commons and make the case for why you should also contribute to CC's current <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/">Help Build the Commons</a> support drive.</p>
