<p>The ever enthusiastic <a href="http://www.severedfifth.com/">musician</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">community leader</a>, and now author Jono Bacon has just announced his next Creative Commons licensed endeavor: a book published by <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> on building, maintaining, and energizing communities called <strong>Art of Community</strong>.<br />
<br />

The <a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/2009/01/14/the-art-of-community/">announcement</a> posted on <a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org">artofcommunityonline.org</a> explains the project:</p>
<blockquote><p>The book covers a wide range of topics designed to build strong community. This includes the structure and social economy behind community, building effective and easy to use infrastructure, setting up community processes, creating buzz and excitement, governance, conflict resolution, scalability and more. </p></blockquote>
<p>The book won't just be for people interested in Open Source communities, but instead the principles and concepts can be applied to any community: political campaigns, student groups, or even neighborhood crime watches.</p>
<p>When released the book will be available in print from your favorite supplier of O'Reilly books and will also be available online under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license.  Jono is a believer in Creative Commons licensing as can be seen from his music project <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10174">Severed Fifth</a> and the use of CC licenses for the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11053">Ubuntu Free Culture Showcase</a>.  Adding this book to his repertoire of CC-licensed content shows just how far one person can go when embracing the ideals of Free Culture.</p>
