<p>Stanford University will host a <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/">Spectrum Policy Conference</a> March 1st and 2nd.  The topic:  the importance of the airwaves, and the ever-increasing number of wireless  devices relying on them, to a healthy communications policy.   The central question:  Spectrum, property or commons?  With FCC Chairman Powell and many other noteworthies in attendance, it promises to be an enlightening weekend. <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/spectrum/">Registration</a> is now open.</p>
