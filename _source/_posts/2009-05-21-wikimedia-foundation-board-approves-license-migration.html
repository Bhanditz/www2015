<p>The Wikimedia Foundation board has <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/05/21/wikimedia-community-approves-license-migration/">approved</a> the licensing changes voted on by the community of Wikipedia and its sister sites. The accompanying <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/Dual_license_vote_May_2009">press release</a> includes this quote from Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Richard Stallman's commitment to the cause of free culture has been an inspiration to us all. Assuring the interoperability of free culture is a critical step towards making this freedom work. The Wikipedia community is to be congratulated for its decision, and the Free Software Foundation thanked for its help. I am enormously happy about this decision."</p></blockquote>
<p>Hear, hear!</p>
<p>Earlier today we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14647">blogged that results of the Wikipedia community vote</a> on adding the CC BY-SA license. Over 75% of votes were cast in approval of the change, but as has been pointed out by Wikimedia Foundation Deputy Director <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14647#comment-211254">Erik Moeller</a> and board member <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/4443939">Kat Walsh</a>, this number understates the level of support for the change. 14% voted "no opinion", while only 10% opposed.</p>
<p>In any case we are deeply gratified that such an overwhelming majority (88% of those who voted with an opinion) approved this change worked on over several years by the Free Software Foundation, Wikimedia Foundation, and Creative Commons, are proud to stand with such trusted organizations, and will live up to that trust!</p>
<p>The addition of the CC BY-SA license to Wikimedia sites should occur over the next month. Now is a good time to start thinking about whether your works and projects ought to interoperate with Wikipedia. If you're using (or switch to) CC BY-SA, content can flow in both directions (your work could be incorporated into Wikipedia, and you can incorporate Wikipedia content into your work). If you use CC BY or CC0, your work could be incorporated into Wikipedia, but not vice versa. If your work isn't licensed, or is under a CC license with a non-commercial or no derivatives (NC or ND) term, nothing can flow in either direction, except by fair use or other copyright exception or limitation.</p>
