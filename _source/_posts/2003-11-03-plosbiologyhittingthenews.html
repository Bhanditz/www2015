The <a href="http://plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a>, an open access journal we covered as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/plos">a featured commoner</a>, has released new articles from its upcoming Biology issue (which is also Creative Commons licensed). One article in particular (<a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/pips/plbi-01-03-S-froguel.pdf">PDF synopsis</a>) details a study that found a strong association between obesity and a gene on chromosome 10. As obesity is quickly becoming a major health issue in many industrialized nations, the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=obesity+gene&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&edition=us&scoring=d">news of this article</a> has been spreading quickly.</p>
