<p>Annalee Newitz has a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/39467/">fun suggestion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean, it's no accident that a horror movie like "The Ring" came out during the heyday of file sharing. Let's think about it -- the flick is about a haunted videocassette that will kill you unless you make a duplicate copy and show it to somebody else. It's like a nightmare analog version of BitTorrent. If you do not share your media, you will die. Creative Commons really should do a cartoon parody of "The Ring."</p></blockquote>
<p>I've never heard of this movie though Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring">confirms the plotline</a>. Clearly a multiple-plotline parody is in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Character one must copy DRM media or die. Circumvents DRM, goes to jail, attacked by gang, dies.</li>
<li>Character two must copy DRM media or die. Atttempts to circumvent DRM, fails, dies.</li>
<li>Character three must copy DRM media or die. Realizes circumventing DRM is criminal, has moral crisis but in the end does the right thing, dies.</li>
<li>Character four must copy CC licensed media or die. Makes copy, shares with friends and strangers, remixes, is remixed, lives long and prospers.</li>
</ul>
