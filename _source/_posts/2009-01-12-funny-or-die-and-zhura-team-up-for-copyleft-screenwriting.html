<p>The aptly named <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com">Funny or Die</a> comedy community has launched a competition with the free on-line screen writing software site <a href="http://www.zhura.com">Zhura</a>. All contributions must be licensed under our <a href="http://enwp.org/copyleft">copyleft</a> license, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA)</a> so that Funny or Die's producers can create the shows freely. Consequently, Funny or Die episodes based on submissions to the competition will be reciprocally licensed under BY-SA as well:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q. What if I don't want anyone to touch my script?</strong><br />
A. In order to be considered by the head writers for production, your script MUST carry the BY-SA Creative Commons License. This does two things: It lets Funny Or Die UK produce your sketch and it allows Zhura members (and Funny or Die UK head writers) edit your script as necessary to make it better (sorry). </p></blockquote>
<p>If you've been itching to show the web how funny you are, now's your chance. <a href="http://www.zhura.com/contests/home/4">Read more about the competition over at Zhura's site</a>. </p>
