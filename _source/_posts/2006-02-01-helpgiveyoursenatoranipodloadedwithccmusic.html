<p>During last week's Senate hearing on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_flag">Broadcast Flag</a>, Senator <a href="http://stevens.senate.gov/">Ted Stevens</a> revealed that his daughter had recently <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004343.php">bought him an iPod</a> -- and that he enjoys using it to <a href="http://news.com.com/Senate+may+hoist+broadcast+flag+again/2100-1025_3-6030454.html">listen to ripped CDs</a>. In turn, <a href="http://www.ipaction.org/">IPac</a> has launched a drive to collect money to <a href="http://www.ipaction.org/campaigns/ipod/">buy iPods for other senators</a> who work on technology legislation. They've promised to load the machines with "public domain content, Creative Commons content, and audio messages about the importance of balanced copyright policy."</p>
