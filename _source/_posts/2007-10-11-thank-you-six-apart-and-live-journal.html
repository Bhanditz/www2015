<p>Last night at the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7716">CC Salon</a> in San Francisco, <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/unfiltered/2007/10/circling-the-ba.html">Six Apart presented CC</a> with an impressive donation raised entirely by their LiveJournal community through <a href="http://news.livejournal.com/100876.html">sales of permanent accounts</a>. Over 600 people bought permanent accounts and chose Creative Commons as a recipient of a portion of that sale.</p>
<p>CC CEO Lawrence Lessig was on hand to accept the check. He praised Six Apart for being one of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3594">very first companies to build a CC license option into content creation software</a>. Six Apart is also one of the first implementers of our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Jswidget">licensing widget</a> --<a href="http://everything.typepad.com/cc/"> integration with Six Apart's TypePad hosted blogging service</a> was demoed at the Salon.</p>
<p>Thank you Six Apart!</p>
<p>This was a great way to really kick off our 3rd annual fundraising campaign -- a truly community driven contribution! Please <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/donate">join Six Apart and the LiveJournal community in sustaining Creative Commons</a>.</p>
