<p>This week's featured content is <a href="http://www.maion.com/photography/">Nomads' Land</a>, a site for photographs taken by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Ma&iuml;on during travels around the globe. A great place to start exploring the site is <a href="http://www.maion.com/photography/index.html#locations">the map on the main page</a>. All 1000+ photos are licensed under a Creative Commons license and we can wait to see where Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois travels to next.</p>
