Billed as the world's first remixed and remixable anthology of literature, the whole project is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/au/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a> and is available as a free digital download (<a href="http://www.remixmylit.com/wp-content/pdf/Through-the-Clocks-Workings-EBook.pdf">PDF</a>) or as a <a href="http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/sup/9781920899325">hardcopy purchase</a> through the <a href="http://www.sup.usyd.edu.au/">Sydney University Press e-store</a>. More from <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/node/243">CCau</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those who have been following our blog will remember the beautifully simplistic premise of the <a href="http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/">Australia Council</a> funded Remix My Lit project - take stories from 9 prominent Australian authors, release them for remixing under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/au/">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike licence</a>, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Through the Clockâ€™s Workings gives us a taste of the result. Published by the <a href="http://www.sup.usyd.edu.au/">Sydney University Press</a>, this anthology brings together the original 9 stories - from authors such as <a href="http://www.jamesphelan.com.au/">James Phelan</a>, <a href="http://www.scribepublications.com.au/author/catekennedy">Cate Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://fantasticthoughts.wordpress.com/">Kim Wilkins</a> - with 13 of the best remixes [...] the diversity is great - there are poems, abridgements, gender switches, complete re-imaginings. Even the cover of the the book you can see above is a remix of the stories by the excellent artist <a href="http://www.alijart.com/">Ali J</a>.</p></blockquote>
