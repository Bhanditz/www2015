<p><a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com" title="BioMed Central" target="_blank">BioMed Central</a> (BMC) is one of the largest open access (OA) publishers in the world with 250 peer-reviewed OA journals, and more than 100,000 OA articles published yearly. BMC is also long-time user of CC licenses to accomplish its mission of husbanding and promoting open science. BMC has been publishing articles under a CC license since 2004.</p>
<p>In June of least year, BMC's Iain Hrynaszkiewicz and Matthew Cockerill, published an editorial titled <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/5/494" title="Open by default" target="_blank">Open by default</a> in which they proposed a <em>copyright license and waiver agreement for open access research and data in peer-reviewed journals</em>. The gist of the editorial was that</p>
<blockquote><p>
Copyright and licensing of scientific data, internationally, are complex and present legal barriers to data sharing, integration and reuse, and therefore restrict the most efficient transfer and discovery of scientific knowledge, (and that implementing) a combined Creative Commons Attribution license (for copyrightable material) and Creative Commons CC0 waiver (for data) agreement for content published in peer-reviewed open access journalsâ€¦ in science publishing will help clarify what usersâ€”people and machinesâ€”of the published literature can do, legally, with journal articles and make research using the published literature more efficient.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Starting September 3, 2013, in keeping with its forward-looking mission, BMC started requiring a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0" title="CC0 Public Domain Dedication" target="_blank">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a> for data supporting the published articles.</p>
<p>This is good because CC0 reduces all impedance to sharing and reuse by placing the work in the public domain. Good scientific practices assure proper credit is given via citation, something   scientists have already been doing for centuries. Marking data with CC0 sends a clear signal of zero impedance to reuse. CC0 is a public domain dedication, however, wherever such a dedication is not possible, CC0 has a public license fallback. Either way, the impedance to data reuse is eliminated or minimized. Making CC0 the default removes uncertainty, and speeds up the process of accessible, collaborative, participatory and inclusive science.</p>
<p>But wait, there is moreâ€¦ starting February 3, 2014, BMC, <a href="http://www.chemistrycentral.com" title="Chemistry Central" target="_blank">Chemistry Central</a> and all of <a href="http://www.springeropen.com" title="SpringerOpen" target="_blank">SpringerOpen</a> family of journals are also <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2013/12/18/moving-forward-biomed-centrals-open-access-license-is-being-updated-to-cc-by-4-0/" target="_blank">Moving Forward</a> to the latest CC BY 4.0 license. <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2013/12/18/cc-by-4-0/" target="_blank">Changes in CC-BY â€” version 4.0</a>, released on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768" target="_blank">Nov 25, 2013</a>, represent more than two years of community process, public input and feedback to develop a truly open, global license suitable for both copyright, related rights and, where applicable, database rights. By moving to CC4.0, BMC is not only getting set for reliable, globally recognizable mark of open, it is also setting a high bar for the future of open science.</p>
<p>We at Creative Commons are big fans of BMC, and we applaud their move to creating a stronger, more vibrant open commons of science.</p>
