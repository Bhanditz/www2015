<p>San Francisco event to feature performances by Gilberto Gil and DJ Spooky plus announcements from Lawrence Lessig and Joi Ito</p>
<p>On December 16, 2007, Creative Commons will turn five years old. In celebration of this milestone, Creative Commons will host a celebration on Saturday, December 15, 2007 in San Francisco. Since the Creative Commons community is international, the organization is encouraging people around the world to host their own parties concurrently. There are currently parties being organized in Beijing, Berlin, Belgrade, Brisbane, Los Angeles, New York, Pasay City, San Francisco, and Seoul. Details or to register a party in another city, are listed <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Birthday_Party">here</a>.</p>

The event will feature a performance by Tropicalia superstar and Brazilian Minister of Culture <a href="http://www.gilbertogil.com.br/">Gilberto Gil</a>, along with his son Bem Gil. There will also be music provided by <a href="http://www.djspooky.com/">DJ Spooky</a>, live video remixing by <a href="http://www.phi-phenomenon.com/">Phi Phenomenon</a>, and announcements by Creative Commons CEO <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> and Creative Commons chairman <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a>.</p>
<p>â€œWeâ€™re proud to be a sponsor of this landmark event, as weâ€™ve always been firm believers in the Creative Commons endeavor,â€ said Martin Stiksel, Last.fmâ€™s co-founder. â€œWe use CC licenses for our Web services and APIs, and strive alongside the CC team to provide artists with the resources to stay in control of their own work. We look forward to the next 50 years of CC!â€</p>
<p>"Mozilla shares Creative Commons' commitment to creating a participatory culture through public benefit work," said Mike Shaver, Chief Evangelist at Mozilla. "We're proud of what they've achieved, honored to be a supporter of their endeavors, and excited to see what the future will bring."</p>
