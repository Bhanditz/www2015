<p>Steps towards openness were taken yesterday by the University of Oregon Library, as its faculty unanimously passed a <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~jqj/lib-deposit-faq.html">resolution</a> requiring all library faculty-authored scholarly articles to be licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/fosblog.html">Peter Suber</a> of Open Access News). Although NC-ND does not allow derivations (which may include translations and other adaptations) of the articles, library faculty also have the option of licensing their works under one of the more open licenses, including <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>. </p>
<p>We highly encourage library faculty (and libraries in general) everywhere to consider adopting these more open CC licenses for their content (especially <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>). If you remember from last October, the University of Michigan Library <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10109">adopted CC BY-NC</a> for all of its works, including those to which the University of Michigan held copyrights. Stripping away the ND term enables collaboration across institutions, as you are granted more than the simple right to access, but to also adapt, translate, and improve the work.</p>
<p>However, adopting CC BY-NC-ND is a step in the right direction. From the <a href="https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/4943.html">announcement</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"We largely followed the leads of Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and most recently Oregon State (our friends and rivals).  One area where we differ is in explicitly mandating a CC-BY-NC-ND license.  Choosing that license was very conscious.  <strong>We believe that it is vital that the community standardize on a small number of licenses to move beyond the present mess where every publisher and practically every author has their own unique terms.  The license we chose is a good candidate for standardization.</strong> ... Authors who wish to can of course also license their works under a more liberal license such as CC-BY-SA."</p></blockquote>
