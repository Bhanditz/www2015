<p>Itâ€™s a ccSalonâ€¦ with a twist of sausage.</p>
<p>Down south in South Africa we have the much-revered summer practice of the â€˜<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braai">braai</a>â€™.  The braai is just like a barbeque, except with a better selection of meat and southern blue skies.  At a braai the norm is for people to bring their own meat and drink.  Salads, breads, desserts and cold-drinks are usually supplied by the hosts.  Hence we call it the â€˜bring â€˜n braai.â€™</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org:81/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/safclogosmall.jpg" title="SA Free Culture tour logo"><img src="img/safclogosmall.jpg" alt="SA Free Culture tour logo" align="left" height="126" width="126" /></a>Interesting but not relevant you may think.  Have we confused CC with <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>?  Indeed not.  On 20 April Creative Commons South Africa is hosting its second ccSalon at <a href="http://www.armchairtheatre.co.za/">The Independent Armchair Theatre</a> in Cape Town, aka the Mother City.  And weâ€™re challenging creators to add to the pool of free culture by CC-licensing and uploading their creative digital works via the ccSalonâ€™s <a href="http://www.icommons.org/bringnbraai/">bring â€˜n braai</a> website.  Folks coming to the ccSalon are urged to bring their iPods and memory sticks where they can download these works via the <a href="http://www.freedomtoaster.org/">Freedom Toaster</a>.  So - itâ€™s a bring â€˜n braai.</p>
<p>To help us jam, remix, share and braai, Larry Lessig and Jimmy Wales will be at the salon as part of the <a href="http://icommons.org/events/">SA Free Culture Tour</a> which takes place from Wednesday, 18 April to Friday, 20 April 2007.  The tour has already received a great deal of publicity in the blogosphere and a buzz amongst mainstream SA media.</p>
