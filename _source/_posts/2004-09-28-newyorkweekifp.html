<p>On Friday the 24th I attended the final day of <a href="http://market.ifp.org/newyork/market/market26/noflash/">IFP New York</a>'s week-long conference on independent film.</p>
<p>I felt very lucky and humbled (frequent feelings lately) to be on an afternoon panel, "<a href="http://market.ifp.org/newyork/market/market26/noflash/">Responding to the Copyright Crisis</a>," with such heavies as <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0850038/">Jonathan Taplin</a> (producer of <em>To Die For</em>, <em>Mean Streets</em>, among other films); Marjorie Heins (founder of the <a href="http://www.fepproject.org/fepp/aboutfepp.html">Free Expression Policy Project</a>); <a href="http://www.antidotefilms.com/">Jeff Levy-Hinte</a> (producer of <em>Thirteen</em> and editor of <em>When We Were Kings</em>); Michael Donaldson (author of <em><a href="http://www.writersstore.com/product.php?products_id=137">Clearance and Copyright</a></em>); and Mark Nadel (author of, among many other pieces, the thought-provoking copyright article "<a href="http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=489762">The Overlooked Impact of Marketing</a>"). <a href="http://www.bollier.org">David Bollier</a>, author of the forthcoming <em>Brand-Name Bullies</em>, moderated.</p>
<p>After the panel, <a href="http://eff.org/~barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>, who helped bring many people into the information debate back in the 1990s -- even those of us who disagreed with him --  waxed eloquent about the parallels between riparian rights (that's water law) and copyright, and the connection between today's information policy debate and current events around the world. He finished with a note of cautious optimism: "The dinosaurs are dying, there's no doubt about that. But being locked in a dark closet with dying dinosaur doesn't mean you're going to come out okay. So we have to be brave." It was a fitting, funny, and inspiring ending to the week.</p>
