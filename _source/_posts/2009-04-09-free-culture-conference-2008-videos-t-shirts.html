Before working for Creative Commons full time, <a href="http://fredbenenson.com/blog/2008/09/08/free-culture-nyu-moves-on/">I was a student activist in the Students for Free Culture movement</a>. I'm still on the board of the organization (though this will change shortly as I am not seeking reelection <a href="http://freeculture.org/blog/2009/03/31/reminder-campaigning-for-sfc-board09-closes-in-5-days/">in the upcoming board race</a>), and I helped work on the <a href="http://conference.freeculture.org">Free Culture Conference 2008</a> at Berkeley. <a href="http://freeculture.berkeley.edu/Free_Culture_at_Berkeley.html">The Free Culture @ Berkeley</a> team did a smash-up job of running the conference and recording all of the video for archival purposes and now all the videos are available online.</p>
<p> There are some really fantastic talks in here, including a keynote interview with <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1777672">John Lily Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://freecultureberkeley.blip.tv/file/1777445/">Anthony Falzone on Fair Use</a>, and <a href="http://freecultureberkeley.blip.tv/posts?view=archive&nsfw=dc">many more</a>.  Check out <a href="http://freecultureberkeley.blip.tv/">the blip.tv channel here</a> and download all the Attribution licensed videos.<br />

<p>We also commissioned a design for <a href="http://www.freeculture.org/t-shirts/">free culture t-shirts</a> from <a href="http://www.patrickmoberg.com/">Patrick Moberg</a>. We are now retailing them through a modest <a href="http://www.freeculture.org/t-shirts/">PayPal storefront here</a> for $20 + S/H, and all proceeds will go to help Students for Free Culture grow. The shirt designs are CC licensed under Attribution-ShareAlike, so feel free to download the files and make your own!</p>
