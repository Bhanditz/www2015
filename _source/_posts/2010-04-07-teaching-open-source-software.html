<p>If you're like me, then you don't know much about software; if you're not like me, then you know about software but not much about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software">open source software</a> (OSS). Regardless of which camp you fall into, there's good news---you can learn about open source software (and help others learn about it) through open educational resources on OSS online. <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Textbook_Release_0.8">Practical Open Source Software Exploration: <em>How to be Productively Lost, the Open Source Way</em></a> is <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/">teachingopensource.org</a>'s new textbook to help professors, or anyone for that matter, teach or learn about open source software. "<a href="http://opensource.com/education/10/4/can-professors-teach-open-source">It's a book that works like an open source software project. In other words: patches welcome.</a>" </p>
<p>For those needing something quick and simple to hand out to their classes, educators can contribute to or adapt this textbook (it's licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a> so you can share, translate, remix as long as you share alike) or <a href="http://discovered.creativecommons.org/">search</a> for other OER online. One K-12 educator developed this resource under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, <a href="http://mairin.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/a-k12-educators-guide-to-open-source-software/">A K-12 Educator's Guide to Open Source Software</a>.</p>
<p>Via CC licenses, both resources enable a community of educators and learners to contribute to, edit, and improve them, especially <a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/Textbook_Release_0.8">Practical Open Source Software Exploration</a> which invites people to edit the wiki directly. But fostering a community around open resources to keep them up-to-date and relevant isn't something that just magically happens, which is why <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>, a successful business built around OSS, developed this meta-resource: <a href="http://www.theopensourceway.org/book/">The Open Source Way: Creating and nurturing communities of contributors</a>. The book is available in <a href="https://www.theopensourceway.org/wiki/Main_Page">wiki-form</a> also under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA</a>, and "it contains knowledge distilled from years of Red Hat experience, which itself comes from the many years of experience of individual upstream contributors who have worked for Red Hat." Basically, it's a guide "for helping people to understand how to and how not to engage with community over projects such as software, content, marketing, art, infrastructure, standards, and so forth." Of course none of this is set in stone (literally), since what works for some might not for others, but it's worth taking a look and adapting to your own needs. </p>
