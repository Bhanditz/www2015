This week's featured content is the wonderfully wacky and off-the-wall stuff at <a href="http://www.goopymart.com/">Goopymart</a>. Flash movies and animated comics feature a variety of animal-like creatures. <a href="http://www.goopymart.com/yuggy/yuggy.html">Yuggy</a> is my favorite and a longtime popular fixture of the Goopy universe.</p>
