<p><a href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2010/public/schedule/detail/11757"><img src="img/webexsf2010_speaker_banner_125x125.jpg" width="125" height="125" border="0" style="float:right;padding:10px" alt="Web 2.0 Expo San Francisco 2010" title="Web 2.0 Expo San Francisco 2010" /></a>Thursday a panel at Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco explores an important question for anyone building or participating in a website premised on collaboration among users -- <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2010/public/schedule/detail/11757">Creating a Culture of Sharing</a> -- maximizing collaboration and minimizing conflict and other costs.</p>
<p>This is an important question not only for entrepreneurs and communities, but for the commons generally -- the success of which depends significantly on the vibrancy of sites where the commons is built. So I'm happy to participate on this panel with representatives of two such sites -- Jack Herrick of wikiHow and Emily Richards of ArtisTech Media (which has <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18867">run ccMixter</a> since last year). The panel will be moderated by Josh Crandall of Netpop Research, which conducted a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127">study on noncommercial use</a> with Creative Commons last year.</p>
<p>Previewing the panel, the <a href="http://blog.web2expo.com/2010/05/jack-herrick-of-wikihow-talks-to-w2e-about-the-culture-of-sharing/">Web 2.0 Expo blog has published an excellent interview with Jack Herrick</a>, worth reading in its entirety. Excerpt:<br />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kaitlin</strong>: So, out with it â€“ how do you create a â€œCulture of Sharingâ€? Or at least, what would your 1 minute elevator pitch be?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: We like to call wikiHow "<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Tour/Built-to-Share">built to share</a>". And we do it three ways:</p>
<p />
<ol>
<li>Build trust with your community. At wikiHow we do this via open content licensing and building and distributing our open source software.</li>
<li>Build software which enables sharing and collaboration. A common example of this is to have tools to allow others to easily republish content on other sites.</li>
<li>Walk the walk. Be accessible to your community and practice the behavior of sharing, openness that you want your community to adopt.</li>
</ol>
