<p>The <a href="http://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a> has released three million records from the British National Bibliography into the public domain using the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 public domain waiver</a>. The <a href="http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/natbib.html">British National Bibliography</a> contains data on publishing activity from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland since 1950. JISC OpenBibliography has made this set downloadable at <a href="http://ckan.net/package/jiscopenbib-bl_bnb-1">CKAN</a>; in addition, the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/BritishLibraryRdf">Internet Archive</a> also offers the data for download.</p>
<p>This is a tremendous move on behalf of the British Library and the JISC OpenBibliography project, and we would like to congratulate them on their contributions to open data. From the <a href="http://openbiblio.net/">JISC OpenBibliography project blog</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Agreements such as these are crucial to our community, as developments in areas such as Linked Data are only beneficial when there is content on which to operate. We look forward to announcing further releases and developments, and to being part of a community dedicated to the future of open scholarship."</p></blockquote>
