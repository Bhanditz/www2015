<p><a href="http://davidbyrne.com/tour_journal_04.php">David Byrne's tour journal</a> now has an entry for last week's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4415">WIRED concert</a> and Creative Commons benefit.  Byrne on the songs he and Gilberto Gil played together:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Over the last few weeks I've been E-mailing his people regarding the possibilities of us doing a song or 2 together. We've exchanged ideas and MP3s via Email, as we only have the afternoon soundcheck to rehearse together. It's been kind of crazy, but it works.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ever wonder what a rock star does after the after-concert party?</p>
<blockquote><p>
I ride my bicycle home - It might be around 3AM.
