<p>I'll be at the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/worldwide/au/">Creative Commons Australia</a> launch next week at the <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au/">Queensland University of Technology</a>, as well as making brief visits to Melbourne and Sydney. I'd love to visit with any organizations or groups interested in Creative Commons while I'm there. <a href="mailto:info@creativecommons.org">Drop me a line</a> if you're around and would like to discuss Creative Commons in Australia.</p>
