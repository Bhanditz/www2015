<p><a href="http://www.freesound.org/">Freesound</a>, a venerable repository of CC-licensed samples, has been up to a bevy of good work since <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8123">we last checked in</a> with them. This includes developing a <a href="http://www.freesound.org/blog/?p=10">beautiful successor</a> to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wav2png/">wav2png</a>, changing their name to <em><a href="http://www.freesound.org/blog/?p=14">freesound.org</a></em>, <a href="http://www.freesound.org/blog/?p=16">teaming up</a> with <a href="http://www.happynewears.be/2008/en/index.html">Happy New Ears</a> to develop an interactive sample machine aimed at children, and <a href="http://www.freesound.org/blog/?p=18">launching Freesound Radio</a>, an "experimental web-based system around collaboration and social interaction in sample based music creations."</p>
<p>What many people don't realize about Freesound.org is that it is an initiative of the <a href="http://mtg.upf.edu/">Music Technology Group</a> at <a href="http://www.upf.edu/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a> in Barcelona. This means that outside of Freesound there are a collection of amazing students and professors working on understanding how music technology is changing at a rapid pace. One of these student, Jordi Janer, recentlly released his PHD <em><a href="http://www.mtg.upf.edu/~jjaner/phd/">singing-driven interfaces for sound synthesizers</a></em> as a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> licensed <a href="http://www.mtg.upf.edu/~jjaner/phd/Tesi_jjaner_online.pdf">PDF download</a>.</p>
