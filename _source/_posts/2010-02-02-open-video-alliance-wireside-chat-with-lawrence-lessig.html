<p><img src="img/redbadge3.png" alt="" title="redbadge3" width="250" height="272" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />On Febuary 25th the <a href="http://openvideoalliance.org/">Open Video Alliance</a> will be hosting a <a href="http://openvideoalliance.org/event/lessig/">wireside chat</a> with CC founding board member <a href="http://lessig.org/">Lawrence Lessig</a> to discuss copyright, fair use, and online video. While the talk itself will be taking place at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School, it will also be broadcast live online - as such, the OVA are <a href="http://openvideoalliance.org/event/lessig/">encouraging screenings to be set up</a> around the globe:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a talk about copyright in a digital age, and the role (and importance) of a doctrine like â€œfair use.â€ Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders, and is essential for commentary, criticism, news reporting, remix, research, teaching and scholarship with video.</p>
<p>As a medium, online video will be most powerful when it is fluid, like a conversation. Like the rest of the internet, online video must be designed to encourage participation, not just passive consumption. Tune in here on February 25th, 6:00pm US Eastern time (GMT -5), or check out our screening events in cities across the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Events are already planned for New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles with more in the works in  Washington DC, Austin, Toronto and Rio de Janeiro. If you are interested in hosting your own, head to the OVA website where you can<a href="http://openvideoalliance.org/event/lessig-registration/"> fill out a registration form and apply for a microgrant</a> to help get your event off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The Wireside Chat is being co-hosted by <a href="http://icommons.org/">iCommons Ltd</a> with funding from the <a href="http://www.fordfound.org/">Ford Foundation</a>.</p>
