<p>From the<a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2008/05/01/rockefeller-university-press-adopts-cc-licenses/"> Science Commons blog</a>, <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/nguyen/">Thinh Nguyen</a> on Rockefeller University Press' recent announcement:</p>
<p style="30px;">"Leading by example, the Rockefeller University Press has issued a <a href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804037">bold challenge</a> to other non-OA publishers to find new ways to strike a balance between sustainable publishing and advancing authorsâ€™ freedoms and the public interest. The Press adopted a <a href="http://www.jcb.org/misc/terms.shtml">new copyright policy</a> that returns essential freedoms to authors and extends permissions to the public that are vital to advancing science. This new policy covers its journals, which include the prestigious <a href="http://www.jcb.org/">Journal of Cell Biology</a>, <a href="http://www.jem.org/">The Journal of Experimental Medicine</a> and <a href="http://www.jgp.org/">The Journal of General Physiology</a>.</p>
<p style="30px;">Under the policy, there are two license periods. An initial license, available during the first six month period after publication, permits sharing and reuse of the work, but prohibits distribution through mirror sites (whether commercial or non-commercial). After this six months, the Press grants the public a standard <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License</a>. These two licenses differ only in the mirroring prohibition clause â€” otherwise, the conditions are essentially similar. [...]"</p>
