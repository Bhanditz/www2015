<p>University College Cork will lead the license translation and work to expand global access to Irish culture.</p>
<p><strong>Palo Alto, USA, and Cork, Ireland</strong> &mdash; Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative works free for copying and re-use, announced today the expansion of its International Commons (iCommons) project to Ireland.  University College Cork (UCC) will lead the effort.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to have University College Cork lead iCommons in Ireland," said Lawrence Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford. "Their participation is crucial to our growing effort to promote an international cultural commons."</p>
<p>"We look forward to cooperating with the Creative Commons project," said Dr. Darius Whelan, project lead of iCommons in Ireland and Lecturer in Law at University College Cork Law Faculty. "This way we will enable creators of original works to disseminate that work widely through the Internet for the benefit of everyone," said Louise Crowly co-project lead of iCommons in Ireland and Lecturer in Law at University College Cork Law Faculty.</p>
<p>Announced in March 2003, iCommons is Creative Commons' project to make its machine-readable copyright licenses useful worldwide. As the lead institution, UCC will coordinate a public effort to adapt the Creative Commons licenses for use in Ireland.  UCC will field comments on an archived email discussion at the Creative Commons website <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#ireland">http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#ireland</a>.</p>
<p>Ireland joins Brazil, Japan, Finland, China, and Taiwan in the iCommons effort.</p>
