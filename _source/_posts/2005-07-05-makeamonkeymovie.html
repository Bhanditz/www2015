<p>Free software hacker and entrepreneur Nat Friedman <a href="http://nat.org/2005/july/#Scopes-trial-reenactment/BBQ">staged a reenactment</a> of the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial">Scopes "Monkey" Trial</a> and published the <a href="http://nat.org/scopes.txt">script</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License</a>.</p>
<p>Stage your own reenactment/BBQ, make it into a film, make a cartoon based on the script with Darrow and Bryan as monkeys debating whether it is ok to teach that monkeys descended from mostly hairless apes...</p>
