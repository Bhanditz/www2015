<p>Last week we <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26856">asked you</a> to help support the Japanese relief effort. We would also like to highlight alternative ways you can help by pointing you to a few relief efforts that are using CC licenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliveinenglish/"><img src="img/OLIVE-logo.jpg" alt="" title="OLIVE logo" width="200" height="71" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-26884" /></a><strong>OLIVE for quake survivors</strong><br />
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliveinenglish/">OLIVE</a> is a Wikipedia-like site that provides much-needed information for quake survivors in various languages. With thousands of people displaced from their homes in Japan, many are surviving in make-shift homes and shelters, with scant resources. OLIVE provides practical and creative ways on how to best utilize available resources, such as how to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliveinenglish/shokki/sara/sara">make a dish from a plastic bottle</a> or <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliveinenglish/shokki/sara/akikan-kara-koppu-wo-tsukuru-houhou">empty can</a>, how to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliveinenglish/dan-wo-toru/newspaper">preserve body heat with polystyrene or newspaper</a>, and how to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliveinenglish/dan-wo-toru/stay-warm-in-cardboard-house">stay warm in cardboard house</a>. You can help by contributing articles to OLIVE or translating existing articles--all of which are under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Music compilations where 100% of proceeds are donated to Red Cross and other charities</strong><br />
Two projects are calling for net musicians to submit their music, graphic design, video, and photography for compilations where all proceeds will be donated to charitable organizations helping Japan, like the Red Cross. <a href="http://internetlabelcompilation.blogspot.com/2011/03/call-to-netlabels-netmusicians-and.html">InternetLabel</a> is calling for music submissions by April 1st and for art submissions by April 11. The InternetLabel compilation will be released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> license. <a href="http://www.impurfekt.com/news/Entries/2011/3/12_music_for_the_rising_sun_%28the_japan_relief_compilation%29.html">Impurfekt</a>, which is focusing specifically on art influenced by Japanese culture, is calling for submissions by April 15. The Impurfekt compilation will be released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license. </p>
<p><strong>Architecture for Humanity</strong><br />
Architecture for Humanity, a strong supporter of CC license use in its <a href="http://openarchitecturenetwork.org/licensing">Open Architecture Network</a> and for crisis recovery centers for <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/updates/2010-02-18-haiti-quake-a-plan-for-reconstruction">Haiti</a> and <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/projects/biloxi_model_homes">New Orleans</a>, is <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/programs/2011-sendai-earthquake-and-tsunami">asking for support for similar reconstruction building efforts in Japan</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sinsai.info/ushahidi/"><img src="img/Sinsai-logo.png" alt="" title="Sinsai logo" width="200" height="61" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-26889" /></a><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong><br />
OpenStreetMap set up a disaster information sharing site at <a href="http://www.sinsai.info/ushahidi/">www.sinsai.info</a> in Japanese, in addition to an <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2011_Sendai_earthquake_and_tsunami">English landing page</a> for the disaster where you can contribute to improving map data for Japan. Like all its data, OpenStreetMap's <a href="http://labs.geofabrik.de/japan/">data set for the Sendai region</a> is available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Google Person Finder</strong><br />
Although it doesn't use CC, the Google Person Finder is an open source Google app that was developed in response to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20216">Haiti earthquake</a> and that has been adapted for the missing person database for Japan. You can use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlepersonfinder/ ">Google Person Finder </a>to search for loved ones, and find out more about how it works <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlepersonfinder/wiki/FAQ">here</a>. </p>
