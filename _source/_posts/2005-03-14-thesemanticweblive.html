<p>Our very own Mike Linksvayer and Matt Haughey are on a panel at <a href="http://sxsw.com">SXSW</a> discussing metadata, the semantic web, and the one-of-a-kind Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/find/">search engine</a> at this very moment. If you're at the Austin Convention Center, get over here to Room 15.</p>
