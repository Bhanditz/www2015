<p><a href="http://www.freddiestevenson.com/">Freddie Stevenson</a>, a British singer-songwriter, recently unveiled his new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-My-Strange-Companions/dp/B0013SGWBY?tag=particculturf-20"><em>All My Strange Companions</em></a> to some <a href="http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936577.html?categoryid=34&amp;cs=1">nice</a> <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/popcandy/2008/04/podcast-chill-w.html">praise</a> <a href="http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=video&amp;id=sxsw&amp;bclid=1434034406&amp;bctid=1457712538">stateside</a>. Released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">BY-NC-SA license</a>, <em>All My Strange Companions</em> features melodic, acoustic-based, pop that is sharable/remixable as long as Stevenson is credited, it is noncommercial in intenet, and is released under the same license if altered.</p>
<p>Stevenson acts similarly web savvy in his coining of the term "Blong" which, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Stevenson">according to Wikipedia</a>, are "short, spontaneous songs written and recorded like a blog entry, that are then posted to his online blogs along with their accompanying lyrics". Head to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/freddiestevenson">his MySpace</a> to check them out.</p>
