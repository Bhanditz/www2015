<p>A meeting of the Creative Commons Board of Directors was held on 22-23 September 2012 at MIT in Cambridge, MA hosted by Media Lab Director (and CC Chairman) Joi Ito.</p>
<p>The Directors received an update on 4.0 license revisions and a report from the Audit Committee on the FY 2011 audit. A budget for 2013 was presented, as were fundraising projections through 2014.  The Board passed a resolution honoring former CC VP Mike Linksvayer for his outstanding contributions to the organization. </p>
<p>The Directors considered how CC could best implement its mission in the future and reviewed a strategic plan.  Project proposals in the areas of educational publishing, policy organizations, open licensing courseware and big data were also discussed.  The Board expressed its desire to incorporate technical innovation as the bedrock of all program activities and to focus more resources on development of innovative technical capabilities that would encourage the use of CC licenses in todayâ€™s platforms and digital devices.  Additional appointments to the Board were also proposed.</p>
