<p><a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/">Scott Andrew Lepera</a>, previously <a href="http://creativecommons.org/audio/musicians">featured</a> in our Audio section a couple years back, has <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/main/entries/001148">a great post today looking at the benefits and costs of filesharing</a> to a small, independent artist. He weighs the pros and cons of both filesharing and digital rights management (DRM), and comes to a different conclusion than he once held. It's interesting stuff that a lot of other net-based musicians can likely relate to.</p>
