<p>
<a href="http://www.projectgramophone.org/">Project Gramophone</a> is a new project that aims to become a definitive source for early recordings that slipped into the public domain. The goals are similar to <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a>, but with audio instead of text. For now, the project features <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/project-gramophone/">a mailing list</a> open to anyone interested in contributing to the project.</p>
