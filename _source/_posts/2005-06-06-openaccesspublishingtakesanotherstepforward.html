<p>Science Commons - a new project of Creative Commons that works to encourage sharing of scientific and academic knowledge - has launched an Open Access Law Program. The Program is designed to make legal scholarship "open access," that is freely available online to everyone, without undue copyright and licensing restrictions. The Program involves an Open Access Law Author Pledge, Open Access Law Principles and an Open Access Law Model Publication Agreement.</p.
<p>Our very own Chairman & CEO, Lawrence Lessig, is one of the first signatories to the Open Access Law Author Pledge.  In addition, 21 important law reviews have adopted the Open Access Principles, or have policies that are consistent with them. Leading journals like such as Michigan Law Review, Animal Law, Harvard Journal of Law & Technology, Indiana Law Journal, Lewis & Clark Law Review, Michigan Law Review, Michigan State Law Review and, New York Law School Law Review, Texas Law Review, Vanderbilt Law Review, and Wayne Law Review  and Michigan State Law Review have signed on, as have all of the journals published by Duke Law School and Villanova Law School.  More information about the Program is available at the <a href="http://science.creativecommons.org/literature/oalaw">Science Commons Program page</a>. The Program is one part of the Science Commons Publishing Project, which is working to support open access to scholarly research in a wide range of disciplines including agriculture, entomology, biology, anthropology and now law.</p></p>
