<p>Today, the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research">issued a Directive</a> supporting public access to publicly-funded research. </p>
<p>John Holdren, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, "has directed Federal agencies with more than $100M in R&D expenditures to develop plans to make the published results of federally funded research freely available to the public within one year of publication and requiring researchers to better account for and manage the digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research."</p>
<p>Each agency covered by the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf">Directive</a> (54 KB PDF) must "Ensure that the public can read, download, and analyze in digital form final peer reviewed manuscripts or final published documents within a timeframe that is appropriate for each type of research conducted or sponsored by the agency."</p>
<p>The Directive comes out after a multi-year campaign organized by Open Access advocates, and reflects a groundswell of <a href="/weblog/entry/32727">grassroots support</a> for public access to the scientific research that the public pays for. Of course, the White House Directive is issued on the heels of the <a href="/weblog/entry/36699">introduction</a> of the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR). Both the Directive and the FASTR legislation are <a href="https://plus.google.com/109377556796183035206/posts/8hzviMJeVHJ">complementary approaches</a> to ensuring that the public can access and use the scientific research it pays for. </p>
<p>We applaud this important policy Directive. While the Directive and FASTR do not specifically require the application of open licenses to the scientific research outputs funded with federal tax dollars, both actions represent crucial steps toward increasing public access to research.</p>
