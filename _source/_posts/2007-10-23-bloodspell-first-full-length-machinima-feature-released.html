<p><a href="http://www.bloodspell.com">Bloodspell</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima">machinima</a> film project <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7093">we mentioned last November</a>, has been released as an 84 minute feature. This is a first feature length machinima production, and it's released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> license:</p>
<blockquote><p>We`re fairly sure BloodSpell is the largest Machinima film ever created. It`s an independent film that, because it is using Machinima technology, isn`t subject to the usual limitations of smaller films. But, at the same time, we don`t have the politics, money and producers of a Hollywood production involved, so we can experiment with ideas, styles and attitudes that wouldn`t be possible in a more top-heavy Hollywood production.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have some limitations, and BloodSpell won`t be beating out `Lord of the Rings` for visual effects. But we hope that what we lack in slick polish, we can make up for in originality and passion.</p>
<p>The other unique thing about BloodSpell is the way it`s being released. We will be releasing BloodSpell under a <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license, meaning that it will be free both to download and to modify: in other words, where even many indie filmmakers might get upset if you put their work up on Bittorrent or translate it into a new language, we`ll be encouraging work like that, and supporting it as much as possible.</p></blockquote>
