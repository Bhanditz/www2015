<p>Over at the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2008/04/02/voices-from-the-future-of-science/">blog</a>, an introduction and a call for suggestions / comments ...</p>
<blockquote><p>"Over the past few months, you may have noticed that some of the posts here have been attributed to a mysterious "dwentworth." That's me -- <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/wentworth/" title="Donna Wentworth">Donna Wentworth</a> -- and I'm here to start bringing more of your voices to the Science Commons blog. [...]</p>
<p>Here's where you come in. If you're reading this blog, chances are you're <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?cat=4" title="passionate">passionate</a> about the <a href="http://www.nature.com/scifoo/" title="future of science">future of science</a>. You may even be a part of the vast, incredibly diverse community of people that actually make science happen: <a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/" title="scientists">scientists</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/index.html" title="publishers">publishers</a>, research <a href="http://www.mlnm.com/" title="company">company</a> representatives, research <a href="http://www.alsa.org/" title="foundation">foundation</a> officers, <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/" title="computer scientists">computer scientists</a>, <a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/" title="entrepreneurs">entrepreneurs</a>, <a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/" title="librarians">librarians</a> and more. Some of you may be <a href="http://www.plausibleaccuracy.com/blog/" title="bloggers">bloggers</a> yourselves, who track developments in your area of science and ended up at Science Commons once or twice.</p>
<p>My hope is that you'll join me in turning up the volume on the conversation surrounding open science. As part of this effort, I'm going to start profiling individuals and organizations working to open new frontiers for innovation and discovery in science. I am also building a community blog roll -- or a public aggregator, if that works better -- for open science. The goal isn't to endorse particular viewpoints or blogs, but instead to showcase the work that's already being done to midwife a new way of sharing and building scientific knowledge, as well as to start identifying ways we can all work together.
