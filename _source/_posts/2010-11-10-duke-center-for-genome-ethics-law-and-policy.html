<p><strong>Can you give our readers some background on the Center for Genome Ethics, Law, and Policy? What is your role there?</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Genome Ethics, Law & Policy is a component of Duke's Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy.  The idea of the Institute is to house interdisciplinary research and scholarship.  At Duke, an Insittute is a unit that involves mulitple schools and departments, but is not one itself.  Our center's job within the Institute is to focus on ethical issues that arise in either doing or applying genomics, and on the legal questions that arise and on the social implications.  </p>
<p>The evils and benefits of patenting have been hotly debated since before there was a Human Genome Project, and you may have noticed that we haven't exactly reached a consensus.  (Just this week, we've entered an amicus curiae brief on the case being appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit about BRCA patents; and that case won't be over for some time.)</p>
<p>Our most distinctive research focus has been in intellectual property and its absence.  Genomics is quite unusual in having explicit rules about sharing data and materials.  The whole field grew up post-Bayh-Dole and has always involved lots of fancy new instruments and had implications for medicine in areas where private R&D is at least as important as basic research.  We decided early on that experts like Arti Rai, James Boyle and Jerry Reichman at Duke's Law School, and folks like Wes Cohen, Tracy Lewis, and Ashish Arora at our Fuqua School of Business, gave us some comparative advantage in that area of research, so we applied for a grant to create the Center for Public Genomics, and we lucked out in getting it funded at just the time we were growing and defining ourselves.  </p>

<p><strong>What is the link between GELP and CC? Do you all use our tools in your various projects?</strong></p>
<p>The links are people and ideas.  Creative Commons was just starting Science Commons at the same time GELP was born.  We grew up together and played together in the school of hard knocks.  John Wilbanks and CC staff came to our meetings.  James Boyle and Arti Rai have been involved heavily in Creative Commons and Science Commons.  Jerry Reichman has been trying to help create a Microbial Commons.  You could say we have lots of people in Commons.</p>
<p>Spiritually, we are in complete alignment with the goals of Creative Commons and Science Commons.  Genomics as a field is completely and utterly dependent on a healthy mutualism between discovery science and practical application, and thus academic research and private R&D.  I wake up every morning worrying about how to share data and materials, and finding ways to respect copyright and patent rights but not letting them impede research and its application.  Indeed the whole point of those rights to exclude is to foster creativity in our culture and innovation in industry.  Yet the fields are rife with conflict and deeply held ideologies, but rarely fertilized with empirical facts.  Our job at GELP, and the Center for Public Genomics, is to study things and find some facts and interpret them.  CC and Science Commons are all about finding solutions that reduce friction in the IP system and in sharing of data and materials. So our roles are complementary and mutually dependent.</p>
<p><strong>GELP is a corporate sponsor of Creative Commons - what was the motivation behind this generous giving? What is it about CC that you find important?</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons and Science Commons are key nodes in a complex web of people and institutions.  We are another node.  CC and SC are unique. We are not; we are more dispensable, because there are many academic centers with talent.  But there is only one place that is trying to actually get things done, and doing so as a trusted nonprofit intermediary and catalyst:  Science Commons.  When we do research, we publish it, but we are just not as good at putting things into action.  And I love my university and being an academic, but I don't expect to save the world from Duke.  I'm reminded of the epitaph on Buffy the Vampire Slayer's grave:  "She Saved the World.  A Lot."  That's what CC has begun to do in the world of art and writing, it's helping save our culture from some of its own worst pathologies; and what SC has the potential to do in science.</p>

How does CC enable GELP to better innovate in that space?</strong></p>
<p>Our field of genomics is poised for takeoff.  This is not pure hype.  In 1999 there was no published human genome; by 2003 we had a reference human genome; by 2007 Craig Venter and Jim Watson's genomes were on the Internet.  In 2010, Nature estimates that several thousand people have been fully sequenced, and that will be a log bigger.  That is, we're in a log per year lift-off of information creation.  It's big.</p>
<p>But here's the deal.  That information is useless--I mean totallly useless--if it is not compared to sequences of other people and other organisms.  What matters is genetic variation and how that maps to phenotype (the things we can observe about people, like whether they get a disease or prone to this risk or that).  If there was ever a field that depended on network dynamics, this is surely one.  That means the value of information depends on sharing and cumulative networked analysis.  I know for sure I can't predict who will make the most valuable contributions to understanding my genome, but I sure want them to do a good job.  And they can only do a good job if they have access to lots of other peoples' genomes.  And those people have the concerns for privacy, fears of abuse, and distrust of institutions that I do.</p>
<p>How in the world are we going to solve this problem?  Well, I don't know.  But I do know it's not going well because research institutions and private firms are already a big grabby because of their incentives, and their foremost concern is not to share and create value collectively but to mine what's under their control already.  Our policies are drifting towards institutional control whereas the real value of genomic data is going to require information vastly beyond the scope of control of any institution.</p>
<p>Surely part of the solution is going to be institutions that are trusted intermediaries among institutions, and to be trusted they will have to be nonprofit. But they can't be hostile to profit and those seeking it.  We need Science Commons because it can be one of the new institutions we need to enable the dangerous dark innovation jungle to thrive despite the entrenched ideologies and conflicting interests of all the critters that live in it.  We're depending on you.  May The Force be with you.</p>
