<p>I'm always amazed at how far the power of invention mixed with a determination to realize your idea on a large scale can take you. That's why the new PBS one hour television series about the people who are shaping technology and the Silicon Valley landscape seems so interesting. PBS will be launching NerdTV, the first downloadable, web-exclusive series, beginning Sept. 6th. You can check it out <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/">here.</a> NerdTV viewers are encouraged to download and copy the shows, share them with friends and even post them on their own Web sites - all legally.</p>
