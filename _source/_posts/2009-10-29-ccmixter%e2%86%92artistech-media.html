<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org"><img src="img/cc-mixter-sq-logo.png" style="border:none;float:right;padding:5px" alt="ccMixter" /></a> Only 5 years ago the benefits of CC-enabled remix -- fully legal, easy, and respectful of both original artists,  remixers, and fans (but not necessarily of those less and less useful strict divisions) -- was mostly a vision, unrealized potential. ccMixter played a big part in changing that, beginning with its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5036">launch featuring tracks from the WIRED CD</a> -- the Gilberto Gil, David Byrne, the Beastie Boys, et al.</p>
<p>Since then, ccMixter has hosted remix contests and challenges from many top artists (check out <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18276">DJ Vadim Remixes You</a>, wrapping up next week). Many other music remix sites supporting CC licensing and garnering cool contests have also sprung up -- seeing the potential of web-mediated, fully legal remix requires no imagination at this point -- though there's still a long way to go to realize its potential to change culture. However, the real strength of ccMixter (and a far leading indicator of cultural change on the horizon) is the ccMixter community and the many years of distributed yet very friendly collaboration embodied in that community. If reading is your thing, check out site admin/developer/mentor Victor Stone's <a href="http://fourstones.net/ccmixter-a-memoir">ccMixter memoir</a> for a deep account of ccMixter's nature, contributions, and lessons.</p>
<p>For some time CC has been <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7833">thinking about</a> how to take ccMixter to the next level and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8492">looking for</a> just the right entity to do that.</p>
<p>Now, we're very happy to announce that <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/2059">ccMixter will henceforth be run by ArtisTech Media</a>. For details, see the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/2060">transfer FAQ</a>, <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/2061">Victor Stone's take</a>, and <a href="http://ccmixter.org/thread/2061#77070">letter from Emily Richards, the CEO of ArtisTech Media</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>I love ccMixter - exactly as it is. In all my years in music and tech, Iâ€™ve found ccMixterâ€™s community to be the most positive, cohesive, and collaborative Iâ€™ve been a part of. The music collectively created at ccMixter is uniquely powerful, because of this amazing community of talented, visionary artists. Our goal at ArtisTech is to continue to help foster this talent and community as it grows. And for those seeking even more opportunity for their art, well, our aim is to help you find ways to share your music with the world, without disturbing the balance of this beautiful musical jewel we all love (ccMixter.org).</p>
<p>As the old saying goes â€˜if it ainâ€™t broken, donâ€™t fix itâ€™ so we see no need to change things. We may add capacity to allow for larger file uploads and perhaps other improvements of a similar nature, but ccMixter belongs to all of us and it works so magically right now, as it is.</p>
<p>I first uploaded tracks to ccMixter in October 2006, based on the recommendation of ArtisTech co-founder, Jason Brock (spinningmerkaba). When I listened to my first group of remixes (by norelpref, Hundred Schools of Thought, Briareus and PorchCat) I knew Iâ€™d been lucky enough to stumble upon something extraordinary. More than three years later, I am more amazed by ccMixter than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longstanding participation of Emily (known as <a href="http://ccmixter.org/people/snowflake">Snowflake</a> on ccMixter) and others in the ArtisTech team in the community was a huge plus -- adding to the team's great mix of business, music, and technology experience, and their great spirit and respectfulness.</p>
<p>So CC is really excited about this transition. We believe that in ArtisTech Media we've found just the right entity to take ccMixter to the next level, but only with maximum respect for the community and adherence to the forms of openness that have enabled the site and community so far.</p>
<p>If you're already involved in the ccMixter community, we hope that after reading the FAQ and posts from Victor and Emily you'll be convinced the long search was worthwhile and that you're very excited to participate in ccMixter's next step. If you're not involved yet -- <a href="http://ccmixter.org">check out the site!</a></p>
<p><b>p.s.</b> A huge THANK YOU to all who have helped make this transition possible over the past year, in particular <a href="http://www.wsgr.com">Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati</a> for pro bono legal help, and CC's General Counsel, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#95">Diane Peters</a>.</p>
