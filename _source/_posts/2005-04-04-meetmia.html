<p>One bit of joy amidst the sadness of leaving Creative Commons is the opportunity to introduce you to Mia Garlick, our new General Counsel. Mia is an IP expert who just recently came to CC from the Silicon Valley branch of the top-notch law firm Simpson Thatcher and Barlett, which she joined after getting her LLM from Stanford (specializing in Law, Science, and Technology). Before coming to the States, Mia had a far-ranging and powerful IP and media law practice in Australia, her home. I've gotten to work with Mia over the last two weeks and am wildly excited both for the staff and for her, as the great CC experiment continues to expand. Mia's strengths in media, international law, and science fit the organization's future needs to a T, and her quick wit and energy will make her a blast to work with, inside CC and out. Congrats and best wishes to you, Mia!</p>
