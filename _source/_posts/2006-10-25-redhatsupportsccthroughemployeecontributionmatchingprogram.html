<p><a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a> recently launched a matching sponsorship program for their employees in order to continue their support of Creative Commons. They will match their employees' donations dollar for dollar up to $5,000.</p>
<p>We'd like to extend a warm thanks to our friends at <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a> for their continued support -- we are very appreciative!</p>
<p>If any other companies are interested in participating in our matching sponsorship program, please contact melissa@creativecommons.org.</p>
