<p><a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS9978560959.html">Great</a> news coming out recently that our good friends over at the awesome open source mobile phone project <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/index.html">OpenMoko</a> have been seeing rapid success with releasing their <a href="http://www.openmoko.com/download-cad.html">CAD design files</a> for the FreeRunner phone under the Creative Commons Share-Alike license. Their open design approach has spurred adoption, becoming the basis for the <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3503273639.html">Dash Express car navigation device</a>, and a popular platform for other projects such as the Debian-based <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS2955814405.html">WEphone</a>. It's gaining a lot of traction, and it looks like we'll be able to look forward to even more successes on the open design front in the near future. Might have to pick one up for <a href="http://www.fabulousbitches.org">myself</a>...</p>
<p>This follows in the line of similar recent adoption successes seen by other businesses taking the strategy of making their CAD files open to the public like the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8401">award-winning</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8320">OpenBook project</a> that makes designs for their laptop available for anyone to use. We're hoping that these examples set the stage for companies to take up the business opportunities available in CCing their product schematics.</p>
