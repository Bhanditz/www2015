<p>Earlier this month <a href="http://revver.com">Revver</a> announced that it had <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/12/revver-1-million-in-user-payouts-12-months/">paid $1 million to video creators and promoters over the past year.</a> Revver has been a pioneer in combining CC licensing (videos on Revver are licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives</a>) and compensation to creators via an ad-based model. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6125">Creative Commons used Revver</a> as part of its fall fundraising campaign last year (watch <em><a href="http://one.revver.com/watch/89072">Wanna Work Together</a></em>).</p>
<p>Congratulations to the video creators and promoters on Revver, and to Revver!</p>
<p><a href="http://blip.tv">Blip.tv</a> and <a href="http://lulu.tv">Lulu.tv</a> are two other video sites combining CC licensing (Blip.tv supports any CC license; Lulu.tv, like Revver, only uses BY-NC-ND) and user payouts.</p>
