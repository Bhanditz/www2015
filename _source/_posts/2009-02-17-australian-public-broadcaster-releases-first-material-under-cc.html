<p>From <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/node/211">CC Australia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A couple of days ago the [Australian Broadcasting Corporation's] excellent collaborative media site, Pool, posted a recording of <a href="http://www.pool.org.au/audio/pool_team/steve_jones_on_chales_darwin_interviewed_on_abc_rns_life_matters">genetics professor Steve Jones talking about Darwinâ€™s life and work</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial licence</a>. As far as we're aware, this is the very first time material from the ABC archives has been released under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning. <a href="http://pool.org.au/blog/pool_team/gene_pool_launch_and_open_archives_release">Pool</a> plans to release a whole series of ABC archival materials for remixing as part of its its Gene Pool project.</p>
<p>We're all very excited here at CCau. The ABC has, almost without question, the largest historical audiovisual archive in Australia. Just think what we can do with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>We're excited as well. Last year we conducted a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7987">round-up</a> of broadcasters implementing CC, and twelve months later, with exemplary license usage by <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazeera</a> and now ABC's Pool project, it seems the broadcasting world is poised for more. Stay tuned and enjoy exploring the remixable, high-quality material.</p>
