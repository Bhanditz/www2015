The show is broadcast across Italy, meaning that around 130 CC-licensed tracks will be played on Italian National TV throughout the show's tenure. </p>
<p>Beatpick is also providing its CC-licensed music catalog for productions posted to <a href="http://www.ustation.it/">Ustation</a>, Universication's online hub for user-generated video. These productions will take advantage of the free and open terms allowed by our licenses, giving student filmmakers an opportunity to use music within their productions legally. </p>
<p>Many of these videos will be broadcast on TV - by utilizing Beatpick's catalog throughout Umedia have streamlined the process, allowing content to flow easily from non-commercial to commercial venues.</p>
