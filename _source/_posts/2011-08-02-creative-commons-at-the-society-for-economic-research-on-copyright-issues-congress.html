<p>Last month, CC participated in the yearly <a href="http://www.serci.org/congress/programme_2011.htm">SERCI congress</a>, which took place in Bilbao, Spain. SERCI is the Society for Economic Research on Copyright Issues. The SERCI congress is therefore intended to allow researchers to discuss their ongoing work with their peers and to further academic alliances between them for the benefit of future research enterprises. We were only able to participate following a rigorous process in which our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/1/12/SERCI_2011_accepted_paper_-_Tal_Niv.pdf">research outputs</a> were refereed. </p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of the people we were fortunate to meet at SERCI and how interesting and critically important their research is, attending was Nancy Gallini (University of British Colombia), who was discussing antitrust implications of copyright bundles, such as the ones arguably created by collecting societies. Participating was also Michael Yuan (Roger Williams University) who was discussing a paper he wrote along with Koji Domon (Waseda University) presenting their research comparing between copyright systems of â€œIndefinitely Renewable Copyrightâ€ and the current system. Christian Handke (Erasmus University of Rotterdam) spoke about Copyright and its â€œEffects on Different Types of Innovationâ€, and Jin-Hyuk Kim (the University of Cambridge) was discussing his work on copyright levies. These participants were just part of a very long list of prominent researchers from all over the world, and the person orchestrating it all was Richard Watt from the University of Canterbury.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell from the titles of the papers, we were delighted to find at the congress academics highly involved in research directly intended to impact global, international and national copyright policy! That, as well as the quality of their input, is why they have the ear of policy makers and this is why they are right up our alley! </p>
<p>So to serve as an example for how high the level of involvement of these academics in policy-making circles reaches, at SERCI we met economists who work for governmental authorities such as Benjamin Mitra-Kahn (UK Intellectual Property Office), Dimiter Gantchev (WIPO) and Raphael Solomon (Copyright Board of Canada). Benjamin was speaking about the Hargreaves report, which is a review of Intellectual Property and Growth, initiated in November 2010 by Englandâ€™s Prime Minister, David Cameron, conducted by Prof. Ian Hargreaves. And Dimiter Gantchev was discussing the recent discussions ongoing in WIPO about global copyright registries.</p>
<p>I believe I can objectively report that the level of interest from participants in Creative Commons was very high. And our own topic for discussion can be essentially described as ourselves: <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/b/b7/SERCI_2011_presentation_-_Tal_Niv.pdf">Our presentation</a> was about our ongoing project about CCâ€™s economic contribution (see especially <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/23504" title="Introducing a series of posts investigating CCâ€™s welfareÂ impact">first</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24216" title="Investigating CCâ€™s Welfare Impact: Quantity, Quality and VariabilityÂ Measures">fourth</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/24710" title="CCâ€™s Contribution to Welfare, Field-by-Field: The Separate Contribution to Collaboration &amp;Â Sharing">fifth</a> posts about the project, and of course, <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/1/12/SERCI_2011_accepted_paper_-_Tal_Niv.pdf">the paper itself</a>). Several good results came from our participation:</p>
<p>First, we were able to arouse a lot of interest among this global community of researchers, and boy, did we cherish the attention! For instance, people were asking how CC is impacting the copyright environment that applies to its different communities, how exactly the process of applying the license works, how CC analyzes its usersâ€™ incentives, etc.</p>
<p>Everybody who was there now knows what we do and how important we are in the space of spurring the operation of our different communities (through enhanced sharing and transactional benefits). Obviously, this newly acquired knowledge about CC is bound to be shared with researchers in the respective institutions of the participants, thus percolating through the community of scholars and increasing our renown, as an organization and as a platform. </p>
<p>The critically important implication of all this is that when these scholars are voicing their opinions in policy-making circles, it is highly probable that they will now be offering CC as potential solution for different problems that hinder the activity within our target communities, of creators, scientists, educators, governments, NGOs, individual data contributors, etc. </p>
<p>Second, we were able to receive substantial advice on the project we came in to present. For instance, we discussed with the other participants the decisions we have made to look at our contribution in different CC communities separately and only then at cross-influences, our understanding of our user incentives and our ability to substantially reduce transaction costs, as well as our suggested formulation of how the sharing and collaboration we promote benefits welfare and individuals. </p>
<p>Third, we struck bonds with some new studious friends â€“ and CC now has more colleagues within the research community. This means that we can count on collaborations for CC-oriented research, which we are conducting, and also that we can expect others to initiate and conduct independent research on CC themes. </p>
<p>To make a long story short, SERCI has been what was expected and more, and we are already looking forward to implementing what weâ€™ve learned, to start our cooperation with the scholars we met and to make plans for our next such event! </p>
<p><small>Note: The SERCI Congress program which is linked to is not updated. We are told by SERCI that it will be, to include the names of all the participants in the coming days.</small></p>
