<p>Annalee Newitz has <a href="http://www.alternet.org/columnists/story/19164/">a great article in Alternet about Mash-ups</a>, going over the copyright laws involved and how the laws are viewed in the mash-up scene. It's an interested clash, where restrictive laws loom over digital musicians armed with low-cost computers and software that makes mixing easy. In this realm, Newitz sees mash-ups as a form of protest, where DJs knowingly violate laws in order to spread their art in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>
As a masher on [Get Your Bootleg On] recently posted, "Everything is illegal." Under an I.P. regime where artists feel like nothing goes, it seems that everything could. The infringement generation aims to mash up copyright law in pursuit of better music. But it also has a chance to challenge social divisions more profound than the distinctions between hip-hop, rock and electroclash.
