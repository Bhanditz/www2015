<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>, creator of the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FrontPage">first wiki</a>, interviewed in <a href="http://www.adtmag.com/article.aspx?id=19057">Application Development Trends</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Creative Commons Attribution license is the "technology" we need to save patterns. If we'd known this 15 years ago we would not be in the mess we find ourselves in today. Instead creative individuals would be retelling the patterns in a way that resonates with every developer while still preserving a thread back to the analysis that led to each pattern's initial expression.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 'patterns' Cunningham speaks of are <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PatternsForBeginners">software design patterns</a>, which his wiki catalogs and discusses, though his wisdom applies to any collaborative work in any field.</p>
