<p>Queensland University of Technology (QUT) will lead the license translation and work to expand global access to Australia's culture</p>
<p>Palo Alto, USA, and Brisbane, AUSTRALIA - March 25, 2004 - Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative works free for copying and re-use, announced today that it would expand its International Commons (iCommons) project to Australia. </p>
<p>Queensland University of Technology (QUT), in Brisbane, will lead the effort.</p>
<p>First announced in March 2003, iCommons is Creative Commons' project to make its machine-readable copyright licenses useful worldwide. </p>
<p>As the lead institution, QUT will coordinate a public effort to translate the Creative Commons licenses literally and legally for use in Australia. </p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be working with Queensland University of Technology," said Lawrence Lessig, Chairman of Creative Commons and professor of law at Stanford University, in the U.S. "Australia will be a vital participant in bringing the international cultural Commons to fruition." </p>
<p>"We are also excited to be involved in developing Creative Commons in Australia," explained Project Co-Leader Brian Fitzgerald, Professor and Head of the School of Law at QUT.  "There is already strong demand within the Australian community for a legal means of facilitating the distribution of Open Content, and Creative Commons will be a tremendous platform on which to build these protocols and agreements." </p>
<p>Tom Cochrane, Project Co-Leader and Deputy Vice Chancellor at QUT, said that with copyright law and regulation getting more attention by the day, QUT was pleased to be associated with this international effort to find collaborative solutions more appropriate to rapidly changing digital environments. </p>
<p>"Even within the University, there are already numerous direct applications of the model in our day to day academic work," Mr Cochrane said.</p>
<p>QUT will field comments on an archived email discussion at the Creative Commons website, <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#australia">http://www.creativecommons.org/discuss#australia</a>.</p>
<p>Australia joins Brazil, China, Croatia, Finland, France, Ireland, Japan, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and Jordan in the iCommons effort.</p>
