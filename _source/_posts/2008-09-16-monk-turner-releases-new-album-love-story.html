<p>LA-based multi-instrumentalist and former <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7981">Featured Commoner</a> <a href="http://www.myspace.com/monkturner"><strong>Monk Turner</strong></a> released his latest album, <em>Love Story</em>, a little under a week ago for <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/monkslovestory">free download on archive.org</a>. The album is released under a CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND license</a>, making it his fifth album released in this vein, his <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/calendar">second this year</a>, and twentieth overall. From <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=creator:%22Monk%20Turner%22">Monk Turner</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn't planning on making another concept album after I recorded my first one. But, somehow 20 albums later here we are. Being that this was going to be the 20th, I wanted to do something special and go beyond making just another album. About three years ago, a friend suggested I write an album of romantic love songs instead of the usual love dilemmas I tend to write about. While this idea excited me, I wanted a 3rd dimension and I thought this would be a great opportunity to take the idea of 'concept art' to the next level by including conceptual visual art. After a long search I found Junji Lee as a visual artist who suggested the love songs follow the Buddhist path to enlightenment or 10 Bulls. In typical fashion, the whole album was written in just under 2 weeks and demos were sent out for critique.
