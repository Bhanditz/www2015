<p>As of yesterday (January 15, 2014), the <a href="http://earthobservations.org/about_geo.shtml" title="Group on Earth Observations" target="_blank">Group on Earth Observations</a> approved Creative Commons as now a Participating Organization (PO) at its GEO-X Plenary in Geneva.</p>
<p>GEO was launched in response to calls for action by the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development and by the G8 (Group of Eight) leading industrialized countries to exploit the growing potential of Earth observations to support decision making in an increasingly complex and environmentally stressed world. GEO is coordinating efforts to build a <a href="http://www.earthobservations.org/geoss.shtml" title="GEOSS" target="_blank">Global Earth Observation System of Systems</a> (GEOSS).</p>

<p>GEOSS provides decision-support tools to a wide variety of users via a global and flexible network of content providers. GEOSS lets decision makers access a range of information by linking together existing and planned observing systems around the world and support the development of new systems where gaps exist. GEOSS promotes common technical standards so that data from the thousands of different instruments can be combined into coherent data sets. The <a href="http://www.geoportal.org" title="GEOPortal" target="_blank">GEOPortal</a> offers a single Internet access point for users seeking data, imagery, and analytical software packages relevant to all parts of the globe. For users with limited or no access to the internet, similar information is available via the <a href="http://www.earthobservations.org/geonetcast.shtml" title="GEONETCast" target="_blank">GEONETCast</a> network of telecommunication satellites.</p>
<p>GEO is a voluntary partnership of governments and international organizations providing a framework to develop new projects and coordinate their strategies and investments. As of 2013, GEOâ€™s Members include 89 Governments and the European Commission. In addition, 67 intergovernmental, international, and regional organizations with a mandate in Earth observation or related issues have been recognized as Participating Organizations (PO).</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/science/board#chen" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Chen</a>, CC's Science Advisory Board member, was at the Plenary, and he had the following comment, "The GEO Executive Director, Barbara Ryan, pointed out in plenary that there was an extensive discussion in the GEO Executive Committee about making sure that new POs are active contributors to GEO activities. She noted that all of the proposed POs in today's slate met this criterion."</p>
<p>Creative Commons has been contributing to the GEO Data Sharing Task Force's Legal Interoperability Sub-Group and its draft white paper on "<a href="http://www.earthobservations.org/documents/dsp/draft_white_paper_geoss_legal_interoperability_30_october_2011.pdf" target="_blank" title="Legal Options for the Exchange of Data through the GEOSS Data-CORE">Legal Options for the Exchange of Data through the GEOSS Data-CORE (PDF)</a>." (I was a part of the Sub-Group as a Science Fellow, and our Senior Counsel, Sarah Pearson, reviewed the paper). We intend to continue to be active contributors by guiding GEO and its members on the legal aspects of data sharing.</p>
<p>Thanks to Paul Uhlir of the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/brdi/index.htm" title="BRDI, NAS" target="_blank">Board on Research Data and Information, National Academies</a> for making the right introductions; and to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/science/board#wilbanks" target="_blank">John Wilbanks</a>, another Science Advisory Board member, for initially encouraging CC to get involved with GEO.</p>
