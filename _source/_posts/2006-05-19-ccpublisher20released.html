<p>I'm pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher">ccPublisher 2</a>.  ccPublisher is<br />
an application which allows users to select licenses for their work and<br />
publish them to the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> for permanent,<br />
free hosting.  Files in supported formats will have license information<br />
embedded in them.  If you're more into hosting your work yourself, ccPublisher will generate some HTML for you that lets others validate the license it embeds in the file.</p>
<p>While this release doesn't sport lots of new end user features, it does<br />
have a nifty new under-the-hood architecture which will allow other<br />
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher_Developer">developers</a> to more easily contribute to the application.  It also<br />
features a much improved uploading module for more robust uploads to the<br />
Internet Archive.</p>
<p>As always, feedback, suggestions and bug reports are welcome and encouraged.  See<br />
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher_2">the release page</a> for Windows and Linux downloads.  Mac OS X downloads will be available Monday, 22 May, 2006.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Shortly after this announcement a few relatively wide-spread bugs were reported through the crash reportor.  For that reason, release 2.0.2 is now available.  Updated downloads available at the link above.  Thanks to everyone who clicks "OK" when asked to send a crash report.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Mac OS X downloads are now available from <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcPublisher_2">the release page</a>.</p>
