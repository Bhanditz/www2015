<p>We wrapped up the <a href="http://icommons.org/programme/">iCommons Summit</a> yesterday.  It was a fantastic and inspiring event bringing together a diversity of skills, viewpoints, experiences and cultures but all connected to and passionate about issues relevant to "the commons."  You can find more information about what was discussed from <a href="http://www.icommons.org/isummit">the summit website</a>.  In addition, the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/26/arts/26crea.html?ex=1308974400&en=ee236a3fa211ed30&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">today</a> has a very good overview article about the Summit.</p>
