<p>Joi Ito is teaching his Digital Journalism course again at Keio  University this summer, but this time with a  twist. In addition to the traditional semester, where Joi will be  teaching within the university, the course will also have an open and  online component where anyone may apply to join via the <a id="o4b7" title="Peer 2 Peer University" href="http://p2pu.org/">Peer 2  Peer University</a> (P2PU). <a href="http://www.p2pu.org/journalism">Digital Journalism 2010</a> will run for seven weeks with seven physical meetings which will be  webcast and allow for online participation. Additionally, asynchronous  communications will continue between classes on mailing lists, the class  blog, wiki, and the <a id="aw8-" title="P2PU" href="http://p2pu.org/journalism">P2PU</a> platform.</p>
<p>Digital Journalism 2010 is "an introduction to online  journalism, citizen media and the use of social networks for journalism  and collective action. Participants will work on self defined projects  either as individuals or in groups using any combination of media types  including video, photographs, illustrations and text as well as online  tools such as blogs, wikis, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and any other  reasonable tool the participant or team would like to use." In addition  to learning about how the journalism landscape is rapidly changing,  participants will learn to research and create news online by publishing  stories of their own in teams. These stories will be presented to the  class (and the world).</p>
<p>The course is a work in progress, so the community can <a href="http://www.p2pu.org/journalism"> contribute</a> by suggesting readings, activities, and more. P2PU is looking  for course organizers to facilitate the P2PU end of things. If  interested, please contact thepeople [at] p2pu.org. To participate in the course remotely via P2PU, you can sign up  to apply at <a href="http://www.p2pu.org/journalism" target="_blank">www.p2pu.org/journalism</a>. Sign-up is open now and the course will begin on Friday, 4 June.</p>
