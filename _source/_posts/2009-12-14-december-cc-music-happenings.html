<p>Three stories from the Creative Commons music world came across our radar recently, each showcasing a different facet of how our licenses are used to expose artists, encourage collaboration, and promote commercial avenues for freely-licensed works.</p>
<p><img src="img/everybodyCoverCC1.jpg" alt="everybodyCoverCC" title="everybodyCoverCC" width="300" height="299" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />First comes news today that <a href="http://www.theeverybody.com/">The Everybody</a>, a new project from Joey Santiago and David Lovering (guitarist and drummer of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixies">Pixies</a>, respectively), have released their latest album <em>Avatar</em> with a CC-licensed twist. Available in both MP3 and lossless formats, a deluxe version of the album can be purchased ($40) that includes CC <del datetime="2009-12-14T22:32:38+00:00">BY</del> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">BY-SA</a> licensed stems for each track. Beyond the legal freedoms this choice allows, The Everybody are asking for submissions of re-worked tacks to include in a forthcoming release which will be submitted the band through CC-friendly music community <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2009/12/14/the-everybody-wants-you/">Soundcloud</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once David and Joey have had a chance to check out all of the tracks theyâ€™re going to choose the best of the best of these new creations and turn them into an album called <em>The Everybody Else</em> and release it as a limited-edition gatefold vinyl alongside the originals in Spring 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/">Phlow Magazine</a> is currently running a month-long feature calledÂ <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/">The Best Creative Commons Music Moments in 2009</a>. Every day until Christmas, a new post goes live from one of "<a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1535-machtdose-best-of-2009">the</a> <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1519-christian-grasse-best-of-2009">worlds</a> <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1513-michael-gregoire-best-of-2009">most</a> <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1522-netwaves-best-of-2009">active</a> <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1496-brigitte-bijoux-best-of-2009">Creative</a> <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1528-masayukis-best-of-2009">Commons</a> <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1522-netwaves-best-of-2009">music</a> <a href="http://phlow-magazine.com/charts/1510-mogwai-best-of-2009">freaks</a>," featuring their favorite songs, netlabels, and albums from the open music universe. The series gives a great overview of how diverse and expansive CC-licensed music has become, unearthing a bevy of musical gems in the process.</p>

<p><a href="http://seriouslyinteractive.com/">The Monome Community Remix Project</a> is a collaborative project in which contributors create samples, upload them to a community pool, and make remixes from the community collection. In keeping with its namesake, all remixes must utilize the <a href="http://monome.org/">monome</a>, an open-source hardware controller, as a compositional tool. The first round of the project is now complete, with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA</a> licensed compilation of the final remixes available for download and stream at the <a href="http://seriouslyinteractive.com/">MCRP website</a>. The <a href="http://post.monome.org/comments.php?DiscussionID=6525">second iteration</a> is currently underway, although the initial deadline for contributions has passed. Thankfully, a third round is planned for January.</p>
