<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com"><img src="img/logo.png" alt="Kickstarter Logo" title="Kickstarter Logo" width="100" height="101" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-19072" /></a>I started working full time for Creative Commons on June 2nd, 2008 just after finishing my masters at ITP. The last year and half has been an incredible experience as I've spent my time doing CC outreach, advocacy, and product development. But it is time for me to move on, and I'm excited to announce that starting December 1st, I'll be working at NYC based start-up <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> is a funding platform for creators, and represents a refreshing way of thinking about supporting cultural production and creators. Most importantly, Kickstarter, like Creative Commons, offers a real mechanism for creators to connect with their supporters and share their work in a way that acknowledges the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_%28economics%29">inevitabilities of digital media</a>. Having launched and successfully funded <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fred/emoji-dick">my own project</a> through Kickstarter, I know this platform works and I'm incredibly excited by its potential. But Kickstarter is also something that many of us in the free culture community have always dreamed of -- a way to directly fund cultural production and its creators without resorting to leveraging scarcity and exclusivity. </p>
<p>I'm going to be doing very similar things at Kickstarter that I've been doing at CC: outreach, advocacy, some product, some community, some biz dev, and lots of pondering the future of culture and collaboration. But I'm also really looking forward to sharing a lot of the principles and relationships I developed at CC with my new colleagues, so if we're currently working together on something, I'm sure we'll still have plenty to talk about. </p>
<p>Working for Creative Commons has been fantastic, and I really couldn't have imagined a better way or a better group of people to spend the last couple of years with, so it is not without some sadness that I'm leaving. So let's stay in touch! <a href="http://twitter.com/mecredis">Find me on twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.fredbenenson.com/blog">check out my blog</a>, or just drop me a line at fcb at fredbenenson.com.</p>
<p>See you on the ole tubes! </p>
