<p>"[B]ecause of the discrete selling and buying of music, digital single by digital single, that iTunes and its kin will foster, we can expect a decline in music bundling, and thus in risk-taking and its shy companion, innovation."</p>
<p>A thought-provoking <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/06/18/itunes_innovation/index.html">piece</a> by Sahar Akhtar in <a href="http://salon.com">Salon</a> today. Akhtar predicts that iTunes-like services will lead to a shallow, ear-candy music economy.</p>
<p>Questions for the author, and Creative Commons blog readers:</p>
<p><b>(1)</b> Isn't Akhtar <em>really</em> advocating music-snob paternalism? <em>Listen to the songs as I package them for you, because I know better than you how your tastes should run.</em> This attitude might be fine for a DJ spinning a set, but not for an entire market. To a savvy consumer, or an antitrust lawyer, "music bundling" sounds like a euphemism for tying listeners' hands.</p>
<p><b>(2)</b> To avert the death of the art-rock album format, couldn't artists simply begin producing CDs without indexed tracks? If you really want someone to listen to a whole album, let the technology push them that way.</p>
<p><b>(3)</b> How often do musicians (real ones, not A&R puppets) really consider the format of distribution when writing a hook? When you've stumbled upon an edgy arrangement or harmony, are you really going to scrap it because of that pesky new iTunes?</p>
<p><b>(4)</b> I like b-sides, too. But before Net-based music, the only way to find obscure b-sides and outtakes was to buy a boxed set, or an EP single -- which without exception included the hit songs that die-hard fans had <em>already paid for</em> on albums. (I must have bought four copies of the <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=CASS80306190005&sql=Bvx5ibkr96akv">Pixies</a>' "This Monkey's Gone to Heaven" just to hear a few rare b-sides it was bundled with.) Why force cult fans to doubly subsidize hit singles?</p>
<p><b>(5)</b> "'B sides' and the noncommercially oriented tracks that fill out a given album have always been the artistic payoff." Sure, sometimes, but <em>always</em>? Ever listen to a <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=CASS80306190014&sql=B97evad5kv8w4">Police</a> album all the way through? I'm pretty sure the U.S. military used those b-sides for psychological warfare in Iraq.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
