The manuals themselves are freely licensed and often written in <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/booksprints">book sprints</a>. This January, as part of the <a href="http://www.transmediale.de/en/collaborative-futures">Transmediale festival</a> in Berlin, FLOSS Manuals attempted its first non-manual booksprint -- a considerably harder task, as no structure is implied. Only the book title, <em><a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/collaborativefutures/">Collaborative Futures</a></em>, was given -- a collaborative experiment about the future of collaboration.</p>
<p>The initial collaborators each had considerable experience with free software or free culture collaborations -- <a href="http://www.mandiberg.com/2010/03/18/collaborative-futures-press-coverage/">Michael Mandiberg</a>, <a href="http://www.lapetiteclaudine.com/archives/014029.html">Marta Peirano</a>, <a href="http://knowfuture.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/collaborative-futures-in-nyc-and-some-notes/">Alan Toner</a>, <a href="http://www.mushon.com/2010/01/23/collaborative-futures-day5-done/">Mushon Zer-Aviv</a>, me, and FLOSS Manuals' honcho <a href="http://lists.flossmanuals.net/pipermail/discuss-flossmanuals.net/2010-January/002845.html">Adam Hyde</a> and programmer <a href="http://www.binarni.net/">Aleksandar Erkalovic</a>. </p>
<p>Initially we thought we'd write much about licenses and other topics much debated by those in the free software and free culture community. After a day of intense discussion of book content and structure, those debates were left in the background as we tackled explaining what kinds of collaboration we intended to write about and speculating about what the future of collaboration holds. As appropriate, we did use licenses -- the book is released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC Attribution-ShareAlike license</a> and incorporates a fair amount of previously existing material under the same or compatible licenses (surprisingly enough, none from Wikipedia).</p>
<p>A one minute video was made for the book's <a href="http://upgrade.eyebeam.org/2010/02/collaborative-futures-book-launch-talk/">New York launch</a>, available at the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/CollaborativeFuturesBooksprintIntro2010">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/9840822">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a licensing (and collaboration?) story behind the video. Producer Bennett Williamson wanted to use <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Ergo_Phizmiz_amp_Margita_Zalite/Lamps_and_Chairs__Music_For_Interior_Design/Rolands_Vegners">â€œRolands Vegnersâ€ by Ergo Phizmiz & Margita Zalite</a> as the soundtrack. Bennett writes on <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/member/bennett4senate/blog/Ten_Tracks_to_Sync_-_Vol_2">his Free Music Archive blog</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>This was a problem, because <em>Collaborative Futures</em> (and all its related materials) <em>already had a different type of CC license</em> than Ergo's track; Attribution-ShareAlike and Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike respectively.</p>
<p>I really liked the song and wanted to keep it in the video, so I contacted Ergo and asked him if he'd be willing to change the license type of his track... and he agreed! Score one for copyright alternatives!</p>
<p>So remember kids, when syncing up these jams to your sweet vids, make sure that your derivitive has a license that jives with that of the original work. And sometimes all you have to do is ask.</p>
<p>With that, here's ten more instrumentals from the Archives ready for you to slap into your timeline. Thanks to those of you who made suggestions of tracks to include; please keep them coming!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All well worth keeping in mind for future collaborations. Check out the <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/collaborativefutures/">book</a>, and more importantly, <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net">FLOSS Manuals</a> and the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a>, excellent free culture projects covering a broad range of tastes.</p>
