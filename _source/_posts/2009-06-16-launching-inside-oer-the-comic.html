<p>For those of you who've been following, ccLearn started interviewing innovative people and projects in the open education space last April, when we kicked things off with a highly informative <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8235">interview of Leigh Blackall</a> at Otago Polytechnic (the university whose default licensing policy is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/">CC BY</a>. <em><a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/projects/inside-oer">Inside OER</a></em> is the current culmination of our efforts, the full suite of interviews available for redistribution and remix at the <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/">ccLearn site</a>.</p>
<p>Now we've tried something new. For our latest <em>Inside OER</em>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/featured-projects/2009/06/16/15168">IssueLabâ€™s Lisa Brooks on Opening Up Research</a>, we decided to make our own adaptation, lifting the complete text of the interview and remixing it with images, screen shots, and speech bubbles. Drawing extensively from resources in the <a href="http://www.pdclipart.org/">public domain</a>, CC licensed photos on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/advanced/?">Flickr</a>, and the help of a handy application known as <a href="http://plasq.com/comiclife/">Comic Life</a>, we give you our very first issue of <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/projects/inside-oer#The Comic"><em>Inside OER</em>, the Comic</a>.<br />
<a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/projects/inside-oer#The Comic"><img src="img/inside-oer-icon-300x239.jpg" alt="inside-oer-icon" title="inside-oer-icon" width="200" height="139" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15299" /></a><br />
Hopefully, this will not only grab but sustain short attention spans. <a href="http://www.issuelab.org">IssueLab</a>, in particular, is doing great things for the open education community and Lisa is especially apt at articulating exactly what that is and what they are aiming for.</p>
<p>The comic is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>, of course, so share and derive away! You can also remix the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/featured-projects/2009/06/16/15168">text version</a> at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/interviews">CC Talks With</a>. </p>
