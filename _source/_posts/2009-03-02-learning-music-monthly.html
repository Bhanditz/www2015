<p><a href="http://www.learningmusicmonthly.com/">Learning Music Monthly</a> is a new subscription-based, album-a-month, musical series from L.A.-based musician John Wood. <a href="http://machineproject.com/events/2009/03/01/learning-music/">Launched yesterday</a> in partnership with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8070">CC-friendly</a> record label <a href="http://vosotros.com/">vosotros</a>, Learning Music Monthly grows out of a previous and similar project that began as an album-a-month project for John Wood and his musical cohorts, resulting in releases that ranged from a record made entirely on a hand-held cassette recorder to "an autobiographical musical written by a robot."</p>
<p>Building upon new methods of music distribution, LMM is being offered as a <a href="http://www.learningmusicmonthly.com/subscribe.html">tiered subscription service</a> that ranges from a donation-based digital option to a $60 package that includes, amongst other amenities, a handmade album delivered by mail each month, limited edition stickers, bonus albums from friends of LM, and a song written and recorded <em>for you</em>, delivered on your birthday. The band is also offering a lifetime VIP subscription, which includes a private performance anywhere in the world. From <a href="http://www.learningmusicmonthly.com/about.html">LMM</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Learning Music Monthly is a collaborative, subscription-based album-a-month series. As a subscriber, you receive a brand new full-length album of original music every month. You can choose to receive your monthly issues on CD (delivered to your mailbox in beautiful handmade packaging, with cover art by a different artist each issue), or in downloadable high-quality mp3 format. Subscribers also receive unlimited access to our online archive of music, including a newly re-mastered album from the original twelve Learning Music albums released each month. Additionally, you are invited to collaborate in the creation of Learning Music Monthly, with remixes, covers, and sound donations, regardless of whether you are a subscriber or not. </p></blockquote>
<p>As one of the primary foci of Learning Music Monthly is collaboration, the website features numerous ways for the LM community to get involved. Found sounds, remixes, cover versions, and videos are all encouraged and LM has gone so far as to begin filling the section on their own, including audio stems for the first installmentâ€™s single <em>Short Tempered</em>. All of the material - from the original music to artwork to samples - is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>, an essential aspect of the project that makes this kind of digital collaboration legally sound and clear.</p>
<p>The project has just begun, so be sure to head over to the Learning Music Monthly <a href="http://www.learningmusicmonthly.com/">homepage</a> and learn more about what is happening. Similarly, the project has launched with a <a href="http://learningmusic.cashmusic.org/">page at CASH Music</a>, the CC-using music nonprofit "dedicated to improving the music experience for artists and listeners alike."</p>
