<p><img src="img/ctw-logo.jpg" alt="" title="ctw-logo" width="240" height="240" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" />Late last year we began reaching out to those working to expose and support CC-licensed music for help with our <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/">curator portal</a> at the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/">Free Music Archive</a>. Our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/19283">first guest curator</a> was <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> admin <a href="http://fourstones.net/">Victor Stone</a>, whose mix highlighted the talent of the ccMixter community. Now, we are happy to present the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/New_Mix_3355">second mix in the series</a>, featuring some incredible tracks selected by CC/netlabel music blog <a href="http://soundthefreetrumpet.typepad.com/">Catching The Waves</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am deeply honoured to join in the fun at the FMA. My mix consists of some of the best tracks from some of the best albums that have been lassooed (SP) at CTW. It features lots of different genres, tempi and moods (rock, IDM, trip-hop, minimal, folk, ambient, etc.,) from as far afield as Germany, Japan, Colombia, the United States, France, Canada, Italy and the U.K. It was murderously difficult to whittle the mix down to a still unwieldy twenty tracks. It would be wonderful if people who were new to netlabels, and CC music in general, stumbled upon these songs and realised, as I did, that there's a whole world of wonderful music just waiting to be discovered â€“ and that it's all free, legal and made by artists who want their music to be downloaded, copied and shared. Catching the waves can be fun...</p></blockquote>
<p>You can listen to the whole mix at our <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Creative_Commons/">FMA Curator Portal</a>. Big thanks to Catching The Waves for the excellent selection!</p>
