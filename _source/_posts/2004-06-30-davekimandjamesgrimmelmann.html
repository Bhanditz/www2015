<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#30">Dave Kim</a> and<br />
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#29">James Grimmelmann</a>, hailing from Georgetown and Yale law schools respectively, are Creative Commons' summer interns this year. They're both doing great work. <a title="Ok, so this is a non sequitur -- I needed an excuse!">So great that we forgot to blog their presence until now.</a></p>
