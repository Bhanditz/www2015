<p>We just received some tremendously exciting news. <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/" target="_blank">Democracy Now!</a> - the daily news program broadcast by hundreds of radio and television stations around the world (itâ€™s also the source of a very popular <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/podcast.xml" target="_blank">podcast</a>) - is now being offered under a Creative Commons <a href="../licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/" target="_blank">BY-NC-ND</a> license. This includes not only new episodes, but also those in the showâ€™s archive, dating back to the programâ€™s beginnings in 1996. The show, hosted by journalists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Goodman" target="_blank">Amy Goodman</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Gonzalez_%28journalist%29" target="_blank">Juan Gonzalez</a>, and originally created by <a href="http://www.pacifica.org/" target="_blank">Pacifica</a> Radio (which has continued to provide critical support for the program since it became an independent production), is funded by listeners, viewers, and foundations who believe in independent media - an approach to doing things that we here at CC wholeheartedly respect (visit our <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">fundraising drive</a> for more on this). Democracy Now! was founded to report on issues and stories that the producers believe are underreported by mainstream news outlets. The programâ€™s new usage terms are made clear via a Creative Commons license notice at the bottom of each episodeâ€™s page (see todayâ€™s conversation with <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2008/11/19/cornel_west_on_the_election_of" target="_blank">Cornel West</a> for anÂ example).</p>
