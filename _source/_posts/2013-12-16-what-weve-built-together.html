<p>On this date in 2002, we launched the first Creative Commons license suite. But it&#8217;s what happened next that matters.</p>
<p>Thousands of creators started using CC licenses to share their works, everything from film to educational resources to science research. And sometime between then and now, the world changed a little.</p>
<p>Musicians started thinking less about piracy and more about how they could benefit from fans sharing their music. Entrepreneurs developed business models based on open licenses, proving that you can share your work without sacrificing profit.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s something else. <a href="http://teamopen.cc/"><em>People began to demand open</em></a>. We started expecting it from our governments, our universities, and our employers. Legally, All Rights Reserved is still the default, but today, it&#8217;s a choice. Today, people notice when those in power choose <em>closed</em>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not delay the obvious any longer: we&#8217;re writing to ask for money. As you&#8217;re considering which charities to support this year, please take a moment to reflect on what we&#8217;ve built together over the past 11 years.</p>
<p>When you use a Creative Commons license, you fuel a movement for open that spans every country on earth. A CC license badge isn&#8217;t just a legal tool; it&#8217;s a symbol for the better world that we can make together. Thank you for joining Team Open.</p>
<p><a href="https://donate.creativecommons.org/?utm_campaign=2013fund&utm_source=blog4&utm_medium=blog">Please make a donation to Creative Commons at whatever level you can afford</a>. We have some t-shirts and other gifts for donors, but more importantly, we promise to use every cent to fight harder than ever for open.</p>
<p>Year 12 starts now.</p>
