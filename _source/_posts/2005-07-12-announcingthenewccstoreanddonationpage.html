<p>We're happy to announce that <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">we have revamped our online store and donations page</a> to highlight new t-shirts and products available with a Creative Commons logo. We've got new Science Commons shirts, a new shirt for 2005 donations, and a variety of products from Cafepress as well.</p>
<p>All proceeds aid our non-profit and help us maintain our charitable non-profit status. If you'd like to show your support for the Creative Commons, the best way is to become a Commoner today. We offer several different gift packages in exchange for your tax-deductible donations.</p>
<p>One of our new interns <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#44">Fred</a> cooked up <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=600,height=400,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false;" href="http://creativecommons.org/extras/ccstore">a pretty cool flash movie for the announcement</a>.</p>
