<p>Thanks to everyone who came out to our second big photo scavenger hunt on Saturday. We had awesome weather and dozens of teams show up. StreetFilms, a project of TOPP, even <a href="http://www.streetfilms.org/archives/wikis-take-manhattan/">made a video about it</a>, appropriately licensed under our BY-NC-ND license. </p>
