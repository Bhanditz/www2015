<p>If you're in the SF Bay Area, we hope to see you at our next <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/San_Francisco_Salon">Creative Commons Salon</a> on the power of open education, featuring:</p>
<p><strong>Brian Bridges</strong>, Director of the <a href="http://www.clrn.org/">California Learning Resource Network</a> (CLRN)<br />
<strong>Murugan Pal</strong>, co-Founder and President of <a href="http://www.ck12.org/">CK-12 Foundation</a><br />
<strong>Carolina Rossini</strong>, <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/crossini">Berkman Fellow</a>, Advocate for OER in Brazil, and <a href="http://p2pu.org/">Peer2Peer University</a> community member  </p>
<p>The Internet and digital technologies have transformed how people learn. Educational resources are no longer static and scarce, but adaptable and widely available, allowing educational institutions, teachers, and learners to actively participate in a global exchange of knowledge via <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER">Open Educational Resources</a> (OER). At next month's salon, we'll be gathering together three preeminent individuals involved in shaping the future of education and harnessing the power of the internet and digital technologies as forces for good in this field. Each participant will give a brief presentation on their respective projects, followed by an informal panel/discussion period where we'll explore more in depth the issues, challenges, and opportunities emerging in the field of education.</p>
<p>This is a great chance to meet CC staff, learn more about Creative Commons, and connect with Bay Area creators and innovators. Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>When: Monday, May 3, 7-9pm<br />
