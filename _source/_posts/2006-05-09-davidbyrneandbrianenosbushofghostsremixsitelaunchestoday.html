<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne_%28musician%29">David Byrne</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno's</a> landmark sampling album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_(album)"><i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i></a> was recently remastered and reissued with extensive liner notes, photos, previously unreleased bonus tracks, and the short film <a href="http://bushofghosts.wmg.com/watch_video.php"><i>Mea Culpa</i></a> by multimedia artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Conner">Bruce Conner</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Now comes the best part!</strong> Today, Byrne and Eno launched a <a href="http://www.bush-of-ghosts.com/">Web site</a> where the audio source files from two of the classic tracks from <i>Bush of Ghosts</i> -- "A Secret Life" and "Help Me Somebody" -- are offered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 license</a>, so you can (subject to the download terms of use) use them to make remixes. The site allows uploads and user ratings, as well as the ability to share videos you make for music on <i>Bush of Ghosts</i>.</p>
<p>This is incredibly exciting and we can't wait to see all the cool creativity that comes out of this project.</p>
