<p>Jason Scott has created a <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com">five plus hour documentary series on Bulletin Board Systems</a>. Prior to the commercial Internet local BBSes were "the net" for anyone without an Internet connection, typically only provided by major universities and research institutions. In short, BBSes are where many long time net denizens cut their electronic media teeth (including me in the mid to late 1980s) and BBS culture was an important input into today's commercial Internet culture (BBS technology however has almost entirely been superseded).</p>
<p>I heard awhile ago that this documentary was in production and I've been eagerly awaiting its release. I'm now thrilled to learn that 1) it has been released, 2) under a Creative Commons license, 3) under a liberal Creative Commons license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0</a>), and 4) the creator has posted a <a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/000123.html">great essay</a> on how to make a great product and why he chose to CC license his great product.</p>
<p><a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/000123.html">Read Jasons's essay</a> and <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/order/">check out the DVD set</a>. Proceed to enjoy, rip, share, remix and share again (and alike).</p>
