<p>While we've been plugging away at copyright licensing it appears, at least according to our recent press hits, that Creative Commons is starting to hit a critical mass. Two high profile features came out today: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/howto/article/0,aid,117822,00.asp">one about legal downloads</a> at the Internet Archive released under a Creative Commons license (in next month's PC World Magazine), and another from eWeek, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1662698,00.asp">about how well our licensing is catching on</a>. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=%22creative+commons%22&ie=UTF-8&scoring=d">There are many more stories</a> coming out every day about Creative Commons, and then, of course, there's <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">next month's big mention in WIRED</a>.</p>
