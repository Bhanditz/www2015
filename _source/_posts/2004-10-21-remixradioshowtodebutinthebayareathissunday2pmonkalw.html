<p>Cult radio favorite Benjamen Walker takes listeners through a novel, lawyer-free look at recombinant art.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SAN FRANCISCO</span>, USA  October 21, 2004</p>
<p>At 2pm this Sunday, October 24, San Franciscoâ€™s <span class="caps">KALW</span><br />
will debut a unique new radio special: â€œThe Creative Remix,â€ written<br />
and hosted by Benjamen Walker and sponsored by the nonprofit Creative<br />
Commons, is an hour-long â€œlawyer freeâ€ examination of the art, culture,<br />
and history of the remix in the broadest sense of the word. (More: <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio/">http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/radio/</a>).</p>
<p>The hour kicks off with a musical analysis of a familiar sort of remix: <span class="caps">DJ </span>Dangermouseâ€™s<br />
infamous mash-up of the Beatles and Jay-Z. Walker then takes listeners<br />
back in time to check out the ancient Roman art of the poetry mash-up,<br />
or the Cento. The show then rewinds to the 18th century to check out<br />
the birth of copyright and how it affected writers like Alexander Pope;<br />
and the early 20th century when the visual artist Marcel Duchamp used<br />
the remix to reinvent everything. Walker also takes a field trip to the<br />
Mass Mocca museum of modern art to check out the exhibit â€œYankee<br />
Remix,â€ where he talks to a few grad students and a pair of<br />
curmudgeonly New England antique collectors to investigate different<br />
attitudes towards remixing.</p>
<p>In the second part of the<br />
program Walker speaks with three unique remix artists: The historical<br />
novelist Matthew Pearl, â€œWalkman Busterâ€ Gideon Dâ€™arcangelo, and Cory<br />
Arcangel, a Nintendo hacker and one of the youngest representatives at<br />
this yearâ€™s Whitney Biennial.</p>
<p>â€œâ€˜The Creative Remixâ€™ will<br />
enlighten even the confirmed aficionado of recombinant art,â€ said Glenn<br />
Otis Brown, executive director of Creative Commons. â€œI manage an<br />
organization dedicated to highlighting artistic re-uses and<br />
transformations, and I had never before thought of remixing in quite<br />
the way Walker presents it. Itâ€™s eye-opening stuff for anyone who cares<br />
about art and the increasingly disturbing trend of lawyersâ€™ influencing<br />
it.â€</p>
<p>The show airs the same week that <span class="caps">WIRED</span></p>
<p>magazineâ€™s special November music issue hits newsstands. The issue will<br />
ship with a CD with tracks by the likes of the Beastie Boys, Gilberto<br />
Gil, David Byrne, and 13 others. Every song is covered by a Creative<br />
Commons copyright license that invites fans to file-share the songs or<br />
sample from them, on certain conditions. (More: <a href="http://creativecommons.org">http://creativecommons.org</a>).</p>
