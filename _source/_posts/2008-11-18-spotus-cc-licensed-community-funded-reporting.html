<p><a href="http://spot.us/">Spot.us</a> is a recentlly launched nonprofit project from the <a href="http://www.centerformediachange.com/">Center for Media Change</a> that <a href="http://spot.us/pages/about">aims</a> to pioneer â€œcommunity funded reporting.â€ Stories are pitched online with an amount of money needed for publication - users and site visitors can donate to any pitch they deem worthy, with the resulting article released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY license</a>. From <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=101&amp;aid=146504">Poytner Online</a><span class="lol"></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users create story ideas that they think should be investigated and submit them to the site. From these ideas, journalists choose to write story pitches and open the idea up to the public to make donations. Once the project reaches its funding goal, those who have donated pay up and the journalist produces the story. If the project doesn't receive enough funding, no one is charged. After the story is complete, Spot.Us publishes it and offers it to news organizations for free (the site's content is licensed under Creative Commons). There is an option for news organizations to buy exclusive rights to the story, with the funding money going back to the journalist.

<p>Spot.us has been getting a ton of great press including a nice write-up in the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/weekinreview/24kershaw.html?_r=2&amp;oref&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">New York Times</a></em>. Check out the site - no articles have been published yet but there are plenty of great pitches waiting to be funded. Similarly, don't hesitate to start your own.</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> Spot.us  and Wikinews are both presenting <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10726">tomorrow at a special CC Salon San Francisco on citizen journalism</a>. It's cool that both sites use the permissive CC BY license -- they could each reuse the other's stories, so long as they give credit -- and you could too.</p>
