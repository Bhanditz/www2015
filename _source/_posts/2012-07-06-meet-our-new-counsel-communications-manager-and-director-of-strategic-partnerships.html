<p>Recently, three awesome people joined the CC team, including Kat Walsh (new CC Counsel), Elliot Harmon, (new CC Communications Manager), and Sara Crouse (new CC Director of Strategic Partnerships). You'll be seeing their names pop up often in email exchanges, at events, and on this blog. </p>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#katwalsh">Kat</a> joins us with an extensive background in the free culture and software communities. She has been a board member of the Wikimedia Foundation since 2006, where her focus is on legal and community issues, and she was previously a policy analyst at the American Library Association Office for Information Technology Policy. Kat has a BA from Stetson University and a JD from George Mason University. In her secret double life, she is a classical musician, performing on bassoon and viola.<br />

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#elliotharmon">Elliot</a> has worked in the non-profit sector for eight years, mostly in the arts and technology. He has a degree in English and theatre from the University of South Dakota and a Masterâ€™s in writing from the California College of the Arts. When heâ€™s not thinking about CCâ€™s communications strategy, heâ€™s often thinking about cooking, poetry, or music. He also wrote this <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33156">recent CC post</a> on how support for Open Access to science research is growing.<br />

<a href="http://creativecommons.org/staff#saracrouse">Sara</a> also joins us with a background in free culture. From 2008-11, Sara was Head of Partnerships & Foundation Relations for the Wikimedia Foundation. Previously, she worked in development for Cambridge in America; and at several non- and for-profit ventures based in New York City. Sara is on the board of the Global Lives Project. She has a joint Masters in Journalism and French Studies from New York University, and a B.A. in French and English Literature from Georgetown University. Most days, Sara can be found attempting diplomatic negotiation on behalf of open knowledge, crafting with words, or inventing easier ways to do things at the office. Otherwise, she is likely hiking, cooking, reading, or out and about in San Francisco; most always with her dogs.</p>
<p>Please join us in welcoming our new team members. We hope to do great work in furthering openness together. </p>
