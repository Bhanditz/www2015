If you're in Los Angeles, you might want to check out Chairman of the Creative Commons, Lawrence Lessig, along with former recording industry head Hilary Rosen <a href="http://www.usc.edu/calendar/events/19306.html">tonight and tomorrow at USC's Bovard Auditorium</a>. <a href="http://web32.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetEventInfo?ticketCode=SP413-03&linkID=trojanse">Tickets are $10</a>, and Creative Commons will be there giving out information and licensed music CDs (more about the CDs shortly).</p>
