<p><img src="img/cashlogo.png" alt="cashlogo" title="cashlogo" width="200" height="200" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" /><a href="http://cashmusic.org/">CASH Music</a>, a nonprofit organization that builds "open tools and services to benefit artists and music organizations", recently launched its first fundraiser in conjunction with a number of amazing artists and labels. An <a href="http://cashmusic.org/">online raffle</a> is at the core of their efforts with some incredible prizes available ranging from signed sheet music to vinyl test pressings to to an in-studio performance for 10 people. </p>
<p>Participating artists include <strong>Kristin Hersh</strong>, <strong>Deerhoof</strong>, <strong>Mission of Burma</strong>, <strong>MGMT</strong>, <strong>Xiu Xiu</strong>, <strong>Mayer Hawthorne</strong>, and <strong>Portugal The Man</strong> to name a few. <a href="http://cashmusic.org/">Additional ways</a> to donate come in the form of limited edition prints, a fundraiser t-shirt, and of course by donating directly to CASH.</p>
<p>We have talked about CASH <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7896">numerous</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8509">times</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13219">before</a> (including <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8602">an interview</a> with Executive Director Jesse Von Doom) about how they use CC to create openness and facilitate sharing within their projects.

<p>Also, speaking of fundraisers, don't forget that CC is in the midst of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18166">our own</a>. Help us reach our $500,000 goal - <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate"><strong>any and all support</strong></a> is appreciated. And if you donate over $75, you'll be a proud owner of a very cool Shepard Fairey designed CC t-shirt!</p>
