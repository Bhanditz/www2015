<p><a href="http://sxsw.com/">SXSW</a>, the popular music-interactive-film mega-conference in Austin Texas has launched their <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/">interactive panel picker</a>. Eric and I proposed a number of panels that we think would make for good sessions. But we need your help to make them happen in 2009. Please visit the panel picker, read our panel descriptions, and create an account to vote for them! </p>
<p>Here are the direct links to our proposed panels for your clicking pleasure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1100">DRM: The Fight Isn't Over Yet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1101">Did You Get Ripped Off? Understanding Appropriation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1099">Dusty Jackets: Does Anyone Buy Physical Media Anymore?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1102">Non-Profit Technology Work: How You Can Do Good</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, mark your calendars for March 13th-17th and we'll see you there.</p>
