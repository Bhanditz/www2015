<p>Last night <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10837">I had</a> the pleasure of attending <a href="http://www.artknowsnoborders.com/">Art Knows No Borders</a>, an event that was both a fundraiser for <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> and a release party for <em><a href="http://bombardirovka.com/home.html">Bombardirovka</a></em>, a book written by Crystal Allen Cook in 2004 while she was in Armenia on a <a href="http://www.cies.org/about_fulb.htm">Fulbright Scholarship</a>. The novel is a work of fiction that, in the words of Cook, functions "to observe, up close, how the past, not necessarily even our own personal past, lives on the actions and bodies of people living in the present."</p>
