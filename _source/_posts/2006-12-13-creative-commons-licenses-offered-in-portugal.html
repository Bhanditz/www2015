<p><strong>San Francisco, CA, USA; Berlin, GERMANY; and Lisbon, Portugal â€” December 13, 2006</strong> â€” Creative Commons, a nonprofit dedicated to building a body of creative work free to share and build upon, is proud to announce the celebration of the launch of its licenses in Portugal on December 15, 2006.</p>
<p>Creative Commons copyright licenses are available free of charge from the groupâ€™s <a href="http://creativecommons.org">website</a>. The licenses allow authors and artists to mark their works as free to copy or transform under certain conditionsâ€”to declare â€œsome rights reserved,â€ in contrast to the traditional â€œall rights reservedâ€â€”thereby enabling others to access a growing pool of raw materials without legal friction.</p>
<p>Staff at Creative Commonsâ€™ offices in San Francisco and Berlin worked with the project leads Pedro Oliveira, JosÃ© Rui Felizardo and Pedro Ferreira in Portugal to adapt the standardized licenses to Portuguese law. The team has also been supported by Filipa Salazar Leite from the law firm Simmons & Simmons in Lisbon. Creative Commons Portugal was hosted by <a href="http://www.fcee.lisboa.ucp.pt/">FCEE-Universidade CatÃ³lica</a>, <a href="http://www.inteli.pt/site/inteli_home_00.asp?home=1">INTELI - Intelligence in Innovation</a> and <a href="http://www.infosociety.gov.pt/">UMIC - Knowledge Society Agency</a>.</p>
<p>With the availability of the Creative Commons licenses in Portugal, one of the largest and most prestigious daily newspapers in Portugal, PÃºblico, released articles under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 2.5 license, both online and in the paper edition.</p>
<p>The launch of the licenses will be celebrated by a series of events including a conference on â€˜The Future of Intellectual Propertyâ€™ to be held on Dec 15th 2006 at FCEE-CatÃ³lica in Lisbon. Professor Lawrence Lessig, CEO & Chairman of Creative Commons, will be the keynote speaker.<br />

<p><strong>About Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative re-use of intellectual and artistic worksâ€”whether owned or in the public domain. Creative Commons licenses provide a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors, artists, and educators that build upon the "all rights reserved" concept of traditional copyright to offer a voluntary "some rights reserved" approach. It is sustained by the generous support of various organizations including the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Omidyar Network, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as members of the public.
