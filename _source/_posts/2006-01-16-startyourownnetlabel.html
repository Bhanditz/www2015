<p>The first <em>Black Sweater White Cat</em> of the year is an all-<a href="http://www.comfortstand.com">Comfort Stand</a> program -- two hours featuring <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2006/01/bswc-comfort-stand-special-with.html">twenty Comfort Stand tracks and an extended interview</a> with <a href="http://www.otisfodder.com/">Otis Fodder</a> and <a href="http://www.comfortstand.com/catalog/001/mrmelvis.html">Mr. Melvis</a>, two of the netlabel's musician-operators. If you don't want to hear about how great Creative Commons and the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/netlabels">Internet Archive</a> are, or be at least a little bit inspired to start your own CC-licensed netlabel, do not <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/bswc12312005/BSWC12312005.mp3">listen</a>.</p>
<p><em>BSWC</em> is a weekly program, so there have already been two additional shows this year. The <a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2006/01/audio-file-for-11406.html">most recent show</a> (<a href="http://biotic.blogspot.com/2006/01/bswc-artist-playlist-for-011406.html">playlist</a>) is particularly excellent. It's really cool to see CC music programs feeding off each other:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many thanks to Grant<br />
Robertson and his new project, <a href="http://indieish.com/category/features/creative-commons-three-sixty-five/">CC365.</a><br />
CC365 is providing a real service to both the musicians and fans of the<br />
CC music community. This program features three songs from his second<br />
week. I have two computers subscribed to his feed. Check it out...there<br />
are 350 tunes left in 2006.</p></blockquote>
