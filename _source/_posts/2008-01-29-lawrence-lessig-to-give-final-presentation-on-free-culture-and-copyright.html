<p><strong>Lawrence Lessig to Give Final Presentation on Free Culture and Copyright</strong></p>
<p><strong>San Francisco, CA, USA â€” January 29, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons founder and Stanford professor Lawrence Lessig will give his final presentation on free culture, copyright, and the future of ideas at Stanford's Memorial Auditorium on January 31st, 2008 at 1pm. After 10 years of enlightening and inspiring audiences around the world with multimedia presentations that inspired the Free Culture movement, Professor Lessig is moving on from the copyright debate and setting his sights on corruption in Washington.</p>
<p>The presentation is being recorded for the upcoming feature film <em>Basement Tapes: The Making of a Pirate Movie</em>, a documentary about copyright in the digital age (see <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org">http://www.opensourcecinema.org</a>). Over four years in the making, the film is co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada and the award-winning production house EyeSteelFilm.</p>
