The NY Times has an interesting story of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/07/movies/07POTT.html">a new movie project called Wizard People, Dear Reader</a>. It's a derivative work where the first Harry Potter movie plays while artist Brad Neely creates his own soundtrack to the film. It falls into a gray area of law and Warner Brothers declined to comment on it.</p>
<p>
If you can't make it out to one of the live shows, the Illegal Art site <a href="http://illegal-art.org/video/wizard.html">has the soundtrack available for download</a>, which you can set up to watch at home if you have a copy of the Harry Potter DVD.</p>
