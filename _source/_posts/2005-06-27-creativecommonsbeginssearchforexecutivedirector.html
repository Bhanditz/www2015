<p>As many may already know, our resident project guru, Neeru Paharia will be leaving us in the fall to pursue her PhD at Harvard University. While we all will miss Neeru and the vision she brought to Creative Commons, we are happy to see her continue her goals in the world of academia. Good luck Neeru! Neeru's departure creates a vacancy at Executive Director for which we will begin a candidate search immediately. Job qualifications and a description can be found in our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities">opportunites</a> page.</p>
