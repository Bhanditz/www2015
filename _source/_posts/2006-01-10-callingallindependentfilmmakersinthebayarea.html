<p><The <a href="http://www.bavc.org/">Bay Area Video Coalition</a>, <a href="http://www.itvs.org/">Independent Television Service</a> and the <a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/">Center for Social Media</a> are hosting an <a href="http://www.bavc.org/email/fair_use/index.htm">event</a> on Friday February 24, 2006 on the topic of "What Fair Use Really Means For Independent Filmmakers." Promising to expose the "secret side" a copyright law, the event includes a showing of Untold Stories, a short video produced at American University â€™s Center for Social Media about the problem of rights clearance for documentary filmmakers, and a discussion with filmmakers, programmers, and legal experts about such topics as: Whatâ€™s â€œfairâ€ in quoting or appropriating something without paying for it? What are the implications of Fair Use on freedom of expression and distribution? How can I reduce production and legal costs and follow the law? How do I deal with the exploitation of my material? What is the best way to navigate the law safely?"
<p>Panelists will include:<a href="http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/staff.html">Patricia Aufderheide, Director, Center for Social Media</a>, American University; <a href="http://www.eff.org/about/staff/">Fred Von Lohmann, Senior Staff Attorney, Electronic Frontier Foundation</a><a>; </a><a href="http://www.namac.org/category.cfm?id=6&cid=52&monly=0">Jack Walsh, independent filmmaker and Co-Director, National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture</a>; Donald Young, Director of Broadcast Programming, <a href="http://asianamericanmedia.org/">Center for Asian American Media</a>; Claire Aguilar, Director of Programming, <a href="http://www.itvs.org/">Independent Television Service</a>. Wendy from BVAC tells me that the event is free and no registration required.
