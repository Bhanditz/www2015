<p>After nearly two years working with to support our community and forward Creative Commons in Europe, our European Regional Coordinator, Jonas &#214;berg, will be leaving us at the end of the month. Jonas has been awarded a <a href="http://jonasoberg.net/post/38250015637/joining-the-shuttleworth-foundation">prestigious fellowship from the Shuttleworth Foundation</a> to further his research into metadata standards for open materials. We will be very sad to lose Jonas, who has done a wonderful job of promoting CC and open in general over the last few years, and has worked tirelessly to support our European affiliates in their work. Europe is CC's biggest region, with 37 affiliates stretching from Ireland and the UK all the way through Kazakhstan and Russia - so the job isn't easy.</p>
<p>The good news is that Jonas won't be going far, with his Shuttleworth work likely to keep him a constant face in our community.</p>
<p>The other good news is that this opens up a new position for someone to work with Creative Commons in Europe. You can find the full position description <a href="http://creativecommons.org/opportunities#rceurope">here</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, our European Regional Coordinator works to â€œAssist Creative Commons and the CC Global Network team with organizational planning, strategic communications, community building, and fundraising in Europe in support of the organizationâ€™s mission, goals and objectives.â€ This means running events, coordinating collaborative projects, and generally assisting our European affiliates to build and grow their community. We also expect that 2013 in Europe will see a lot of work with local organisations advocating for the adoption and implementation of open policies in the region, particularly in the fields of government and educational materials. </p>
<p>If you have an interest in community management, open access, and Creative Commons, and live in or have ties to Europe, weâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>
