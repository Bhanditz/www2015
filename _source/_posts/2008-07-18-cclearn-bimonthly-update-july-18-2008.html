<p>June slipped by before we knew what was happening, so this is a two-month update. These past two months have seen ccLearn giving a presentation at CSU Sacramento relating <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ahrashb/cclearn-and-universal-design-29-may-2008">open education and universal design</a>, attending the first <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18">CC tech summit</a>, and plowing along on the various projects already underway. Also, we welcomed a summer intern,<a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#99"> Grace Armstrong</a>, who is coordinating with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/international/">CCi</a> and open education leaders in Latin America and beyond on holding meetings and identifying promising collaborative opportunities. More on this later this summer.</p>
<p>We have also released a great mapping tool for identifying upcoming open educational events, now found on <a href="http://learn.creativecommons.org/">ccLearn's home page</a>. What is unique about this tool is that the data are derived from a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Open_Education_Events">wiki-table</a>, and anyone can contribute or edit event info. We encourage you to add any events relevant to open education that you may be aware of. We intend to re-purpose this tool for other mapping exercises as well, and since it is open source, like everything Creative Commons builds, you can also use it for your own mapping needs. One idea that has already been discussed is "mapping the open educational space" at the upcoming <a href="http://icommonssummit.org/">iSummit</a>... this exercise could take many forms, and the open, collaborative nature of the wiki allows for a lot of creativity in how the map takes shape.</p>
<p>Look for other developments and research projects to come to fruition in the coming month. The days are getting shorter here in the Northern Hemisphere, but the fire season has just begun.</p>
