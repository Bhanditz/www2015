<p>It recently came to our attention that <a href="http://www.coke.com">Coca-Cola</a> relaunched their <a href="http://facebook.com/cocacola">Facebook Page</a> (apparently one of the largest pages on the social network, with over 3.6 million fans), and included a policy that content shared by fans be available under our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license</a>.  The specific CC license badge <a href="http://www.facebook.com/cocacola?v=wall&viewas=121130">appears in the sidebar on the Coke wall</a>, but is also referenced in <a href="http://assets.facebook.coca-cola.com/ccfbtou/">the Coca-Cola Facebook Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that Coke is using a Facebook App called <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=4949752878&ref=s">Static FBML</a> that helps Page administrators include arbitrary HTML in Facebook pages.  Since this is such a good idea, I'm going to work on a new version of our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=14563">Official Unofficial CC License Facebook application</a> that will enable all Page administrators to add CC license policies to their pages. More on that later this week.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a great step forward for encouraging CC content and choices on Facebook, so kudos to Coke for thinking about user generated content in the right way!</p>
