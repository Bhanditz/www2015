<p>I delivered a talk on Creative Commons's international efforts yesterday at the conference of European Cultural Heritage Online. The conference took place in the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, Germany. ECHO is an EU-funded  collaborative research endeavour that provides support for scientific and cultural institutions in Europe that enrich cultural heritage through new technologies. Some of these partners (such as a state library in Lower Saxony specializing in Leibniz manuscripts dating from the 17th century or an online museum on the Fontana di Trevi) have articulated a strong interest in using the CC licences for making their collections digitally available. Thanks again to the Max Planck Institute for inviting us.</p>
