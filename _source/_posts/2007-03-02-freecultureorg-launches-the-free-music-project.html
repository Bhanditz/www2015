<p>The very good people of FreeCulture.org have launched a new website called the <a href="http://freemusic.freeculture.org">Free Music Project</a>, where people can upload music available for free and legal sharing and remix. The site is working with the <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">One Laptop per Child</a> project; selected songs will be included on OLPC laptops to be distributed to children in the developing world.</p>
<blockquote><p>"This is a groundbreaking opportunity to locate the best free music out there and share it with millions of people of all ages around the world," said Elizabeth Stark, board member of Freeculture.org and founder of the Free Culture group at Harvard. "Freely licensing recordings allows artists to gain extremely valuable global exposure through projects such as OLPC."</p></blockquote>
