From <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> musician <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/">Brad Sucks</a>, comes his new music industry blog <a href="http://www.selloutcentral.com/">Sellout Central</a>, which he is co-authoring. They're exploring a variety of legal and artist issues in the industry and their first slew of posts gives any musician plenty to chew on. We'll be watching this new blog closely.</p>
