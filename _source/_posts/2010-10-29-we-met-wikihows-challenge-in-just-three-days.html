<p>We're thrilled to announce that we've met wikiHow's challenge to match the next $4000 donated to CC's <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">fundraising campaign</a> in just three days! <strong>THANK YOU to all who donated</strong> and had your gift automatically doubled by <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">wikiHow</a>, the world's largest and highest quality how-to manual! </p>
<p>By joining wikiHow in supporting CC, you're confirming their belief that CC is a cause worth caring about. According to wikiHow founder Jack Herrick, "wikiHow is all about enabling people to share and learn: Our contributors share their knowledge with us and then we bring their expertise to the largest possible audience. This works so well because of Creative Commons. Supporting this organization ensures that the tools to share and build upon knowledge will be maintained as the electronic age continues to evolve."</p>
<p>Now's your chance to also check out these awesome new additions to the world of wikiHow instructions: How to support <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Donate-to-Creative-Commons">Creative Commons</a>; How to support <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Support-the-Free-Culture-Movement">Free Culture</a>; and how to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Look-for-Freely-Licensed-Images-on-Google">find CC licensed images</a>.</p>
<p>If you didn't have the chance to take part in the challenge, you can still help us meet our $550k goal by <a href="http://www.creativecommons.net/donate">donating today</a> and showing the world how much sharing means to you.</p>
