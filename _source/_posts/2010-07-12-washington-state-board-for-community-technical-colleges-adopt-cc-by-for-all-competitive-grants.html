<p>The <a href="http://www.sbctc.edu/">Washington State Board for Community &amp; Technical Colleges</a> (SBCTC) recently adopted an open licensing policy for the competitive grants they administer:</p>
<blockquote><p>All digital software, educational resources and knowledge produced through competitive grants, offered through and/or managed by the SBCTC, will carry a Creative Commons Attribution License ... [and] applies to all funding sources (state, federal, foundation and/or other fund sources) ...</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sbctc.edu/general/admin/Tab_9_Open_Licensing_Policy.pdf">brief</a> (PDF), prepared by Cable Green (who we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/20828">interviewed</a> in March about the <a href="http://opencourselibrary.wikispaces.com/">Open Course Library Project</a>), explains how the policy is aligned with SBCTC's strategic technology plan. The policy draws inspiration from related initiatives working to support the sharing of research and OER, such as the <a href="http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/issues/frpaa/index.shtml">Federal Research Public Access Act</a> (FRPAA), the Southern Regional Education Board's openness recommendations via <a href="http://www.sreb.org/cgi-bin/MySQLdb?VIEW=/public/docs/view_one.txt&amp;docid=1317">"An Expectation of Sharing: Guidelines for Effective Policies to Respect, Protect and Increase the Use of Digital Educational Resources"</a>, and the open licensing requirements for foundation grantees explored in the Berkman Center'sÂ <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2009/Open_Content_Licensing_for_Foundations">"An Evaluation of Private Foundation Copyright Licensing Policies, Practices and Opportunities."</a></p>
<p>Congratulations to SBCTC for this great step forward!</p>
