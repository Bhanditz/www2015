<p>From the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/archives/2007/04/30/copyright-fair-use-in-the-blogosphere/">blog</a>:</p>

Batts soon took down the figures, reproduced the data in an Excel format, and avoided legal penalty.</p>
<p>Her experience raises a larger question, though. In the world of blogging where cutting and pasting is common practice, how do copyright and fair use laws apply? Katherine Sharpe addressed this very question on ScienceBlogs, calling on Springer Publishing's Johannes Velterop and Science Commons' John Wilbanks to comment. [...]</p></blockquote>
