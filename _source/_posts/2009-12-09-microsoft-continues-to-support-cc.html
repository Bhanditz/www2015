<p>Since 2005 Microsoft has been an ongoing supporter of CC -- including putting our campaign over the top last year -- and we're very happy to announce that they are helping to jumpstart our 2009 campaign with a donation of $25,000. </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/profile/tom-rubin">Tom Rubin</a>, Microsoft's Chief Counsel for Intellectual Property Strategy, â€œCreative Commons is an exciting and vital part of the ecosystem of creativity.  Microsoft is very pleased to continue to support its efforts.â€</p>
<p>The support of Microsoft and other computing industry heavyweights is a key indicator that CC is seen as important infrastructure for the future of the network, for business as well as for the arts, education and science. If you too believe  CC is an essential component to participatory culture, please join Microsoft in <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate">donating to CC</a>. </p>
<p>Thank you to Microsoft and everyone else who has invested in the future of creativity and knowledge by <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org">supporting CC!</a> </p>
