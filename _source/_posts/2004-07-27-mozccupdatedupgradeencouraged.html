<p>I've just released an upgrade to mozCC.  Everyone's encouraged to upgrade, as this release fixes an embarassing bug which caused Mozilla and Firefox to lock up under certain situations (say, choosing a Creative Commons license).  You can find the release annoucement and installation/upgrade instructions <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc/news">here</a>.</p>
<p>Find another bug?  Have a suggestion?  <a href="http://yergler.net/projects/mozcc/contact">Let me know!</a></p>
