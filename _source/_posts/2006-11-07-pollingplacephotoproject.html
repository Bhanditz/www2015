<p>It is election day in the United States jurisdiction.  The <a href="http://pollingplacephotoproject.org">Polling Place Photo Project</a> aims to use mass citizen journalism to document democracy:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The Polling Place Photo Project is a nationwide experiment in citizen journalism that seeks to empower citizens to capture, post and share photographs of democracy in action. By documenting their local voting experience on November 7, voters can contribute to an archive of photographs that captures the richness and complexity of voting in America.</p>
<p>With citizens' images and the information that accompanies them, the Project becomes a research tool on how voting happens in America and how it can be designed to be easier, less confusing and more enjoyable. The project intends to collect photographs of every polling place in America, so you are encouraged to participate no matter where you vote, how large or small your polling place is, what kind of ballot you use, or what your party affiliation.</p>
