<p>As a digital creator, you have a vested interest in both the future of your work and the larger participatory culture. As an active participant in this community, you play a major role in helping ensure that our culture remains as free and accessible as possible.</p>
<p>Because of this, we are releasing our own <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/widget">fundraising widget</a>. This is an exciting move for CC, as we're putting faith in the power of "you" to help us raise awareness and funds for CC's future.</p>
<p>The widget is an easy-to-use tool that embeds in your blog, website, or Myspace page. The text is customizable so you can encourage people to support CC in your own words.</p>
<p>Remember â€“ by <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">supporting Creative Commons</a>, you are enabling us to continue doing innovative work that builds and supports an accessible, shareable, and reusable culture.</p>
