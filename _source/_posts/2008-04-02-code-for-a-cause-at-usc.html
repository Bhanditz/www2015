<p>Two weeks ago, I met David Hodge, a freshman at the University of Southern California. He has been working with  <a href="http://imlportfolio.usc.edu/freeculture/">USC Free Culture</a> (part of <a href="http://freeculture.org/">Students for Free Culture</a>) and the <a href="http://pollux.usc.edu/~acm/">USC Association for Computing Machinery chapter</a> to run a week-long programming competition to build software for OLPC's XO laptop.  That project is "<a href="http://codeforacause.net/">Code for a Cause</a>."</p>
<p>He had asked me if he could borrow one of the development XO laptops Creative Commons has. I agreed, and before that day was over he snapped this photo behind his house (by him; available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">by-sa 3.0</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/img_0508.JPG" title="img_0508_small.JPG"><img src="img/img_0508_small.JPG" alt="img_0508_small.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Code for a Cause explains more <a href="http://codeforacause.net/">on its website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The OLPC is the famed "$100 laptop" that is being sent to the world's poorest children to give them a chance for education. In the OLPC Hackathon, teams of USC students will design open-source software that can be used on the OLPC laptops being distributed worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if you're in the LA area, check out their information session on April 9, and get started at their orientation on April 12!</p>
