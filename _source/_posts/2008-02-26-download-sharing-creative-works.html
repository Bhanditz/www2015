<p>A PDF of <em>Sharing Creative Works</em>, the latest CC comic book, is now available for <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/comics/sharingcreativeworks/sharingcreativeworks.pdf">download</a>. This new format is easier to read and share than the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Sharing_Creative_Works">wiki</a> version we published a couple months ago, and is ready to print. <em>Sharing Creative Works</em> is a colorful, easy-to-understand introduction to some of the abstract concepts behind Creative Commons. </p>
<p><img src="img/sharing_creative_works_img-12.png" alt="Sharing Creative Works p. 12" /></p>
<p>In keeping with its theme, <em>Sharing Creative Works</em> is in the public domain. To encourage remixes and translations, all of the original SVG files, the text of the script, high quality PNG files, and the <a href="http://www.scribus.net/">Scribus</a> document used to generate the PDF are also <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/comics/sharingcreativeworks/sharingcreativeworks.zip">available</a>. Changes to the official version can still be made on its <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Sharing_Creative_Works">wiki</a> page; thanks to everyone who already contributed edits and feedback!</p>
<p>Created by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#51">Alex Roberts</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#78">Rebecca Rojer</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#53">Jon Phillips</a>, <em>Sharing Creative Works</em> features a new visual style from our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Comics">previous comics</a>. We hope you find it a helpful resource for explaining the basics of copyright and CC licensing to kids and adults alike. A customized version will also serve as documentation for the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Creative_Commons">OLPC Licensing Activity</a>, keep an eye out for more info in the near future. </p>
<p>Please download, share, and remix <a href="http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/comics/sharingcreativeworks/sharingcreativeworks.pdf">Sharing Creative Works</a>!</p>
