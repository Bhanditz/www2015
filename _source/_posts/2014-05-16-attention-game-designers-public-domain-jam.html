<p>If you're a videogame designer and you have nothing to do over the next week (or if making cool games is more fun than your day job), why not spend the week developing a public domain game?</p>
<p>The idea of <a href="http://itch.io/jam/the-public-domain-jam">The Public Domain Jam</a> is to encourage developers to create games based on public domain assets and stories, and optionally give the games themselves back to the public domain via the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 waiver</a>. The game trailer encourages designers to think about the amazing wealth of public domain source material: maybe in the next week, Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> will dethrone zombies as the most important source of game design inspiration in the public domain.</p>

<p>The contest is being organized by game developer <a href="https://twitter.com/gritfish">Gritfish</a>, and fellow game developer <a href="https://twitter.com/ncasenmare">Nick Liow</a> is sponsoring a $1000 prize for the best CC0 game.</p>
<p>If you recognize Nick's name, it might be because <a href="/weblog/entry/38768">I interviewed him last year</a> about his <a href="http://open.commonly.cc/">Open Game Art Bundle</a>. Since then, he's released his own crowdfunded CC0 game, <a href="https://back.nothingtohide.cc/">Nothing to Hide</a>.</p>
<p>Hurry! <a href="http://itch.io/jam/the-public-domain-jam">The Public Domain Jam ends May 24</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update (June 9):</strong> The judges have selected the best CC0 game, <a href="http://danman9914.itch.io/paper-jekyll">Paper Jekyll</a>. It's a really interesting take on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde"><em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em></a>. Check it out! Congratulations to everyone who built a game.</p>
