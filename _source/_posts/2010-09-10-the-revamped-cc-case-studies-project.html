<p>Last year, we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14392">kicked off</a> our global case studies effort, inviting you to share your stories---individuals, projects, and companies who use Creative Commons for different reasons and to solve different problems. Through the CC wiki, we attempted to capture the diversity of CC creators and content by building a resource that inspires new works and informs free culture.</p>
<p>Thanks to your contributions, the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies project</a> has grown into an incredibly valuable resource. But like all wikis, the Case Studies wiki is evolving. Everyday, more people and projects are using CC, and existing projects are continuously making themselves over.</p>
<p>To keep up, we've made the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies project</a> easier to navigate and ultimately more useful and participatory for the community by revamping the portal and building a new rating system, implementing lessons we've learned from other successful wiki communities <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Measurement/Assessment">such as Wikipedia</a>. What's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>We used <a href="http://labs.creativecommons.org/2010/09/08/smw-case-study/">Semantic MediaWiki</a> (an extension of MediaWiki) to organize quantifiable elements into a few common properties. Take a look at the case study for <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> and you'll see a new box on the right that provides an at-a-glance view of some of the project's main properties. These properties are common to all case studies and their values can now be easily <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:BrowseData/Casestudy?_single">browsed</a>.</li>
<li>The ability to <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Evaluation">evaluate</a> each case study by Page Importance and Page Quality. We drafted an <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Evaluation#Evaluation_Guide">Evaluation Guide</a> with some basic criteria for what determines whether a case study is of high, medium, or low importance and quality. These criteria are meant to serve as starting points; we want you to edit and improve them as more case studies are evaluated and added. Each criteria that is not met comes with suggested edits to improve existing case studies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you can do now:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the revamped <a title="Case Studies" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">Case Studies wiki</a>!</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Evaluation">Evaluate</a> a Case Study</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Special:BrowseData/Casestudy?_single">Improve</a> a Case Study by adding relevant data, updating old information, or editing the prose so that it sparkles</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CcWiki:Translate">Translate</a> the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/Evaluation">new instructions</a>. See the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Pt:Casos_de_Estudo/Avalia%C3%A7%C3%A3o">Portuguese</a> translation of the evaluations page as an example.</li>
<li>And as always, <a title="Case Studies" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies">add</a> your CC story or one you're familiar with</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the new features is to encourage better quality and contribution. Please use and help us improve them!</p>
