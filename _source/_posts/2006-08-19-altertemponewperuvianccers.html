<p>In July we <a href="http://icommons.org/2006/07/11/a-reflection-on-the-ccperu-launch/">celebrated</a> the launch of the Peru version of the Creative Commons licenses.  And now, we are thrilled to see the release by the Peruvian duo <a href="http://www.altertempo.com/">Alter Tempo</a> of four singles: "Para estar contigo" (To be with you), "Gracias" (Thank you), "Tu voz en el viento" (Your voice in the wind) y "Libre" (Free), which can be streamed and downloaded for free in MP3 format directly from their <a href="http://www.altertempo.com">website</a> under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/pe/deed.es_CL">PaternitÃ© - Pas d'Utilisation Commerciale - Pas de Modification 2.5 Peru</a> (BY-NC-ND) license.</p>
<p>Alter Tempoâ€™s music is influenced by a wide range of styles such as Beatlesâ€™ styled rock, bolero, trova, jazz, heavy metal, gospel and a variety of latin grooves. The main theme of their songs is everyday love, â€œa feeling everyone experiences but no one can define with precisionâ€ says Roberto, one half of the duo.</p>
<p>Alter Tempo explained their decision to use CC licenses - "Creative Commons is the best way to share your music with freedom along the web but keeping also commercial control of your works."</p>
