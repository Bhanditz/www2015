<p>The <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>, known for its innovative, hands-on approaches in design, multimedia, and technology, has named Creative Commons Chairman and former CEO Joi Ito as its new executive director. In its article about the announcement, theÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/science/26lab.html">New York Times</a> notes Joi's long-time support of open culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Raised in both Tokyo and Silicon Valley, Mr. Ito was part of the first generation to grow up with the Internet. ...[Joi] was also an early participant in the open-source software movement and is a board member of the Mozilla Foundation, which oversees the development of the Firefox Web [browser], as well as being the co-founder and chairman of Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that has sought to create a middle ground to promote the sharing of digital information."</p></blockquote>
<p>Joi also <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2011/04/25/joining-the-mit.html">blogs</a> about his new appointment, describing MIT Media Lab as a great fit:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I really felt at home for the first time in many ways. It felt like a place where I could focus - focus on everything - but still have a tremendous ability to work with the team as well as my network and broader extended network to execute and impact the world in a substantial and positive way."</p></blockquote>
