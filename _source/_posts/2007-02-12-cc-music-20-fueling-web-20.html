<p>The title of this post is a subheading from a <a href="http://soundblog.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!D380EA83E108537F!2536.entry">great writeup of ccMixter's new playlist features at Dave's Imaginary Sound Space</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Make no mistake, ccMixter <em>is</em> the complete package. No other remix site commands the same level of respect amongst musicians, producers and content creators.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the <a href="http://soundblog.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!D380EA83E108537F!2536.entry">entire article</a> for a great overview, then check out <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/playlist/browse/44">100 CC BY hits</a>, a playlist put together by CC Creative Director Eric Steuer -- 100 great tracks licensed under CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Attribution</a> -- free permission granted for remix and commercial use.</p>
<p>Also check out Dave's post from early this month on <a href="http://soundblog.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D380EA83E108537F!2532.entry?_c=BlogPart">Creative Commons Video Sharing Sites and Social Media Tools</a>.</p>
<p>We've linked to Dave's extended writeups a couple times previously.  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/6162">What if The Beatles had used Creative Commons Licenses?</a> from November 2006 and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5485">Podsafe Music Making Sense</a> from June 2005 are still very much worth exploring.</p>
