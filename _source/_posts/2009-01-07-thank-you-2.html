<p>One week ago I <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11910">asked</a> for support in helping us reach our $500,000 goal. At that time, we had $12,000 left to raise with only 2 1/2 days left in the campaign, and we were all wondering how we were going to make it. Today, I'm proud to say that our community went above and beyond -- raising CC a grand total of $525,383.73.</p>
<p>I want to send a special thank you to all of the individuals and companies that are long time supporters of CC. We've had hundreds of people continue to support CC over the years and I wish I could thank each and everyone of you publicly for your continued support. However, I don't want to take up the entire CC main page, so please know how appreciated your commitment to CC is. To <a href="http://www.garage.co.jp/en/">Digital Garage</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href="http://www.tucows.com/">Tucows</a>, <a href="http://www.ce.org/">Consumer Electronics Association</a>, and <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">wikiHow</a>, thank you for your continued commitment to CC - I look forward to working with each of your companies in bringing more global awareness about CC, and I feel confident that together we will continue to enrich the digital commons we're all investing in.</p>
<p>And to all the new individuals and new corporate supporters (<a href="http://www.attributor.com/">Attributor</a>, <a href="http://dotasia.org/">DotAsia</a>, <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>, <a href="http://www.nevo.com/">Nevo Technologies</a>, <a href="http://www.nevo.com/">Safe Creative</a>) - thank you for choosing to support CC this year. CC is only as strong as the community that supports it and we're thrilled to see this community thriving. Think of all we can do over the next year by coming together and supporting each other.</p>
<p>I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the following companies and foundations who are committed to sustaining CC and the open movement. To <a href="http://www.hewlett.org">the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.macfound.org">the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://ietsi.org/">IETSI</a>, <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, and the <a href="http://www.omidyar.net/">Omidyar Network</a> - thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you all from the bottom of my (and the rest of the CC staff's) heart -- we know how difficult it is right now and are deeply honored that you would choose to <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">support CC</a> this year. This doesn't just help us continue our work but also reaffirms the growing strength of our community and the belief in a more fair and accessible digital world.</p>
<p>The CC staff, the board of directors, and I all look forward to what will surely be an exciting 2009.</p>
