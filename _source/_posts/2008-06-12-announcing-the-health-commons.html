<p>Over on the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org">Science Commons</a> <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/weblog/">blog</a>, <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/about/whoweare/wentworth/">Donna Wentworth</a> writes:</p>
<div style="30px;"><em>People make chairs more productively, hamburgers more productively, cars more productively, everything else in the world except medicines. -- Aled Edwards, Director and CEO of the <a title="Structural Genomics Consortium" href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/05/30/f-strauss-drugresearch.html" target="_blank">Structural Genomics Consortium</a> (via </em><em><a title="CBC News Canada" href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/05/30/f-strauss-drugresearch.html" target="_blank">CBC News Canada</a>)</em></div>
<p>The drug discovery process is badly broken. Despite the scientific and technological advances that make genetic decoding commonplace, the time it takes to go from gene target to cure still stands at 17 years.</p>
<p>Science Commons' mission is to speed the translation of basic research to useful discoveries, and we believe that a new approach is necessary to find more cures, faster. Today, we're opening up the <a title="Health Commons" href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/healthcommons/" target="_blank">Health Commons</a>, a project aimed at bringing the same efficiencies to human health that the network brought to commerce and culture.</p>
<p>The project, founded by Science Commons in collaboration with <a title="CommerceNet" href="http://www.commerce.net/" target="_blank">CommerceNet</a>, <a title="CollabRX" href="http://collabrx.com/" target="_blank">CollabRX</a> and the Public Library of Science (<a title="PLoS" href="http://www.plos.org/" target="_blank">PLoS</a>), is introduced in a 6-minute video presentation and white paper posted on the Science Commons website. The paper, <em><a title="Therapy Development in a Networked World" href="http://sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/health-commons-whitepaper-launch.pdf" target="_blank">Health Commons: Therapy Development in a Networked World</a></em> [PDF], is co-authored by John Wilbanks, Vice President of Science at Creative Commons, and Marty Tenenbaum, an Internet commerce pioneer and founder of CommerceNet and CollabRX.
