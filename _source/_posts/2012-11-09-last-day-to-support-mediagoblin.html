<p>If you follow Creative Commons' various social media outlets, you've probably heard us talking about <a href="http://mediagoblin.org/pages/campaign.html">GNU MediaGoblin's crowdfunding campaign</a>. Today is the last day to support the campaign, so we wanted to give it one last shout-out.</p>
<p>CC alumnus Chris Webber is MediaGoblin's lead developer. It's an open-source media-hosting platform. It's already CC-enabled, but Chris and his team have some exciting plans for its future, so they're running a funding campaign with the help of our friends at the Free Software Foundation. Watch the video to see what's on the horizon:</p>
