<p>Innovative content licensing seems to be catching on -- even beyond the efforts of Creative Commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phptr.com/">Prentince Hall PTR</a> recently announced that they'll publish a series of technical books under <a href="http://perens.com/Books/">open-content licenses</a>.  Read the <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/06/0134224&mode=thread&tid=156">Slashdot story</a>.</p>
<p>Kudos to <a href="http://perens.com/Books/">Bruce Perens</a> for brokering the move, and to <a href="http://www.phptr.com/">Prentice Hall</a> for joining <a href="http://oreilly.com">O'Reilly and Associaties</a> in the elite club of enlightened commercial publishers.</p>
<p>(You'll recall that the O'Reilly folks recently adopted our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/founderscopyright">Founder's Copyright</a>, under which they'll release certain copyrights into the public domain after 14 years, with an option to renew for another 14 -- just as the Framers' of the U.S. Constitution would have had it.)</p>
