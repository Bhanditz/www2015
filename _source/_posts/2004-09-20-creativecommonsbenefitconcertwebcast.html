<p>Thanks to the Ken and the team at <a href="http://smartleydunn.com/">Smartley-Dunn</a>, we're pleased to announce that our upcoming concert this Tuesday night in New York City will be webcast live from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">this page</a> (requires Apple's Quicktime player). Ticketmaster says the show is now sold out, and we won't be archiving the audio, but the concert will be streamed September 21st, live starting at 8PM EST. We want to thank Ken for putting it together, Wired, David Byrne, and Gilberto Gil for letting it happen, and Apple for hosting it all.</p>
