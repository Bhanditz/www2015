<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#13">Ben Adida</a>, one of our technical advisors, will be talking about Creative Commons at the <a href="http://www.dspace.org/conference/conference.html">DSpace User Meeting</a> on Thursday morning at MIT. He will demonstrate the integration of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">CC license selection process</a> into the DSpace application. Thanks to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/developerdocs">CC License Engine</a>, this development work can be done in a few hours, providing any web-based application with the full, always-up-to-date, selection of Creative Commons Licenses.</p>
