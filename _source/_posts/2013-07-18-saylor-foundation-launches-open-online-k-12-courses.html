<br />
The Saylor Foundation recently <a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/05/15/547492/10032944/en/Saylor-Foundation-Launches-Open-Online-K-12-Courses.html">launched</a> a new K-12 program on <a href="http://saylor.org/">Saylor.org</a>, debuting courses for grades 6-12 in English language arts and mathematics. A team of experienced educators and staff are developing courses fully aligned to the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">US Common Core State Standards</a>. Like Saylor's college-level courses, the K-12 program incorporates open educational resources (<a href="/education#OER">OER</a>), making the courses, as well as their contents, widely reusable by students, teachers, and parents nationwide. The course frameworks and instructions are available under a <a href="/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license</a>. Thus, while the courses are ready for use as-is, anyone may also reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute their courses to meet local needs.</p>
<p>Following its higher education model, Saylor's K-12 team focused on reviewing and vetting an existing pool of OER, selecting the best OER to develop instructions and learning outcomes. With Common Core standards providing a framework for each course, Saylor aims to make K-12 OER easy to find and use. Saylor is currently working on 18 additional courses which will be rolled out as they are completed.</p>
<h4>How can you use K-12 courses on <a href="http://saylor.org/">Saylor.org</a>?</h4>
<p>Teachers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching">Flip your classroom</a> without shooting your own videos. Saylor provides recommendations on their site.</li>
<li>Incorporate more engaging digital content in your class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get current, openly licensed, Common Core&#8211;aligned materials for free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide extra resources to supplement what your kids learn in school. </li>
<li>Use self-contained curriculum for home-schooling families.</li>
<li>Accelerate or review subjects with your kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do more challenging work. Your school might not offer calculus, but <a href="http://saylor.org/">Saylor.org</a> does!</li>
<li>Learn subjects in a different way and acclimate to an online learning environment.</li>
<li>Review material you learned in school.</li>
<li>Go further and prepare for your SATs/college (more on that on the site).</li>
