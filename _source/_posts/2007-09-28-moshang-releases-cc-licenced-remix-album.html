<p><a href="http://moshang.net/">Moshang</a>, a self-proclaimed sound jeweler, has just released a new remix album, <a href="http://asianvariations.com/default.html"><em>Asian Variations</em></a>, featuring 14 tracks of downtempo goodness. From <a href="http://moshang.net/">moshang.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MoShang is a sound jeweler living in Taiwan. He collects rough audio diamonds from the streets of Taiwan (be they overheard conversations, street-ads blared from the ubiquitous blue-trucks, street processions or funeral chants) and fuses them with traditional Chinese instruments and laid-back beats to create a unique blend of downtempo electronica he likes to call Chinese Chill.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Asian Variations</em> builds out of this aesthetic, "produced by MoShang in his Chinese Chill style of downtempo electronica, melding deeply laid-back beats with Chinese traditional instruments". It is a wonder to listen to, and, as the album is released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed-music">CC Music Sharing License</a>, simple to share with your friends and family. Head over to the <a href="http://asianvariations.com/download.html"><em>Asian Variations</em> website</a> to download the album in its entirety, for free.</p>
