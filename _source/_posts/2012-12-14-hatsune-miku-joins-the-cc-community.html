<p><em>"Hatsune Miku has inspired thousands of people to create their own musical recordings and remixes. It's fitting that she'd become CC-licensed, joining forces with a movement that lives to make sharing and remixing easier. I'm thrilled to welcome to welcome Hatsune to the ranks of CC-licensed works."</em><br />&#8211;Catherine Casserly, Creative Commons CEO</p>
<p><em>"Cryptonâ€™s Hatsune Miku is an amazingly unique, inspiring and successful example of how sharing pulls together in community to empowers and explosion of creativity. It's one of my favorite projects. I'm so excited that Creative Commons can now be part of that story."</em><br />&#8211;Joi Ito, Creative Commons board member, Director at the MIT Media Lab</p>

<p>In celebration of the <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/">tenth anniversary of Creative Commons</a>, we are happy to announce that <a href="http://piapro.net/en_for_creators.html">Hatsune Miku has joined the CC community!</a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a> is the first and most famous virtual singer. What sets Miku apart from other "characters" is the original "remix-free" license for users. Since her debut in 2007, Miku have been remixed and cherished by fans, resulting in 170,000+ videos on YouTube, 95,000 songs, and 500,000+ artworks created by the community.</p>
<p>Hatsune Miku also played the major role at TOYOTA USA and Google Chrome TV commercials. She has performed sold-out shows with 3D images not only in Japan, but also in Los  Angeles, Hong Kong, Taipei, and Singapore. To deal with growing demands from the world, Crypton Future Media Inc., which gave a birth to Hatsune Miku and owes her character, has decided to adopt the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC BY-NC</a> license on December 14th.</p>
<p><em>"The creative culture using Hatsune Miku and related community will spread worldwide by applying a CC license to the illustration of Hatsune Miku. I hope that this encourages cross-border collaborations among creators and enables them to deepen their understanding of each other's culture and respect to creators through their works and creation."</em><br />&#8211;Hiroyuki Ito, CEO of Crypton Future Media, Inc.</p>
