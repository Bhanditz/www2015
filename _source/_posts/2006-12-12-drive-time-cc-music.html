<p>You know that CC licensing is reaching far into the music scene when you have a genre-specific region based podcast like the <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzequj8b/nyneregionaledmshowcase/">NY-NE Regional EDM Showcase</a>. In yet another example of what is enabled by CC licenses this show featuresÂ "original EDM tracks from independent musicians within upstate New York And Western New England" all CC licensed." (<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzequj8b/nyneregionaledmshowcase/id3.html">mission statement</a>). The show itself is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">Attribution NonCommercial NoDerivs</a> and each song in each song in the "Commute-Size" mixes are under various CC licenses.</p>
<p>The latest is <a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzequj8b/nyneregionaledmshowcase/id2.html">Commute - Size Mixes Vol. IV - Breakbeat</a>Â with previous volumes specializing in Trance, Progressive and DnB.</p>
<p>If you live in the right part of the world, make the right kind of music and of course, license your music under CC, you can even submit files directly (<a href="http://mysite.verizon.net/vzequj8b/nyneregionaledmshowcase/id1.html">terms and instructions here</a>).</p>
