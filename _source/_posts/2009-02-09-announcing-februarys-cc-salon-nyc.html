<p>Creative Commons Salons in NYC have been building momentum and it is now time for our February salon. Come out to have some beers with the CC community (don't worry, we'll open it up early this time) watch some cool presentations, and meet some new faces in the free culture space. Since we've outgrown our original space, The Open Planning project, February's Salon is back at <a href="http://www.foryourimagination.com">For Your Imagination</a>'s loft space. </p>
<p>February's Salon will feature presentations by <a href="http://www.thinginverse.com"><strong>Bre Pettis on Thingiverse.com</strong></a>'s CC integration, <a href="http://www.blip.tv/"><strong>blip.tv's CEO Mike Hudack</strong> demoing new features of the CC-friendly video site</a>, and <strong>co-CEOs Dan Zaccagnino and Matt Siegel from <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">Indaba Music</a></strong>, talking about <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/sessions/indaba/68873">their recent work</a> on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/?p=12374">Colbert v. Lessig</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvvhDngERXo">remix shenanigans</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
