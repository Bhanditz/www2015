<p>We hope you'll join us tomorrow evening at our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12332">CC Salon SF</a> from 7-9pm at <a href="http://parisoma.com">PariSoMa</a>, located at 1436 Howard Street, San Francisco (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1436+howard+street,+san+francisco,+ca&sll=37.770986,-122.419624&sspn=0.042743,0.055361&ie=UTF8&ll=37.773802,-122.414839&spn=0.010685,0.01384&z=16&iwloc=addr">map and directions</a>). You'll get the chance to meet <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/">the entire CC staff</a> and hear about our latest projects on the international scene and in education, science, and culture. There will also be time for questions and discussion. Whether you've been a fan of CC from the start or you're new to the world of free culture, this salon is not to be missed! Light refreshments will be provided.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: The space is located up two steep flights of stairs, so if anyone is in need of elevator access, there is a freight elevator we can use. You will just need to buzz up when you arrive and let someone know. </p>
<p>We rely on the generosity of our community to keep us afloat, so we'll be accepting donations for CC at the door. If you didn't get a chance to <a href="http://support.creativecommons.org">support us</a> during our fundraising campaign, now is your chance. </p>
<p><strong>CC Salons are global events, and anyone can start one</strong>, no matter where you live. We encourage you to check out our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon#Resources_for_starting_your_own_CC_Salon">resources for starting your own salon</a> in your area.</p>
