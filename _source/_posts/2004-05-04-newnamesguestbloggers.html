<p>You may have noticed some new names on our blog of late. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#27">Roland Honekamp</a>, an Internet entrepreneur in Germany, recently joined Creative Commons as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#18">Christiane Asschenfeldt</a>'s right-hand-man at <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/">iCommons</a> HQ in Berlin. <a href="http://ubuntu.typepad.com/about.html">Heather Ford</a>, a <a href="http://reuters.stanford.edu/">Reuters Digital Vision</a> Fellow here at Stanford, is helping lead iCommons Africa's development, with a focus on South Africa, her home. <a href="http://fourstones.net/">Victor Stone</a>, who submitted tracks to our Remix contest last year, has joined as an occasional guest blogger on matters of music and bricolage. And last but certainly not least, Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/getcontent/features/doctorow">poster boy</a> Cory Doctorow -- <a href="http://boingboing.net">blogger</a>, <a href="http://eff.org">EFF activist</a>, and <a href="http://craphound.com/">award-winning science fiction author</a> -- is now Creative Commons' <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#26">advisor on iCommons UK</a>. (Cory liked us so much -- and we, him -- that he joined the company.)</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more guest-blogging. In the meantime, welcome our new friends.</p>
