<p>A little late on the blogging (due to travel), but still worth reporting on:</p>
<p>
A few weeks ago, I was lucky enough to attend the <a href="http://freeculture2.typepad.com/free_culture_phase_2/">Free Culture Phase 2 conference</a>.  The conference was organized by Malkia Lydia and Colin Mutchler (father of Creative Commons' theme song <a href="http://ccmixter.org/file/commonsplice/1">My Life</a> and <a href="http://www.activefreemedia.org/tour/">Free Culture Tour</a>), and sponsored by <a href="http://www.american.edu/index_mac.html">American University</a>. It brought together a small number of diverse younger and older activists, including <a href="http://freeculture.org">Freeculture.org</a>, <a href="http://downhillbattle.org">Downhill Battle</a>, <a href="http://www.listenup.org">Listen Up</a>, <a href="http://www.cultureisaweapon.org/">Third World Majority</a>, <a href="http://eyebeam.org">Eyebeam</a>, and  many more.  The diverse group struggled to understand what free culture truly means in the context of global economics, access to technology, and traditional knowledge.  The group also shared ideas, art, and experiences using new media as a tool for social justice.  Though it wasn't clearly defined what Phase 2 might be, it was understood to me that the root of what everyone was doing came from a common passion for citizen self-determination and empowerment. </p>
