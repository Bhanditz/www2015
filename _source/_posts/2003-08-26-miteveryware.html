<p>The September issue of Wired Magazine features an article called "MIT Everyware" about <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">the OpenCourseWare project</a>, which aims to offer material from every course at MIT, all under a Creative Commons license. As the article suggests, various educational organizations around the world have sprung up to help translate and disseminate the materials. <a href="http://www.fetp.edu.vn/legalnoticesV.html">Here's a translation</a> of the Creative Commons license used in <a href="http://www.fetp.edu.vn/fetpocwV.htm">Vietnam's OpenCourseWare material</a>, for students such as the one described in Ho Chi Minh City. Creative Commons co-founder and board member <a href="http://creativecommons.org/learn/aboutus/people#1">Hal Abelson</a> is also quoted in the article.</p>
