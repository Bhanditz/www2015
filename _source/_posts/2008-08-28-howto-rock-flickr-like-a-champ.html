<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_to_rock_flickr_like_a_cham.php">Marshall Kirkpatrick at ReadWriteWeb lays it out:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Turn on Creative Commons Licensing</p>
<p>It's easy to turn the default setting for new photos uploaded to Creative Commons Attribution (our favorite) by visiting the <a href="http://flickr.com/account/?tab=privacy">Privacy &amp; Permissions tab in your account</a>.  Unfortunately there's not clear, working links from Flickr to an explanation of the different licenses.  Here they are <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses">on the Creative Commons site</a>.</p>
<p>CC Attribution is a license that says other people can use it and change it, including in a commercial context, as long as they give you attribution as the creator. It greases the wheels for quick and easy media sharing. That's good and it would be nice if more quality media was licensed this way. <strong>We keep a link to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/by-2.0/">Creative Commons by Attribution search on Flickr</a> in our browser toolbar and use it frequently for photos in posts.  Those could be your photos we and others are using!</strong></p></blockquote>
