<p>The Open Knowledge Festival team is thrilled to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/beabusaniche">Beatriz Busaniche</a> will be joining us as a keynote speaker in Berlin this year. Beatriz Busaniche is a free software and culture expert and advocate, a board member of the <a href="http://www.vialibre.org.ar/">VÃ­a Libre Foundation</a> in Argentina, a professor at the University of Buenos Aires, a core team member at <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.ar/">Creative Commons Argentina</a>, and a founding member of <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org.ar/">Wikimedia Argentina</a>.</p>
<p>Beatriz Busaniche's "Freedom has Never Been Cheap - A Call to Action for Freedom and the Public Domain" will draw on the wealth of experience she has in fighting to keep the internet open and free. This talk will do more than simply explain how the public domain is at risk; Beatriz will call on all OKFestival participants to lead the way for the entire global open knowledge community.</p>
<p>Because 'free' as in 'freedom' has never come cheap, she will ask that we go beyond passive learning by joining forces and putting ourselves on the front line in the fight for a free public domain. To help us take those first steps, Beatriz will offer examples of and learnings from her own experiences as an activist fighting for the freedom of the public domain and, in doing so, her keynote will aim to truly address and impact the challenges which we are currently facing in the intellectual property debate.</p>
<p>Here is a sneak peak (in Spanish) of Beatriz speaking at TEDxCordoba, and as you may be able to see, we have a lot to look forward to!</p>

We will open up the discussion to questions from the audience as we begin to develop long term strategies for engaging the entire open knowledge movement in the defence of the public domain!</p>
