<p>Earlier this spring, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4236">Creative Commons staff went down to Brazil to oversee the launch</a> of one of the first country-specific licenses. There was a big event attended by Gilberto Gil, the Minister of Culture for Brazil, and a film crew followed everyone around for a couple days. <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=opensource_movies&collectionid=CreativeCommonsCreativeCommonsBrasil">The result is a nice little 11 minute film</a> on the process of the licenses, the impact it could have on their culture, and reactions from the launch event. Watch it at the Internet Archive, and if you have your own videos like this to share, be sure to try out <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4507">our CC Publisher app</a> to add your films to the Archive as well.</p>
