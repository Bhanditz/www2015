<p>Congratulations to the Free Software Foundation on the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/gplv3_launched">release of the GNU General Public License, Version 3</a>. The GPL is critical underpinning for free software, but it is hard to overstate its importance for all computing, or indeed society at large.</p>
<p>The FSF took this responsibility extremely seriously, putting GPLv3 through by far the most rigorous versioning process of any public license to date. Creative Commons has <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7249">some experience</a> in this respect, but we are mere newbies by comparison.</p>
<p>Note that Creative Commons has always <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software.3F">recommended</a> the GPL and other free software licenses for software. We look forward to transitioning software we create to GPLv3.</p>
