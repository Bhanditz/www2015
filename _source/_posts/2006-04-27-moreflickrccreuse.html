<p>Last November Steve Jurveston <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5707">documented</a> use of one of his photos on the Charlie Rose Show in accordance with the CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Attribution</a> license used for the photo. Now Jurveston <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/136160787/">writes that some of his photos on Flickr have been used in a travel guide</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I<br />
started posting photos on flickr, I never thought theyâ€™d be anything<br />
but curiositiesâ€¦. geek stuff and macro shots of bugs. </p>
<p>I was happily surprised to see that 6 of my photos will be in a new <a href="http://www.schmap.com/photos/p=44124348109N01/c=SC20911306"> Hawaii Travel Guide</a> by Schmap.  They use CC licensed photos from flickr to enhance their maps.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cool...</p>
