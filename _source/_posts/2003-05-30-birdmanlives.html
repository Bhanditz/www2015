<p>Salon has a fun <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2003/05/29/harvey_birdman/index.html">piece</a>, "Pillaging the Cartoon Universe," about the Cartoon Network's "Birdman: Attorney at Law," a show saturated with cameos by characters from classic cartoons and other pop culture artifacts. Two disappointing aspects to this piece: 1) the bulk of it is available only to Salon "premium" subscribers, and 2) author Scott Thill makes no mention of how the Birdman creators go about clearing rights for the re-use of copyrighted characters (ironic, given that the show centers around Birdman's life as a litigator).</p>
<p>Anyone out there know the answer? Do the Birdman people enjoy a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3613">Mike Meyers-like</a> licensing deal, are they asserting fair use, or is it a combination of the two?</p>
