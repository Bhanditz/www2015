<p>Last year, we were thrilled to have Shepard Fairey craft a beautiful new design for our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18166">campaign T-shirt</a>. Knowing they'd be a hot commodity, we kept a limited number of the shirts and are now making them available in our online store until they sell out. If you didn't grab one of these beauties last fall, now is your chance! </p>
<p>The t-shirts are available for $25, a very affordable way to show your support for Creative Commons and look good doing it! Men's sizes (S-XXL) available in black and women's sizes (S-M) available in gray. Hurry over to the <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/node/65">CC store</a> and get yours today.</p>
