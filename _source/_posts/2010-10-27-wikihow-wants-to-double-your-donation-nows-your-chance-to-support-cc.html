<p><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">wikiHow</a>, the world's largest and highest quality how-to manual wants to double your donation to Creative Commons! Starting right now, wikiHow is matching every dollar of the next $4000 given to CC. That means if you donate $10, $25, $75 to CC right now, your impact will be automatically doubled thanks to wikiHow. Hurry, you only have a limited time to meet their challenge! </p>

<p>Why is wikiHow challenging you to give to CC this year? Here's what Jack Herrick, wikiHow's Founder, has to say:</p>
<p><em><img class="alignright" src="img/jackherrick.jpg" />wikiHow is all about enabling people to share and learn: Our contributors share their knowledge with us and then we bring their expertise to the largest possible audience. This works so well because of Creative Commons. Supporting this organization ensures that the tools to share and build upon knowledge will be maintained as the electronic age continues to evolve.</em></p>
<p>wikiHow feels so strongly about the importance of CC and a sharing culture that they're not just donating their cash but are also sharing with the world instructions on how to support <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Donate-to-Creative-Commons">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Support-the-Free-Culture-Movement">Free Culture</a>, and how to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Look-for-Freely-Licensed-Images-on-Google">find CC licensed images</a>.</p>
<p>Join wikiHow in supporting CC, and have your donation automatically doubled. If you've haven't yet given to our fundraising campaign, now is your chance. It's easy, you're just <a href="http://www.creativecommons.net/donate">a few clicks away</a> from showing the world how much sharing means to you.</p>
