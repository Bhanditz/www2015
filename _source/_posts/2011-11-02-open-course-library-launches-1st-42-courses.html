<p>On Monday, the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) released the first <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/creativecommons.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlQEyzXyEJfRdGdhOExOTktyNFRxZ2dpVFM4cE11T3c&hl=en_US#gid=0">42</a> of the state's high-enrollment 81 <a href="http://www.opencourselibrary.org/">Open Course Library</a> courses. The remaining <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/creativecommons.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlQEyzXyEJfRdHZPUTcyRE1NeU1FWFpSeUtmekQ4YkE&hl=en_US#gid=0">39</a> courses will be finished by 2013. Funded by the Washington State Legislature and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Open Course Library joins the global open educational resources (OER) movement, and adheres to SBCTCâ€™s <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22712">open policy</a>, which requires that all materials created through system grants be openly licensed for the public to freely use, adapt and distribute.</p>
<p>All courses are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 unported license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY</a>).</p>
<p>The first 42 courses are available in <a href="http://www.opencourselibrary.org/phase-1-courses">multiple technical formats</a> including:</p>

<p>Michael Kenyon's students at Green River Community College used to pay nearly $200 for a new pre-calculus textbook. Now they pay only $20 for a book â€“ or use it online for free. Kenyon's <a href="http://www.opentextbookstore.com/precalc/">pre-calculus textbook</a> (CC BY SA) was written by community college faculty David Lippman and Melonie Rasmussen, who teach at Pierce College Fort Steilacoom. "We looked at a lot of textbooks," Kenyon said. "There are some people who think this is the best book out there."</p>
<p>â€œThe courses were created with the needs of Washingtonâ€™s college students in mind,â€ said Tom Caswell, SBCTC Open Education Policy Associate. â€œAnd with the idea we would share the courses with the world.â€</p>
<p>Each course was developed and peer reviewed by a team of instructors, instructional designers and librarians. Use of the course materials is optional, but many faculty and departments are already moving to adopt them.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="http://t.co/ZXcif11g">informal study</a> by the Student Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs), the Open Course Library could save students as much as $41.6 million on textbooks annually if adopted at all of Washingtonâ€™s community and technical colleges. The study also estimates that the 42 faculty course developers will save students $1.26 million by using the materials during the 2011-2012 school year, which alone exceeds the $1.18 million cost of creating the 42 courses. â€œThese savings will not only help Washingtonâ€™s students afford college, but clearly provide a tremendous return on the original investment,â€ said Nicole Allen, Textbook Advocate for the Student PIRGs.</p>
<p>Justin Hamilton, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, said the Washington state effort was groundbreaking for the nation. "Lowering college costs increases a student's ability to take more courses, finish their degree on time, and enter the workforce prepared for success in a global economy. That's not just good for them, it's good for the country.â€</p>
<p>"It really is the beginning of the end of closed, expensive, proprietary commercial textbooks that are completely disconnected from today's reality," said <a href="http://reuvencarlyle36.com/">Rep. Reuven Carlyle</a> (D-Seattle) of Washington Stateâ€™s 36th District, a <a href="http://learningbeyondtextbooks.org/advocacy/reuven-carlyle-talk-on-oer-and-policy/">champion</a> of the Open Course Library and OER. â€œThis is a significant state investment in this era of massive budget cuts. We had little choice but to seize the opportunity of this crisis to challenge the status quo of the old-style cost models in both K-12 and higher education.â€</p>
