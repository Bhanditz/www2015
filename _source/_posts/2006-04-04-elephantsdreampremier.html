<p>Bjorn Wijers of CC Netherlands sends this about the successful premier of <em>Elephants Dream</em> (previous post -- <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5772">Your textures in a movie</a>):</p>
<p>The Blender movie 'Elephants Dream' (previously known under the working<br />
title Orange) was released last friday with a crowded but nice <a href="http://orange.blender.org/blog/premiere-after-party-sold-out">premiere</a><br />
at the Ketelhuis in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Elephants Dream is the<br />
world's first film which was completely created using Open Source<br />
Software and released under the Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Attribution</a> license. The film was<br />
realised by the Blender Foundation, known by the excellent 3D open<br />
source program Blender, and The Netherlands Media Art Institute,<br />
Montevideo/Time Based Arts.</p>
<p>Summary from Motevideo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elephants Dream is a story with quick-witted dialogue, tightly designed<br />
architecture and unusual sound effects. The main characters, Emo (a cool<br />
young trumpeter) and Proog (a confused â€“ or maybe not? â€“ loner) are each<br />
stuck in a world of their own. At a certain moment they cross paths with<br />
one another. The oddball Proog cautiously tries to introduce his young<br />
friend Emo to his world. When Emo realizes that Proog primarily wants to<br />
push his ideas on him, this leads to a conflict between them. But can<br />
Emo survive in Proogâ€™s world? And can they overcome their conflicts, or<br />
will they each go their own way in life?<br />
Tygo Gernandt and Cas Jansen create two unique personalities that<br />
command the imagination, and carry the viewer along into a bizarre world<br />
that consists of a bleak wasteland with a tangle of cables and other<br />
alien landscapes, a living typewriter, an enormous elevator shaft, and<br />
especially a lot of very strange birds.</p></blockquote>
