<li><b>CC Fundraising Campaign</b><br />
Also, this CC Salon marks the beginning of Creative Commons' annual fundraising campaign, so don't hesitate to bring your checkbook (or PayPal login info -- we'll have laptops on hand) to show your support for the work we do. This is your chance to donate a few bucks and be the first person on your block to get the brand new CC t-shirt design (which is super awesome). Donating to CC helps support the development of tools that help enable a participatory culture.
