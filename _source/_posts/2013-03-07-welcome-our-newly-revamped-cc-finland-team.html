<p>CC invites you to help us welcome some new additions to our CC Affiliate network - a team from the University of Aalto in Helsinki, Finland. </p>
<p>CC has long had a CC Finland team, headed up by Herkko Hietanen, a long-term contributor to Creative Commons: through his research and legal work, as well as leading the Creative Commons team in Finland. For many years Herkko and his team have been instrumental in the work to ensure our licenses are understood and applied in Finland.</p>
<p>However, in recent year Herkko's research project.............. has taken more of his time, giving him less time to work on CC in Finland.</p>
<p>Enter our new CC Finland team. Late last year, Sanna Marttila, Tarmo Toikkanen and Maria Rehbinder of the University of Aalto stepped up to take the lead of our Finnish team of Creative Commons. This new Finnish team has had a long running relationship with the world of open.  Sanna was part of the initial team working on the Finnish CC licences in ......., and they all assisted with the organisation of the Open Knowledge Foundation Festival at their university last year.</p>
<p>The new Finnish team has already secured funding to localize our CC0 tool and the upcoming CC 4.0 licenses and will complete these during 2013. This is especially important in Finland, since the all governmental institutions in Finland are mandated to publish they databases as open data. Currently the license used in a custom license in the spirit of CC BY, but most decision makers are planning to migrate to CC BY 4.0 once it is completed and localized.</p>
<p>The team will also continue their existing efforts in public outreach, with special focus on the educational and the cultural sectors. Museums in Finland are considering CC0 as their metadata license, but are waiting for the translated version of CC0 before they can really proceed on this.</p>
<p>We're extremely grateful to Herkko for his work over the years, and for his continued interest and engagement in Creative Commons, and happy to welcome this new team from the University of Aalto.</p>
