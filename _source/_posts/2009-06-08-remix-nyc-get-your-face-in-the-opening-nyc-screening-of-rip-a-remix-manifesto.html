<p>June is turning into quite the month for the NYC CC-community with both a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14904">CC Salon</a> and the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14418">Open Video Conference</a> taking place. For added enjoyment, <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/">Open Source Cinema</a> just announced <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/remixnyc">Remix NYC</a>, a digital celebration to commemorate the theatrical opening of <em><a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/project/rip2.0">Rip! A Remix Manifesto</a></em> at the Cinema Village in New York on June 19th. </p>
<p>The premise is simple - edit yourself in place of the advertisements that are abound in Javier Gutierrez's <em>Times Square</em> (pictured above) and upload it back to OSC's site for inclusion in the film. The final product will be an animated version of image where the billboards are slowly replaced by free culture activists. </p>
<p>Unbelievably cool but you have a short time to get your photos in as <strong>the deadline is June 14th</strong> - visit <a href="http://www.opensourcecinema.org/remixnyc">Remix NYC</a> for all the details.</p>
