<p>Neal Conan, of NPR's Talk of the Nation, is interviewing WIRED<br />
editor-in-chief Chris Anderson and Le Tigre's Kathleen Hanna at this<br />
very moment. Tune in to NPR to catch it (88.5 in the Bay Area); you can<br />
even call into the show and sound off.</p>
<p>One caller just now, from Waco, Texas: "I have remixed the Beastie<br />
Boys before, but never exactly legally. . . . To me this is very<br />
exciting, and I want to let them know that it's a great first step."</p>
<p>UPDATE: Show's over. But knowing NPR's programming habits, it'll come back on again today. It also looks like the show will be <a href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=5&amp;prgDate=current">online sometime soon</a>.</p>
