<p><a href="http://curvemusic.net">(&copy;urve)music&trade;</a>* is a very cool UK label which specializes in chilly Latin jazz and collects brilliant vocalists like nobody's business. They have agreed to throw several a cappellas and instrumental tracks into the Commons looking to gather enough material for a pair of all CC music remix albums later this year.</p>
<p><a href="http://ccmixter.org">ccMixter</a> is only happy to oblige by hosting the source material as of this morning under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0">Attribution Non-Commercial</a> license. We'll be running the call for remixes as the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/curve">(&copy;urve)music&trade; Remix Contest</a>. Check out the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/curve">contest home page</a> for the details.</p>
<p>*Don't get nervous, the 'tm' is for Talent Management.</p>
