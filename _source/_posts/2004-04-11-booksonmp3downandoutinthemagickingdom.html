<p>I watch the Internet Archive's <a href="http://www.archive.org/audio/">Open Source Audio</a> area for material that could be used for legal remixes including spoken word audio. </p>
<p>In wonderful news, this morning's postings include Andrew Levine's <a href="http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=opensource_audio&collectionid=DOMKCH1_128kbmp3">audio reading</a> of the first chapter to <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow's</a> <a href="http://craphound.com/down/">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a>. The book had been available online under a somewhat restrictive CC in text format for a while but Cory <a href="http://craphound.com/ebooksneitherenorbooks.txt">recently loosened the reins</a> and the artistic community <a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/archives/2004_04.php#000123">seems to be responding</a>.</p>
