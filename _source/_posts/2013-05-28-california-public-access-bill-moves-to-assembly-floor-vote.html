<p>After passing through the Assembly Appropriations Committee last week (with bipartisan support), California's <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB609">Taxpayer Access to Publicly Funded Research Act (AB 609)</a> will now reach the Assembly floor for a vote this week. If the proposed bill passes the Assembly, it will move to the California State Senate. </p>
<p>To recap, AB 609 would require that the final peer-reviewed manuscript of research funded through California tax dollars be made publicly available within 12 months of publication. If passed, AB 609 would be the first state-level bill requiring free public access to publicly funded research. </p>
<p>The Association of American Publishes attempted to scuttle the bill by <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AAP_Opposition_AB609.pdf">sending a letter</a> filled with inaccurate, misleading information. However, public access advocates <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Eisen_AB609_AAP_Response.pdf">made their voices heard</a> to appropriations committee members, <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/state/legislation/php-app/read_doc.php?id=2245">again correcting the FUD</a> spread by entrenched publishing interests. </p>
<p>If you're a California resident, <a href="https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=9220">you can contact your Assembly member now</a> to ask that they support AB 609.</p>
