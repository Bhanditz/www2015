<p>No, not another contest -- see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3820">Can you remix?</a> (results soon) and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/3765">GET CREATIVE!</a> (you still have time) -- but artists can't have all the fun.</p>
<p>If you can code, we want you to check out our<br />
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/technology/challenges">technology challenges</a> section.  GUI developer to Semantic Web pioneer, we have a task for you -- help build Creative Commons' vision of some rights reserved into today's software and the infrastructure of the Net.</p>
<p>No prizes available apart from intellectual stimulation and bragging rights.</p>
