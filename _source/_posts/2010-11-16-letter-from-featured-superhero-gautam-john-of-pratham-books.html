<p>I'm pleased to introduce Gautam John, one of our exceptional CC Superheroes, who will tell you in his own words why he supports Creative Commons and why <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">you should too</a>. Gautam John is Manager of New Projects at Pratham Books, a children's book publisher in India that truly embodies a spirit of openness and innovation on the web. They've now released <a href="http://www.scribd.com/document_collections/2300329?page=1">105 children's books</a> (in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi and Gujarati) as well as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/prathambooks/collections/72157619814442224/">loads of delightful illustrations</a> under a CC-BY license so they can easily be shared and even remixed to create <a href="http://www.scribd.com/document_collections/2647987">new content</a> relevant to other languages and cultures. Here is Pratham's story. Join Gautam in <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">supporting Creative Commons with a donation today.</a></p>

<p><strong class="lede">"As a children's book publisher, we have always struggled to be as inclusive as we can. However, as a small non-profit, we do function under severe constraints of time, money and&nbsp;ability to live up to this ideal and it was the Creative Commons model of licensing that allowed us one of our biggest moments of joy</strong> &mdash; when our books were made available as Braille and Audio Books for print impaired children across the world. Without the Creative Commons licensing model and philosophy, we would not have been able to engage with multiple organizations to help build inclusion and scale.</p>
<p>At Pratham Books, we have a very simple mission - â€œA Book in Every Child's Handâ€ and this drives all of our work and we constantly test what we do against this goal. The mission has two parts, one is to create more reading matter such that there is more available for children to read and the second really is a corollary â€“ that we need to be able to get books to where children need it the most and that the books need to be culturally and linguistically relevant as well.</p>
<p>This is where our challenge lies â€“ to massively scale the production of high quality, low-cost children's books for a massively multi-lingual and multi-cultural market. Looking at this challenge it is fairly obvious that this is not a problem that any one organization can solve. The solution has to be scalable, flexible and catalyse our fundamental mission as well.</p>
<p>At this point, we realised that there were several internal questions to answer and some of them painfully introspective. Questions as to whether the books we create and distribute have to be a Pratham Book, whether it implied that every book must be paid for by either the reader or an intermediary and, from being a publisher, questions as to whether we are gatekeepers of content or content curators, how we could create infinite good with finite time and resources and most importantly, how we can create more value than we capture?</p>

<p>Having answered most of these questions using â€œopennessâ€ (whereby, we asked ourselves whether allowing unrestricted access to use and re-use our content furthered our mission) as a test and finding that it did fit our mission, the second set of questions to answer was more technical â€“ how, as a small non-profit, do we do this and not find ourselves overwhelmed. It was at this point that we had a moment of realization â€“ that reading is an extremely social activity and that there are communities and organizations who were more than ready to help us achieve our goals.</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that we hit upon the Creative Commons licensing model as one that would help us achieve many of our aims of flexibility, scalability and being able to help catalyse our mission of a book in every child's hands. In particular, three things stood out â€“ a shared value system of sharing and openness, a community that was deeply embedded in these ideals and, from our perspective, it was scalable because it allowed us to license content to multiple organizations and individuals, both known and unknown, with a one time effort of releasing them under a Creative Commons license as opposed to the traditional model which involves time consuming negotiations and discussions with each known organization or individual who wants to use our content.</p>
<p>As an organization, we did spend some time choosing a license and, from our perspective, a choice between openness and sharing which reduced to a choice between the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Attribution</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Attribution-Share-Alike</a> license. We have decided that the Attribution license will be our default license with a fall-back to the Attribution-Share-Alike license in cases where needed. It is best said by <a href="https://docs.google.com/View?id=dc394dmc_179hdvhk33c">P2PU</a> â€œit emerged that our choice lay between two licences: Creative Commons Attribution and Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike ...chose to use Creative Commons licences because Creative Commons have become a global standard and are supported by a large international community. Both licences are Free Culture licences and are more permissive than any of the other Creative Commons licences. In other words, the choice was not between two extremes but between two open licences at the same end of the licence spectrum.â€ Given that our goal was being as open as possible, it followed that our license choices were essentially around licenses that allowed for the greatest possible use and re-use because our initial hypothesis was, and continues to be, that being open allows us to fulfill our mission better than a traditional copyright model allows.</p>
<p>We now use Creative Commons licenses everywhere! We license entire books under CC-BY and CC-BY-SA licenses, we license our illustrations similarly and even photographs and other publicity material too. Over the last year we have been building the foundations for a social publishing model â€“ where we curate communities that are passionate about reading and help us create content. Such a model rests on the idea of a participatory culture and an essential ingredient is a permissive licensing strategy â€“ Creative Commons licenses offers us this, a large community with shared values and an ecosystem to tap in to.</p>
<p>While this licensing and publishing model works well in theory, it has been extremely heartening for us to see it come to life â€“ our communities have created multiple derivative works ranging from <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/2010/05/our-first-ipad-applications.html">iPad and iPhone applications</a>, to porting our works to <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/2009/07/pratham-books-reaches-nepal-through.html">OLPC laptops</a>, to <a href="http://blog.prathambooks.org/2010/05/announcing-results-of-retell-remix.html">creating entirely new books</a> from existing illustrations and, my personal favourite, creating versions of our books for the print impaired â€“ from <a href="http://www.bookshare.org/quickSearch?keyword=pratham+books">DAISY and Braille</a> books to <a href="http://www.inclusiveplanet.com/en/group/509815">rich audio books</a> such that our mission truly does encompass every single child.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we would not have been able to achieve what success we have had without the help of Creative Commons licensing. These licenses and the values that they stand for are vital to building and strengthening a digital commons from which we all benefit. I hope you will consider <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate">supporting Creative Commons</a> and licensing content that you own or control such that we all benefit from the growth of the commons."</p>
