<p>Yesterday, I attended the <a href="http://cn.creativecommons.org/en/">Creative Commons China</a> Photo Content ceremony at the National Library in Beijing. There were 10,000 submissions of professional and amateur works licensed under various CC licenses. There were three categories: Society, Nature and Portraits. Winners were chosen by a panel of judges including famous photographers, professors and other notable people. The photographs were amazing. There is <a href="http://cc.nphoto.net/contest2007/winners.html">a web page of the winning photographs</a>. Donâ€™t forget to click the link underneath the winning photos for the second place winner gallery.</p>
<p>While we have silly people in the West saying that for every free photo on Flickr a professional photographer loses their job, we have professional photographers in China licensing their best works under CC licenses. As far as I could tell, the amateur and professional photographers seemed integrated and supportive of each other.</p>
<p>After the awards ceremony, we have a workshop with presentations from an illustrious and interesting group of speakers. Overall a groundbreaking and well executed event. Congratulations Chunyan and the CC China team!</p>
