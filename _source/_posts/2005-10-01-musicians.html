<p><a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/">Scott Andrew LePera</a>   founded the lo-fi folk-rock project the Walkingbirds in 1998, around   the same time he discovered the Web. Since then he's actively recorded   and released songs in MP3 format directly onto the Web from his little   bedroom studio in Northern California. The Walkingbirds' <a href="http://www.walkingbirds.com">website</a> sees several hundred   downloads each month from all over the world, and their first CD release,    <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/walkingbirds">The Sandalwood   Sessions</a>, is available exclusively on the Web.</p>
<p><a href="http://dealerkids.com/">Dealership</a> began, in a sense,   as a music project conceived by <a href="http://dealerkids.com/chrisw.asp">Chris Wetherell</a> in 1995 while studying at U.C. Berkeley. To augment his classical   studies, he began to think of ways he could explore pop music on his   own. When he met <a href="http://dealerkids.com/chrisg.asp">Chris   Groves</a>, also a student and musician, an idea took root: Chris W.   thought it would be cool to start a band with Chris G. His newfound   whimsy impelled him to visit Guitar Center one afternoon and blow his   student loan check on band gear. Then came a few months of drum 'n' bass work, which didn't go   anywhere except to convince the Chrises that they needed at least one   guitarist. They begged everyone they knew to be in the band with them,   until finally, sucker that she was, <a href="http://dealerkids.com/jane.asp">Jane</a> agreed to learn to play   the guitar.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1998 they released their first EP, <a href="http://dealerkids.com/ cds.asp?title=secret+american+livingroom">Secret American   Livingroom</a>, which they recorded in Menlo Park with Guy Higbey. It   was sheer luck that they found a great recording engineer who was   patient, willing to teach, and open to playing around with some of the   pop trio's more outlandish ideas. Loaded with pop hooks and pretty   vocals, it became favorite of local college DJs and indie scenesters.   On the strength of this debut, they played <a href="http://noisepop.com/">Noisepop</a> 1999 with Imperial   Teen, and later that year, <a href="http://www.cmj.com/">CMJ</a> in New York.</p>
<p>Their next album, <a href="http://dealerkids.com/cds.asp?id=2">TV   Highway to the Stars</a>, was released in late 2001, and they've spent   much of 2002 working on a follow-up.</p>
<p>These unsigned musicians have embraced the Internet, thorns and all. We caught up with them to talk about their thoughts on how tough it is to make it in music today, what they love about using the Internet to get their music out, what worries them, and how they plan to use Creative Commons licences for their work.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Commons: In the current world of music, unsigned   bands greatly outnumber signed recording artists. Tell us a   bit about your bands, how you got started, and what types of music you   create. How long have you been making music?</strong></p>
<p><em>Scott, Walkingbirds</em>: I've been writing and recording music   for over a decade, ever since I got my hands on a roommate's 4-track   back in college. I started playing in bands while at school, although   the music I played was much different, mostly grungesque and prog-rock   stuff. After my main band broke up, I tinkered with the idea of a   stripped-down acoustic act, with lots of vocal harmony and interplay --   very different from what I had been doing before.</p>
<p>The Walkingbirds were formed in 1997, and by that time I had a small   catalog of new songs [and was] looking for a voice. From the start we decided   this was going to be more of a "project" than a band. A "band" implies   that we actually rehearse and perform regularly; we wanted to keep it   very casual, so we could skip out on a rehearsal and go drink beer with   a clear conscience. My co-writer Laurie Hallal had recently gone   through the breakup of her very popular band, and we were both burnt   out from the effort of trying to make a band work. The goal was to   write songs and put them to tape, and have fun doing it. No more than   that.</p>
<p>I moved to California in the summer of 2000, and the Walkingbirds as   a duo ended. It was around this time that I realized that most of what   we paid to have done in a studio could be done inexpensively on a PC.   After a bit of tinkering I managed to record and release a handful of   new tunes under the Walkingbirds name, exporting them straight to MP3   format and <a href="http://www.walkingbirds.com/main/mp3">uploading them to my website</a>. So now the Walkingbirds are   fully a one-person DIY record-at-home musical project in the strictest   sense.</p>
<p><em>Jane, Dealership</em>: Oh, I like the idea of a "project" as   opposed to a "band" very much. In a way that frees you from having to   stick to genres. The toughest and most annoying question bookers and   promotional people ask is, "Who do you sound like?" When you're in a   band, you feel you have to develop a "band" sound -- not that we really   do that in Dealership. Which is why it's hard to say what we sound   like.</p>
<p><strong>CC: How much work and time goes into writing a new song or   cutting a complete CD?</strong></p>
<p><em>Scott, Walkingbirds</em>: It's always an uphill battle for me,   mostly because the ideas don't come easy. I'm lucky if I can complete   one song in six months. It was a bit easier when I had bandmates,   because you have more contributors and feedback and can complete a song   faster, but the end result is usually much different than when you're   writing solo. I have bits and pieces of songs lying around from years   ago -- a chorus here, a bridge here -- waiting to be completed.   Sometimes these bits never become whole songs, and sometimes I'll be   noodling around with some old chord progression and things will   suddenly click.</p>
<p>Because I record at home, I have the luxury of taking my time and   having complete control. Sometimes I'll work on a sampled drum track   for weeks to ensure it sounds as natural and "live" as possible. Or   sometimes I'll stay up late applying random effects to the bass track,   just to hear what happens. If I'm unhappy with a vocal take two weeks   after I recorded it, I don't have to book another few hours at the   studio four weeks from now; I can walk go into the bedroom, erase it,   and do another. There's no clock, no engineer running patch cords, no   arguing with the lead singer, no hauling a drum kit into the   basement.</p>
<p>That said, I can't really say that technology has improved my   songwriting. It's made me more productive by taking away barriers, like   the expense of a studio or CD duplication. Occassionally I'll hear   something while tinkering with <a href="http://www.fruityloops.com/">FruityLoops</a> or <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/">Reason</a> that will give me   an idea, a place to start. But inevitably it comes down to what   (Smithereens' guitarist) Pat DiNizio calls "ass in chair" -- I have to   turn off the machine, pick up the guitar, sit down and just write the   damn song. I usually have to have a tune completely written in my head   before I open ProTools. The great thing about all of this is that, when   I <em>am</em> ready to record, I can do it immediately without the   constraints I used to have a few years ago.</p>
<p><em>Jane, Dealership</em>: I would love to do what you do, Scott.   Since we put out our first album, we've been throwing around the idea   of what Chris W. would call, in his Marxist way, "owning the means of   production." But assembling the components necessary to record a   four-piece band with three vocals daunted us, and it's not until   recently that Chris W., who has always been a tireless promoter for his   integrative capitalist ideals, has really initiated the purchase of   computers and tools to record our own stuff at home. We are also   starting to play more with non-live sounds -- drum machines, samples,   electronically derived sounds -- and that makes it easier to make music   without expensive, fancy mics.</p>
<p>I think that would definitely change our songwriting style, too. The   way we do it now, we pretty much complete the song (or we try to)   before we go into the studio -- because we don't want to waste a lot of   time and money tinkering. Of course we end up tinkering somewhat. But   in the future I see the recording process as an integral part of   songwriting -- in my fantasy, as I mentioned, we email tracks to each   other and build off those. Maybe the danger will be we just won't know   when to stop! We'll create an infinite loop of music.</p>
<p><strong>CC: When you post an mp3 of your music somewhere online,   what are the advantages to doing it? What sorts of things are you   looking forward to when you offer your music this way?</strong></p>
<p><em>Scott, Walkingbirds</em>: Immediate distribution: I don't have to take the extra step of pressing   a CD and shipping it out. I often just rip the audio mixdown directly   to MP3 and post it the same night I complete the mix.</p>
<p>Immediate feedback: I love hearing from someone who really liked the   song, and appreciate the comments from people who thought the drums   were too loud, the bassline too cheesy, and so on. And every so often I   get a message from someone in Pakistan or Senegal, or somewhere distant   that I will probably never see in my lifetime, and I am totally blown   away.</p>
<p><em>Chris W., Dealership</em>: Often, when thinking about the value of distributing our songs as MP3s,   I'm reminded of a lyric from the song of a band we know well (<a href="http://imperialteen.com/">Imperial   Teen</a>, Luxury). The lyric reads: "I'm looking for a family who listens   to my songs." MP3 sharing has powerfully enabled our ability to join   communities of shared values and aesthetics and support. I've watched   our behavior as artists change; we now derive a good deal of   inspiration from the community of people who've listened to us and   responded and shared their songs or their weblogs or their art. Artists   who don't share MP3s probably have a difficult time leveling the   communication between fan and artist to a more rewarding interchange.   If a band doesn't participate in a sharing community, what kind of fan   would be inspired to do more than email them and say, "Hey, liked your   band on Thursday," or "I loved that song"? We can trade music and ideas   with a subset of people who already are thinking a lot about music, are   exposed to many things (via <a href="http://openp2p.com/">P2P</a>), and can take an active role in   developing a critical aesthetic. The Internet, being a data exchange,   is a lot more suited to that than any other medium.</p>
<p>MP3 distribution is also pretty nifty since it often enlists other   people as third-party distributors via peer-to-peer processes. It's a   much quicker path to community building. (But not the quickest path to   passive distribution of knowledge about your music, a process otherwise   known as getting your name out there. That distinction, to be sure,   still belongs to television.)</p>
<p>We also realize that there may be people who are encouraged to buy   one of our CDs after listening to an MP3. But this result, while   positive, is really, really low on the list of other values returned   from sharing MP3s.</p>
<p>Free trading of our music has genuine, verifiable returns.   Community. Exchanges of artistic thought and aesthetic commodity. . .   The RIAA argument that artists won't particpate in the marketplace of   ideas without financial compensation for CDs seems pretty short-sighted   from where we sit.</p>
<p><strong>CC: Conversely, can you think of any disadvantages of doing   it? What things do you worry about when offering your music files   online?</strong></p>
<p><em>Jane, Dealership</em>: There are disadvantages. Recording, for us, costs money; we spent some   time and money designing and producing the CD sleeves, too. And then   the cost of pressing the CDs -- it adds up fast. It would be great if   everyone who downloaded Dealership would also go out and buy a CD. It's   a little depressing that they don't, I guess. But if we ever make it to   Boise, there's a chance that some kids will have heard of us and will   want to see us play and maybe buy some t-shirts and related   merchandise. Also a lot of the indie scenesters are sensitive to the   poverty of the musicians they like and are quite cool about insisting   on paying for CDs.</p>
<p>I think ultimately the lesson that music makers, including the major   labels, need to learn is that music will be free -- utterly, completely,   totally. What we'll get paid for are related products -- like the   t-shirts, or the live shows, or the unique CD insert, or the poster, or   -- well, maybe we're not smart enough to have thought of all that can   happen. We need to change our revenue models. Fortunately it's easy for   us -- easier than if we were a major label. We're small, we're   flexible, and we don't practice economies of scale. We can print 1000   CDs and watch how they sell, and shift if we need to. Which actually   puts us in a better position to respond to emergent technologies, and   to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Besides, it's not like we're in this for the money, anyway.</p>
<p><em>Scott, Walkingbirds</em>: Obviously I don't get any money for offering free downloads. But at   this level you really can't do it for the money. You've got to take   that opportunity to connect with the people who are going to become   your fans and turn them into repeat customers who'll come see you play   and buy your t-shirts.</p>
<p>One thing that does cross my mind from time to time is the   possibility that some shmuck will take a song of mine and pass it off   as his own. Or, that some company will start using one of my tunes as a   jingle for snack crackers or something. But the Web has this tendency   to sniff these people out, and I figure it wouldn't be long before   someone emailed me with a note, "Hey, did you hear this? This sounds   like YOUR song." And that's where traditional, tried-and-true copyright   law can still be effective -- because even though I choose to make a   song freely available, there are still limits. Under a modified license   I might even be willing to allow someone to add my song to his setlist,   or use it in a soundtrack.</p>
<p>But the same rule applies: ask first, because otherwise you   <em>will</em> be found out, and your name plastered all over   <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">MetaFilter</a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>. Discovery is just a Google search away!</p>
<p><em>Chris W., Dealership</em>: The downside of this method is significant and obvious. We aren't   compensated monetarily.</p>
<p>Which would be a disaster <em>if</em> we couldn't derive   compensation through other means such as live performance and   merchandise. But we can. And because MP3s are traded for free with   excellent, easy-to-install tools for sharing and downloading, this   method generally yields the highest amount of people actually listening   to our songs. Which, if they enjoy the art we create, can be very   gratifying personally.</p>
<p>As far as worry. . . we can't imagine that there's too much to ever   worry about regarding fair use of music. People like songs. They'll   share music with friends and family. As they always have.</p>
<p>I know what you're getting at, though. Many people worry that   offering music files online means No Money For Daddy.</p>
<p>But, as I've said before, I am not entirely convinced that the   Internet-music-delivery industry and the   CD/Cassette/Vinyl-delivery-industry are commodifying the same product.   The reason I'm not yet convinced is that it seems unclear to me whether   the "norms" for consumption of music are moving dramatically away from   CDs and toward digital MP3 encoded files. Doesn't it seem more   realistic to state that a subset of music consumers are both buying CDs   (perhaps less than before) and downloading free MP3s? I believe that   the elements of CD packaging -- including cover, booklet, and CD design   -- as well as the product's very physicalness (something that allows   for unlimited portability and decorative collection), are such valuable   characteristics as to make a practical differentiation possible.</p>
<p>Which is to say that I don't think people will <em>ever</em>    stop buying music on physical media. And as a result, I believe that   musicians will always be compensated monetarily. Consumers may become   choosier about their purchases, though. Thanks to peer networks, there   are many cheap and efficient methods for previewing a particular   product's contents.</p>
<p><strong>CC: Now that you've seen the licenses available from the   Creative Commons site, can you tell us how you plan to use them for   your band's work? Considering the potential drawbacks to releasing   music online, can you see some benefits from using licenses with your   work?</strong></p>
<p><em>Scott, Walkingbirds</em>: I'm seriously considering a combination of Attribution, Non-commercial,   and Share Alike for my material. My primary concern is allowing the   public the widest possible access to my songs. I don't want people who   just like my music to have to jump through legal hoops to listen to it   on their computer or add a song to their <a href="http://www.live365.com/">Live365</a> webcast. I want people   to share and enjoy this music by whatever means they have. The   licensing options I've chosen should allow all of that, while   protecting the important parts: I get attribution, and you still have   to ask my permission to profit from my work. And if you want to   make a funked-out disco remix, you can do that, as long as the end   result is covered under the same license.</p>
<p>In some ways, it's no different than regular copyright, except with   the restrictions on copying and file-sharing relaxed. I'm comfortable   with that. No more of this "you can only make one copy for yourself"   crap. Artists have to get used to the idea that people WILL copy your   stuff, they WILL share it with friends, and yes, it's likely that you   WILL find your entire album on the Internet. The question is are you   gonna treat those people as fans, or thieves? Do you think people who   like your music will appreciate being called thieves? Is that any way   to establish a relationship with your new, online fanbase? Maybe the   big labels can handle it, but I know that at my level, I can't afford   to alienate a single potential fan.</p>
<p>I'm much more comfortable saying, "Here are some songs, go forth and   copy," and not worry about it. What little money I lose to copying,   I'll make up in mutual respect from happy fans, who, I hope, will come   to my shows and buy my t-shirts.</p>
<p><em>Chris W, Dealership</em>: I think we'll be releasing songs using the Noncommercial license. The upside is that people who are already sharing our songs and have every intention of continuing to do so will not be incorrectly identified as criminals. And we'll have some ammunition against unauthorized   compilations and unwanted inclusion in advertising. (Though, as a   suggestion to the good people involved in this endeavor, it would be   nice if this license could be applied specifically to a file format,   like mp3 compression, and not to, say, .WAV sound files.)</p>
<p>As for the other licenses, Share Alike and Attribution suggest a   release we've always talked about but never produced: a karaoke version   of a song or two of ours. Be your own Chris Groves or Jane Pinckard in   the comfort of your living room. Or cubicle, if you have a small mic,   recording software, and understanding co-workers.</p>
