<p>The good people of SF Beta are in the holiday spirit and because of that have changed their monthly mixer to a <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/130051/">charity event</a>. Donations gathered will be given to Creative Commons, <a title="the EFF" href="http://eff.org">the EFF</a>, and <a href="http://www.joshwolf.net/blog/?page_id=211">the Josh Wolf Legal Defense Fund</a>. CC's portion will go towards our 2006 fundraising campaign goal of $ 300,000. Our campaign ends at the end of December, so if  you're looking to show some CC support and mingle with others interested in similar issues come check out the SF Beta party!</p>
