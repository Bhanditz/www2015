<p>Today's San Jose Mercury News has a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/eyeheadlines/ci_5493686">wonderful article about Brazilian Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil</a> taking time off for a solo tour. As readers of this blog know, Gil has been a tremendous friend of and influence on Creative Commons. The last three paragraphs of the article concern this, ending with this quote:<br />
<blockquote> "I don't see Creative Commons as something I do because of the specific implications it would have on the Brazilian scene," says Gil, who has licensed several of his songs for Creative Commons use. "It's universal, but especially for developing countries, for Africa, Central and South America, I think this possibility of being able to share, to continue to be creative in this cooperative way, is very important."</p></blockquote>
<p>Gil also recently <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7272">spoke at SXSW and was covered in the NYT</a>.</p>
