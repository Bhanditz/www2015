<p><img src="img/indaba.jpg" alt="indaba" title="indaba" width="258" height="45" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;" /><a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/">Indaba Music</a> has had a busy summer. </p>
<p>July saw the launch of <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/indablog/5201-tour-the-new-indaba-music">Session Console 2.0</a>, an upgrade of Indaba's digital music workstation that allows musicians to collaboratively record, edit, and mix tracks online. An improved engine built on Sun Microsystemsâ€™ JavaFX platform makes the tool more robust and streamlined. The relaunch was paired with a new library of CC-licensed audio loops and sounds that Indaba solicited from its community.</p>
<p>Not only has Indaba worked to improve the ease and power of its tools, but the company has also been hard at work producing <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/featured_programs">compelling programs</a> for its community to engage in. The <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15594">previously mentioned</a> remix contest with twin sister pop-rock act Carmen and Camille saw audio stems from the duo's song â€œShine 4Uâ€ available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>. Similar remix contests from <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/featured_programs/show/riverscuomo">Rivers Cuomo</a> of Weezer and <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/featured_programs/show/tcm">The Crystal Method</a> gave community members the ability to win some <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/default.asp?ProductID=27&CollectionID=16">amazing</a><a href="http://korg.com/product.aspx?&pd=545"> musical gear</a>, while a collaboration with <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/featured_programs/show/intrahealth">Intrahealth OPEN</a> found artists submitting music in an effort to help fund health care services for the developing world.</p>
<p>This is all while maintaining and supporting an <a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/community">active community</a> of artists that are creating and collaborating on new music everyday. Check out our March 2008 <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8099">interview</a> conducted with Indaba co-founders Matthew Siegel and Daniel Zaccagnino for more information.</p>
