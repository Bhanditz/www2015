<p><a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/">Brad Sucks</a> is a staff favorite musician that posts all his music online and under CC licenses. <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/people/bradsucks">Brad's posted most of his tracks</a> to <a href="http://www.ccmixter.org/">Mixter</a> and got enough remixes in response that he recently collected them into <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/albums/i_dont_know_remixed/">a complete remix album</a> (based on <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/music/">his original songs</a>). Now he's part of a new <a href="http://www.myvirtualband.com/bradsucks_contest.php">Online Collaboration Contest</a> over at <a href="http://www.myvirtualband.com/">MyVirtualBand</a>. The terms for <a href="http://www.myvirtualband.com/terms.php#terms3">all contributions are CC licensed</a> as well.
