<p>Creative Commons is conducting a study on the meaning of "NonCommercial" and you can weigh in by answering a detailed questionnaire on the subject. We've extended the deadline for participation to December 14 (originally December 7) as we're still getting <a href="http://netzpolitik.org/2008/ccorg-startet-umfrage-zu-non-commercial/">healthy</a> <a href="http://freeculturenews.com/2008/12/02/cc-announces-noncommercial-questionarre/">response</a> <a href="http://www.cyberlawcentre.org/unlocking-ip/blog/2008/11/what-does-non-commercial-mean-to-you.html">via</a> <a href="http://ocwblog.org/2008/12/05/cc-needs-your-feedback-on-nc-license-by-sunday/">all</a> <a href="http://www.markblevis.com/what-does-non-commercial-use-mean-to-you/">those</a> <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13556_3-10113230-61.html">who</a> <a href="http://www.takepart.com/2008/12/04/take-a-survey-help-creative-commons/">blogged</a> <a href="http://www.rmmlondon.com/archive/noncommercial-creative-commons-crowdsources-opinions/">about</a> <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/03/what-is-noncommercia.html">the</a> <a href="http://blogs.tdl.org/scholarly/2008/12/03/ccs-noncommercial-survey-what-do-you-think-noncommercial-means/">questionnaire</a> <a href="http://kairosnews.org/cc-noncommercial-survey">this</a> <a href="http://isotype.org/2008/12/03/%E2%80%9Cnon-commercial%E2%80%9D-questionnaire-by-creative-commons/">week</a>.</p>
<p><b>Full disclosure:</b> taking the questionnaire requires a significant investment of time -- 15 to 25 minutes, and it isn't an "easy" questionnaire -- you'll have to think. Unfortunately the meaning of "NonCommercial", or at least people's understanding of the term, is a nuanced issue (we'll see what the results actually say about that, after analysis), requiring nuanced, even difficult questions to tease out the sub-issues.  So a huge thanks to those who have participated, and thanks in advance to those who will. If you're ready, <b><a href="http://ur1.ca/y41">go on and take the questionnaire</a></b>.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
