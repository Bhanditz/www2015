<p>A couple quick things: I thought it was cool that blogging software company <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> republished <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/articles/why_content_man.html">an essay by Adaptive Path on the failings of Content Management Systems</a>, all about software of the type Six Apart develops. It's all in accordance with <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a>'s license, which allows commercial redistribution. </p>
<p>Another cool thing was seeing <a href="http://blogcritics.org/">Blogcritics.org</a> do a "featured content of the week" type feature we've done in the past here. <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/04/05/164027.php">Phillip Winn found eight amazing photos at Flickr</a>, and posted links to check them out, all available under Creative Commons licenses.</p>
