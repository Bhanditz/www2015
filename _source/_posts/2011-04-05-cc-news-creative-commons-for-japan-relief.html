<p>March may be over, but the madness isn&#39;t! CC is helping to shape Japan relief efforts, moving offices, and playing an important role in open government.</p>
<p><strong>Japan relief efforts use Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of CC related efforts, we want you to <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26856?utm_campaign=newsletter_1104&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">do what you can to help Japan</a>. But we also think it&#39;s pretty amazing that a number of great relief efforts are using Creative Commons licenses, and you can contribute to them. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/oliveinenglish/">OLIVE</a> is a Wikipedia-like site that provides much-needed information for quake survivors in various languages. With thousands of people displaced from their homes in Japan, many are surviving in make-shift homes and shelters, with scant resources. OLIVE provides practical and creative ways on how to best utilize available resources, such as how to&nbsp;stay warm in a cardboard house. You can help by contributing, editing, or translating articles on OLIVE &ndash; all available for reuse under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/?utm_campaign=newsletter_1104&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=newsletter">CC BY</a>.

<p>Spring is a time for change, as evidenced by our office move. We&#39;re not leaving our hearts in San Francisco, however; we&#39;re taking them plus our innovative spirits with us to Mountain View, California. As of April 1, the CC headquarters will be located in downtown Mountain View to be closer to all the activity brewing in Silicon Valley.
