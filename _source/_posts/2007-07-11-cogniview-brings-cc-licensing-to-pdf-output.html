<p>This has already been picked up by <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/07/free-pdf-writer-software-with-creative.html">at least one</a> blogger, and I've been remiss in not blogging it earlier.  <a href="http://cogniview.com">Cogniview</a> has developed an open source <a href="http://www.cogniview.com/cc-pdf-converter.php">tool</a> for embedding CC license metadata in PDF output.  You can find a screencast and download information <a href="http://www.cogniview.com/cc-pdf-converter.php">on their website</a>.</p>
<p>The CC PDF Converter takes a slightly different approach than most of the other tools we've seen.  It's installed as a Windows printer and allows the user to select a license when they "print" a PDF of their document.  The tool embeds license metadata in the document as <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/XMP">XMP</a> and provides an optional facility for "stamping" the document with visible CC license information -- either as a small image in the header or footer, or as a full-page deed appended to the document.</p>
<p>Some additional details are available on <a href="http://www.cogniview.com/convert-pdf-to-excel/post/announcing-the-creative-commons-pdf-converter/">Cogniview's blog</a>; anyone want to write a similar tool for Mac OS X or Linux?</p>
