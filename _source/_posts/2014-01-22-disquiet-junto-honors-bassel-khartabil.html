<p>We're big fans of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/groups/disquiet-junto/">Disquiet Junto</a>, a group of Creative Commons musicians who create original works and remixes each week around a different theme.</p>
<p>This week, Disquiet Junto is honoring <a href="http://freebassel.org/">Bassel Khartabil</a>, <a href="/weblog/entry/37414">the Syrian CC community leader who's been in prison in Syria since March 2012</a>, with a music project dedicated to Bassel.</p>
<p>From Disquiet Junto:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Thursday, January 23, a special collaborative sound and music project will help raise awareness about Palestinian Syrian programmer and Creative Commons advocate Bassel Khartabil, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012. As the two-year anniversary of Bassel's incarceration approaches, the Disquiet Junto music community on SoundCloud.com will spend four days developing original sound works in Bassel's honor. This week's project will invite musicians to flesh out a work-in-progress that Bassel has, naturally, not been able to complete due to his imprisonment.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Late in the day each Thursday, a new compositional prompt goes out to members of the Disquiet Junto, who then have until 11:59pm the following Monday to submit a piece of music. The Bassel project will be the 108th weekly Disquiet Junto project. As of this date, over 3,000 original pieces of music have been uploaded to the Disquiet Junto group on SoundCloud by over 400 musicians from around the world. The Disquiet Junto began the first week of January 2012, and has continued weekly ever since. Past Disquiet Junto projects include the interpretation of polling data as a graphically notated score, the use of wind chimes as a percussive instrument, the creation of "goodbye music" for the Voyager 1 space probe made from the sounds of interstellar space, and numerous Creative Commons&#8211;inspired remixes of music originally published on netlabels.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The Disquiet Junto was created and is moderated by Marc Weidenbaum, the San Francisco&#8211;based author of the book <em>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</em>, based on the Aphex Twin album of that name. Subscribe to the <a href="https://tinyletter.com/disquiet-junto">Disquiet Junto email announcement list</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update (January 24):</strong> The challenge has now launched. <a href="http://disquiet.com/2014/01/23/disquiet0108-freebassel/">Submit your project by Monday!</a></p>
