<p>On the heels of our recent start of work on licenses in China, Taiwan, and Ireland, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/it/">today we added Italy</a> to the mix. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/discuss#italy">The discussion</a> has just begun, thanks to volunteers at the Department of Law of the University of Turin and the CNR Institute of Electronics and Information and Telecommunications Engineering.</p>
