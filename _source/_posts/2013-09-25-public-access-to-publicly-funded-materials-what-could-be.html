<p><em>This blog post was written by Teresa Sempere GarcÃ­a, CC's Community Support Intern June-August, 2013. The cycle graphics below were designed by Timothy Vollmer and Teresa Sempere GarcÃ­a.</em></p>
<p>The current system for public access to research articles and educational materials is broken: ownership is often unclear, and the reuse of knowledge is limited by policies that do not maximize the impact of public funding. The following graphics will try to simplify and compare two alternative funding cycles for research publications and educational resources that emphasize the positive impacts of open policies on publicly-funded grants.  More information and links to a current directory of current and proposed OER open policies can be found in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OER_Policy_Registry">OER Policy Registry</a> on the Creative Commons Wiki.</p>
<h3>Cycles for Research Articles</h3>
<p>The existing system for producing and distributing publicly funded research articles is expensive and doesn't take advantage of the possibilities of innovations like open licensing.  Without a free-flowing system, access to the results of scientific research is limited to institutions that are able to commit to hefty journal subscriptions -- paid for year after year -- which don't allow for broad redistribution, or repurposing for activities such as text and data mining without additional permissions from the rightsholder. This closed system limits the impact on the scientific and scholarly community and progress is slowed significantly.</p>

<p>When funding cycles for research include open license requirements for publications, increased access and opportunities for reuse extends the value of research funding. As an example, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy requires the published results of all <a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">NIH-funded research</a> to be deposited in PubMed Central's repository, the peer-reviewed manuscript immediately, and the final journal article within twelve months of publication. Similarly, the recent <a href="/weblog/entry/35267" title="White House issues directive supporting public access to publicly fundedÂ research">directive</a> issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy mandates that federal agencies with more than $100 million in research expenditures must make the results of their research publicly available within one year of publication, and better manage the resultant data supporting their results. These policies utilize aspects of the optimized cycle below, and are a step in the right direction for making better use of public funding for research articles.</p>

<h3>Cycles for Educational Resources</h3>
<p>The incumbent system for developing and sharing publicly funded educational resources doesn't guarantee materials are accessible and reusable by the public that paid for their creation.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">A Closed Education Model</h4>

<p>If policies are put in place that mandate open licenses on publicly funded educational resources, knowledge can flow more freely because the public is clear about how they may reuse educational content, and the funders can realize a more impactful return on their investments.  An example of better use of public funding for the production of educational resources, the US <a href="/weblog/entry/26100" title="New federal education fund makes available $2 billion to create OER resources in communityÂ colleges">DOL TAACCCT Program</a> mandates that all content created or modified using grant funds are openly-licensed (CC BY) and deposited in a public repository upon completion of the project. Being conducted in four waves, the TAACCCT program is making better use of a large (US$2 billion) investment of US taxpayer money by ensuring the public will have access the educational resources created during the four-year term, and is able to reuse and adapt them beyond what automatic copyright allows. The following graphic demonstrates an open funding model, with licensing and access recommendations to remove barriers to sharing and help speed access and reuse of publicly funded educational content.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Open policy -- specifically, the idea that publicly funded materials should be openly licensed materials -- is a sensible solution that ensures the public's right to reuse the materials it paid for, and improves the efficiency of government grant funding. Open licensing is a sensible requirement for publicly funded grant programs.</p>
