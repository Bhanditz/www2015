<p><em>Open Science</em> is a bit of an outlier as SXSW panels go, but I've seen lone science presentations go over very well at (computer) technology conferences. I speculate this is because the most computer geeks dreamed of being a scientist as youths but at some point realized they weren't smart or hard working enough to cut it, so having some science at a (computer) technology conference is some good vicarious  fun. Dont' be offended -- I'm projecting.  I liked my proposed panel description better than the brief one posted on the SXSW site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scientists are facing the same issues of openness as programmers and other content creators--but far more complex due to higher financial stakes, in addition to patents, trade secrets and the moral implications within developing nations . Learn how web 2.0, open source and related concepts are changing the way scientists work and how, and how they're being stymied.</p></blockquote>
