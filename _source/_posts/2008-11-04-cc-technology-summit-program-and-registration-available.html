<p>Two months ago we <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9576">announced</a> the second CC Technology Summit, taking place December 12, 2008 in Cambridge, MA at MIT.  The response to the call for presentations was good, and the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-12-12#Program">initial program is now available</a>.  I'm excited about the mix of topics we have on the program.  The day will include reports from our community, including a presentation on copyright registry interoperability by <a href="http://safecreative.org">Safe Creative</a> and <a href="http://registeredcommons.org">Registered Commons</a> and a report from the Queensland Treasury on their use of licensing and metadata.  We'll also have presentations from within CC &mdash; a report on open source knowledge management from Science Commons and an update on what's next for RDFa.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.creativecommons.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=1">Registration</a> is also now open for the event.  While the first Technology Summit was free thanks to Google's generous support, we do have costs associated with the December Technology Summit. To offset those costs, there is a registration fee: $50 for <a href="https://creativecommons.net">CC Network</a> members or $75 for non-members.  If you'd like to sign up for CC Network membership at the same time as you register, we've enabled that as well (no discount, though; $100 total).</p>
<p>It's been a busy year at CC and I'm looking forward to the Technology Summit as an opportunity to review what we've done and look ahead to 2009.</p>
