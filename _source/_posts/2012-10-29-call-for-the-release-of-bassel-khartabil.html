<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/33119">Creative Commons issued a statement in support of Bassel Khartabil</a>, a longtime CC volunteer who has been detained by Syrian authorities since March 15. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/076/2012/en/50fb59c2-c31e-4a98-bd27-61c423c87b38/mde240762012en.html">Amnesty International recently released a document</a> with information suggesting that Bassel has been ill-treated and even tortured. This morning, <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Call-for-release-of-Bassel-to-President-signed.pdf">we sent a letter</a> to President Bashar al-Assad, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mu'allim, and Minister of Defense 'Imad al-Fraij; urging that Bassel be released unless he is promptly charged with an internationally recognized criminal offense. We urge Syrian authorities to grant Bassel immediate access to his family, a lawyer of his choice, and all necessary medical treatment.</p>
<p>Bassel has played a crucial role in the open technology and culture communities, both in Syria and around the world. Through his service as <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Syria">Creative Commons' project lead in Syria</a> and his numerous contributions to the advancement of open source and related technologies, Bassel has spent his career working toward a more free Internet. Many of us at Creative Commons have become friends of Bassel's over the years. All of us have benefited from his leadership and expertise.</p>
<p>Please stand with us in support of Bassel. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/076/2012/en/50fb59c2-c31e-4a98-bd27-61c423c87b38/mde240762012en.html">Amnesty International has provided instructions</a> for contacting Syrian authorities.
