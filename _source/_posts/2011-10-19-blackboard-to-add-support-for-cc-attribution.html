<p>Blackboard, the popular Learning Management System (LMS), has announced that they will build in support for CC licensing, specifically enabling instructors the ability to publish and share their course materials under the CC Attribution (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>) license. From the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackboard-launches-new-open-education-initiatives-132124278.html">press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Support for OER enables instructors to publish and share their courses under a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY) so that anyone can easily preview and download the course content in Blackboard and Common Cartridge formats. The new functionality is available now for CourseSites, Blackboard's free, fully-hosted and supported cloud offering launched a year ago and now used by over 18,000 instructors from nearly 12,000 institutions in 113 countries. Similar support for OER will be available soon for Blackboard Learn."</p></blockquote>

The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> and <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/10/19/in_wake_of_pearson_openclass_unveiling_blackboard_announces_oer_support">Inside Higher Ed</a> also covered Blackboard's move toward openness in education. Cable Green, CC's Director of Global Learning, notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>"The core part of any OER is an open license, and Blackboard has shown its leadership by empowering instructors to share so others can revise, reuse, remix and redistribute their courses."</p></blockquote>
