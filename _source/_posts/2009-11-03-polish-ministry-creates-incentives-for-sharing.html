<p>The Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (MKiDN) <a href="http://mk.gov.pl/po2010/edukacja_kulturalna.php">just announced</a> a range of grant programs for the year 2010, including the program "Cultural Education". Thanks to the efforts of the <a href="http://koed.org.pl/">Coalition for Open Education (KOED)</a> and the cooperation of Ministry officials, the program includes for the first time incentives to release educational content under free licenses. Grant proposals will receive up to 10% of all possible points for making project results publicly available, <strong>with additional points given to projects "publishing works online with a right to re-use, for instance through one of the free licenses."</strong></p>
<p>The Ministry's Cultural Education program is the first of its kind in Poland to encourage grant recipients to freely and publicly share educational content. The program, with a budget of 11,5 million Polish zloty (about 4 million Euro), will fund educational projects that promote creativity and self-expression, as well as provide children and youth with extra-curricular artistic education.</p>
<p>KOED is coalition formed by one of CC Polandâ€™s affiliate institutions, the <a href="http://www.icm.edu.pl/">Interdisciplinary Center for Modelling at University of Warsaw</a>, and colleagues <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stowarzyszenie_Wikimedia_Polska">Wikimedia Polska Association</a>, <a href="http://www.nowoczesnapolska.org.pl/">Foundation Modern Poland</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ebib.info/">Polish Librarians Association</a>. We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11979">blogged</a> about its inception in January 2009.</p>
