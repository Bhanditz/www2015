<p>Last week, the Creative Commons licences were presented by Massimo Travostino at the <a href="http://liberamente.hipatia.info/">Settimana delle liberta</a> in Florence, Italy. The week-long conference also featured presentations by Richard Stallman of the <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">FSF</a> and Sergio Amadeu of the Brazilian <a href="http://www.iti.br/">Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia da Informa&#x00E7;&#x00E3;o</a>. The Italian mailing list - where the local draft licences are currently being discussed under the guidance of Professor Ricolfi- is one of the most active within iCommons.
