<p>Yesterday Yahoo! announced that their search index had <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000172.html">grown to 20 billion documents</a>. That, along with continued adoption of Creative Commons licenses, explains 53 million linkbacks to our licenses according to Yahoo! linkback queries. In May, when Yahoo!'s index apparently consisted of 8 billion documents, we found <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5456">16 million pages with license links</a>. So discounting the growth of Yahoo!'s index, the number of Creative Commons license links have increased by approximately one third in the past three months alone -- 53/(16*(20/8)) = 1.325. Take the exact numbers with a lump of salt, but the indication of growth is impressive nonetheless.</p>
