<p>Independent childrens recording artist <a href="http://www.zakmorgan.com/">Zak Morgan</a>'s <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/zakmorgan2">second album</a> was nominated for Grammy this year. The amazing part is that he is without any label backing: he produces his own albums, coordinates his own tours, and sells his CDs along the way. <a href="http://cdbaby.org/stories/03/12/29/2547596.html">In this posting to CDBaby's site</a>, he tells the story of how he went from struggling musician to successful musician to Grammy-nominated musician. Long story short: it involves <strong>a lot</strong> of hard work and planning to get gigs and takes a lot of savings to pay for a professional production.
