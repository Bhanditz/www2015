<p>In November we <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768">released</a> version 4.0 of the Creative Commons license suite, and today the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/advisory-council/">Open Definition Advisory Council</a> approved the CC 4.0 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Attribution (BY)</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA)</a> International licenses as conformant with the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Open Definition sets out principles that define â€œopennessâ€ in relation to data and content...It can be summed up in the statement that: <em>â€œA piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it â€” subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.â€</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Prior versions of Creative Commons BY and BY-SA licenses (1.0 - 3.0, including jurisdiction ports) are also aligned with the Open Definition, as is the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 Public Domain Dedication</a>. Hereâ€™s the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">complete list</a> of conformant licenses. None of the Creative Commons NonCommercial or NoDerivatives licenses comply with the Definition. </p>
<p>The Open Definition is an important marker that communicates the fundamental legal conditions that make content and data open, and CC is working on ways to better display which of our licenses conform to the Definition. We appreciate the open and participatory process conducted by the Open Definition Advisory Council in <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/">evaluating licenses</a> and providing expert assistance and advice to license stewards. Individuals interested in participating in the Open Definition license review process may join the <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/od-discuss">OD-discuss email list</a>. </p>
