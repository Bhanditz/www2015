<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/creativecommons/discuss/72157604237046599/">Calling all Flickr photographers and CC-licensors</a> - we are compiling a list of interesting and/or unique stories of re-use of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/creativecommons/">CC-licensed photos on Flickr</a> and we need your help! </p>
<p>If you or someone you know has had their photographs reused in an intriguing way, please send  the story and corresponding photograph to <em>melissa AT creativecommons DOT org</em>. This is super significant in helping us explain to the larger community why CC is important for photographers. We have a short time frame and any help from those in the CC community is greatly appreciated!</p>
