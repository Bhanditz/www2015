<p>Are you a creative professional who frequently finds yourself using Google Image search or the Flickr commons portal to discover new images? <a href="http://www.picscout.com">PicScout</a>, a company specializing in image recognition software, is working on a Firefox extension called <a href="http://picscout.com/solutions/image-exchange-addon.html">ImageExchange</a> that they want your help to beta test.  Right now the program is in closed beta, but they've already implemented support for recognizing images licensed with our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attibution Non-Commercial license</a>.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? If you come across a CC BY-NC licensed photo anywhere on the web, PicScout's <a href="http://picscout.com/solutions/imageexchange.html">ImageExchange</a> extension will recognize it and give you what it believes is the source URL on Flickr. Here's a screenshot to give you the idea of the results from <a href="http://images.google.com/images?imgtbs=r&as_st=y&gbv=2&as_rights=%28cc_noncommercial%29&hl=en&sa=1&q=flowers+flickr&aq=f&oq=&aqi=&start=0">a search for "flowers" on Google Images</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Screen-shot-2009-10-26-at-11.38.51-AM.png"><img src="img/Screen-shot-2009-10-26-at-11.38.51-AM.png" alt="PicScout Image Exchange Screenshot" title="PicScout Image Exchange Screenshot" width="600" height="564" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18772" /></a></p>
<p>The important part to understand is that PicScout's extension can recognize photos anywhere on the web -- from Google Image Search results to a blog you stumble across. When you click the round information button at the top right of the thumbnails that it recognizes, you'll get a dialog box with more information. If PicScout believes the photo is CC BY-NC licensed and from Flickr, it will point you to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48889123125@N01/3724054408/">the photo's original page on Flickr</a>. PicScout also recognizes <a href="http://picscout.com/solutions/imageexchange.html">rights-managed and micro-stock images from various industry databases as well.</a> This allows image re-users to get in touch directly with the owner of the photo and secure commercial rights to use it.</p>
<p>Recognizing commons content and identifying its original source is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/10061">an important part of our community</a> and it's something we've been thinking a lot about. Take for example, the vigilant editors and administrators of <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a>, which serves as the multimedia backend for all of the Wikipedia projects. A good portion of their time <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Copyright_violations">is spent weeding out copyright violations from the newly uploaded content to the project</a>. If they had an easy way to determine whether an incoming photo was freely CC licensed, public domain, or All Rights Reserved, their jobs could be a lot easier.  While PicScout's ImageExchange is only indexing CC BY-NC licensed photos (which Wikipedia doesn't accept anyway), we're looking forward to seeing the database expand its reach into other domains in order to serve more and more communities.</p>
<p>For now, if you're a creative professional searching the web for new images to use in your day-to-day work, <a href="http://imagex.picscout.com/Download/Register">sign up with Pic Scout's ImageExchange beta program today</a>!</p>
