<p>In preparation for the <a href="http://www.icmc2005.org/news.php?selectedPage=2/">International Computer Music Conference</a> to be held in Barcelona in September 2005, the <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/eng/">Music Technology Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.upf.es/">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>, have created the <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/index.php">freesoundproject</a>. The freesound project is a collaborative database of sounds - not songs or compositions - but sounds: audio snippets, samples, recordings, bleeps. All sounds uploaded to the site must be licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/">Creative Commons Sampling Plus license</a>. The site has already collected a range of diverse sounds - from instrumental pieces to balloon sounds - and offers sample packs, remixes and groovy waveform images of the sounds. The database is going to continue to exist, collect sounds and make them available after the conference - the conference is just the impetus for getting the project started. It's a great example of building out the creative commons!</p>
