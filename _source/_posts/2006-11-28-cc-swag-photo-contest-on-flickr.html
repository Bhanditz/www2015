<p>Use your photographic skills to show your support for Creative Commons! Take a cool, creative picture of your favorite CC swag (t-shirts, buttons, stickers, etc. â€” all available from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/store">Support the Commons store</a>) and upload it to your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> account. Two winners will have their photos used on Creative Commons' informational postcards, which will be distributed internationally to promote CC and the winning photographers. Winners will receive 100 copies of the postcard with their photo. The winners will also be able to choose a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people">Creative Commons board member</a> to record a personalized outgoing voicemail announcement â€” that's right, your friends can be greeted by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people#0">Lawrence Lessig</a> every time they call you!</p>
