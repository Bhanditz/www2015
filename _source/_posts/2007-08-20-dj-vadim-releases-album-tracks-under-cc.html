<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7557">As promised</a> BBE Music and Creative Commons have taken the first step in our new relationship. And what a step: DJ Vadim has released all the original solo instrumental and a cappella tracks for his latest album "<a href="http://www.bbemusic.com/djvadim/">The Sound Catcher</a>." No contest, no prizes, just the tracks out there in the Commons through a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial</a> license for remixers to use. Legally. Safely.</p>
<p>From Ben Dawson at BBE: "Tracks from many of our new releases and back-catalogue are being uploaded to ccMixter. We know how well you all produce and we want to see what will happen! Unleashing some great performances from live instrumentalist and vocalists and sitting back to see what will emerge."</p>
<p>We've been saying for a long time that this type of activity was inevitable but it still takes your breath away when it actually happens.</p>
<p>Remixers head on over to the <a href="http://ccmixter.org/bbe">ccMixter/BBE download page</a>. Everyone else can monitor the remixes using <a href="http://ccmixter.org/media/api/query?remixesof=djvadim&amp;f=rss&amp;limit=25">this RSS feed link</a>.</p>
