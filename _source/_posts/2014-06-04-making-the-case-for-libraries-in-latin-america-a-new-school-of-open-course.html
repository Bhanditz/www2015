<p><a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2178/abc-del-derecho-de-autor-para-bibliotecarios-de-am%C3%A9rica-latina/">ABC of Copyright for Librarians in Latin America</a>, or <em>ABC del derecho de autor para bibliotecarios de AmÃ©rica Latina</em>, is a free, online course that launches today as part of the <a href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/">School of Open</a>. This Spanish language course seeks to help librarians and library users strengthen their knowledge of copyright laws in Latin America and the challenges that exist to access to information in the 21st century.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://internetactiva.net/?p=268">launch announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Public library seeks to provide equal opportunities in access to information, knowledge, recreation, culture, education, reading and writing for all their users. However, there are currently no minimum guarantees that allow libraries and archives carrying out activities related to their mission such as lending books or changing the format of a film (e.g. VHS to digital) for preservation purposes. For decades, protections for authors and/or rightsholders have been increased, while the guarantees of access and inclusion of copyright balances are at the mercy of political will.<br />
...<br />
This imbalance occurs especially in developing countries, as many developed countries have already generated standards seeking to better balance copyright.</p></blockquote>
<p>To address these challenges, CC affiliates from Colombia, El Salvador and Uruguay, in collaboration with the Karisma Foundation, have developed a course for librarians, archivists, educators, university researchers, and anyone else in the Latin American region interested in these issues. <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2178/abc-del-derecho-de-autor-para-bibliotecarios-de-am%C3%A9rica-latina/">ABC of copyright for librarians in Latin America</a> is designed to strengthen the understanding of basic copyright concepts through examples, analysis and open models based on Latin American cases and legislation.</p>
<p>The course officially launches online on <a href="http://internetactiva.net/?page_id=17">Internet Activa</a> at 5pm Colombia time today (UTC-5). You can join the launch by filling out <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/creativecommons.org/forms/d/1g4id2JO84KcT4mufJ5AVh7wbOek4QrslZyHuQ8K_EtA/viewform">this form</a> expressing your intent; however, registration to participate in the course is not required.</p>
