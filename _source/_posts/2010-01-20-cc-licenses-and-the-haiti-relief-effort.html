<p>In the immediate aftermath of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a> a number of  efforts were put in place to connect survivors with their family and loved ones. In all its good intention, this lead to numerous websites that, in the words of Marc Fest of the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a>, became "silos" of information with no ability to interact. As a result, Fest - who is VP of Communications - sent an impassioned plea to news organizations to utilize an <a href="http://haiticrisis.appspot.com/">open-source Google app</a> that was not only collecting similar information but releasing the data under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution license</a> - from <a href="http://pndblog.typepad.com/pndblog/2010/01/haiti-relief-media-lab-request-re-google-peoplefinding-app.html">PhilanTopic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We recognize that many newspapers have put precious resources into developing a people-finder system. We nonetheless urge them to make their data available to the Google project and standardize on the Google widget.  Doing so will greatly increase the number of successful reunions. Data from the Google site is currently available as "dumps" in the standard PFIF format...and an API is being developed and licensed through Creative Commons. I am not affiliated with Google -- indeed, this is a volunteer initiative by some of their engineers -- but this is one case where their reach and capacity can help the most people.</p></blockquote>
<p>A similar effort has been taken up by <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/">Architecture for Humanity</a>. Already <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7026">known</a> for their use of CC licenses, AFH is <a href="http://architectureforhumanity.org/updates/2010-01-17-haiti-quake-a-plan-for-reconstruction">proposing a plan</a> to build Community Resource Centers - centralized locales that will operate as base points for greater building relief through out Haiti. All of the work produced in these recovery centers would be released under a CC license, mirroring similar centers that were built in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>In both efforts, there is a distinct desire to keep relief efforts fluid and focused on helping people, a goal assisted by keeping valuable information open, free, and widely usable. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cameron-sinclair/haiti-quake-a-plan-for-re_b_426413.html">Put succinctly</a> by AFH co-founder Cameron Sinclair, "there is no 'ownership' in rebuilding lives."</p>
