<p>The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has adopted a university-wide open educational resources (OER) policy with <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC Attribution</a> as the default license for university material. KNUST's "<a href="http://knust.edu.gh/downloads/20/20411.pdf">Policy for Development and Use of Open Educational Resources (OER)</a>" (pdf) outlines the purpose, role, and process of OER production at the university, and specifically states that,<br />
<blockquote>"Materials produced which do not indicate any specific conditions for sharing will automatically be considered to have been shared under a Creative Commons Attribution license."</p></blockquote>
<p> The policy is available at the <a href="http://knust.edu.gh/pages/sections.php?siteid=knust&mid=14&sid=94&id=776">KNUST website</a> and, in line with their policy, is available for use under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a>. </p>
<p>KNUST is a partner institution in the <a href="http://www.oerafrica.org/healthoer">African Health OER Network</a> and works closely with the University of Michigan Medical School and Dental School to develop and distribute health OER. KNUST OER is hosted at <a href="http://web.knust.edu.gh/oer">http://web.knust.edu.gh/oer</a> but is also duplicated for use at the <a href="https://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/">Open.Michigan</a> and <a href="http://www.oerafrica.org/healthoer/HealthOERHome/tabid/151/Default.aspx">OER Africa</a> sites.</p>
