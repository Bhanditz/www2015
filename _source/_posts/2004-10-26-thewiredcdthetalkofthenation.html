<p>So to speak. <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/">Tune in to NPR</a> today for a special program about the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired">WIRED CD</a>. Out here in the Pacific US time zone, it's slated for 12:30pm, but you may want to check the <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/">Talk of the Nation</a> site for airtime in your area.</p>
