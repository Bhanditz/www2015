<h2>More about the Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.utpl.edu.ec/"><img src="img/logo-universidad-tecnica-particular-de-loja.jpg" alt="logo-universidad-tecnica-particular-de-loja.jpg" width="199" height="135" align="right" /></a><br />
The Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja was founded by the Ecuadorian Marist Association (AME) on May 3rd, 1971.</p>
<p>UTPL was officially recognized by the State of Ecuador under Executive Decree 646, published in the Official Register Nr. 217 of May 5th, 1971, in which it was constituted as an autonomous legal entity on the basis of the â€œModus Vivendiâ€ Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Ecuador, following the Churchâ€™s regulations in its organization and government.</p>
<p>On October 27th, 1997, the Diocese of Loja transferred indefinitely to the â€œIdente Association of Christ the Redeemer, Idente Missionariesâ€ the operation of the Universidad TÃ©cnica Particular de Loja, to be conducted with total autonomy and in accordance with Idente charisma.</p>
<p>In 1976 the UTPL inaugurated the Distance Education Modality, the first in Latin America. The current statute, approved by the National Council of Higher Education, CONESUP, on January 30th, 2002, established that the institution would offer higher education at undergraduate and graduate levels through the following modalities: Traditional, and Open and Distance, with its variants: a) Traditional Distance; b) Mixed Mode; and c) Virtual.</p>
<p>The UTPL educational model is centered on â€œProductive Entrepreneurshipâ€ in which the students and the professors take part in real projects in the Centers for Research, Technology Transfer, Extension and Service (CITTES)</p>
<p>In summary, the academic life of UTPL combines all the dimensions of the university: the CITTES, the Schools, their programs in the Traditional and Distance Modalities, and service to society, with a strong humanist perspective.</p>
