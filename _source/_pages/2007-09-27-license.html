<h2>Review Conditions</h2>
<p>Creators choose a set of conditions they wish to apply to their work.</p>
<p><img src="img/attrib.gif" alt="Attribution" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" border="0" height="32" width="32" /> <strong>Attribution</strong>. You let others copy, distribute, display, and perform your copyrighted work â€”  and derivative works based upon it â€”  but only if they give credit the way you request.</p>
<p><img src="img/noncomm.gif" alt="Noncommercial" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" border="0" height="32" width="32" /> <strong>Noncommercial</strong>. You let others copy, distribute, display, and perform your work â€” and derivative works based upon it â€” but for noncommercial purposes only.</p>
<p><img src="img/nomod.gif" alt="No Derivative Works" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" border="0" height="32" width="32" /> <strong>No Derivative Works</strong>.  You let others copy, distribute, display, and perform only verbatim copies of your work, not derivative works based upon it.</p>
<p><img src="img/standard.gif" alt="Share Alike" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px" border="0" height="32" width="32" /> <strong>Share Alike</strong>.  You allow others to distribute derivative works only under a license identical to the license that governs your work.</p>
<h2>Select License</h2>
<p>Select the license that indicates how others may use your creative work.</p>
<h3>Attribution (by)</h3>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; width:15em;"><img src="img/standard.gif" alt="by" border="0" /><br />
<a href="/license/results-one?license_code=by">Choose by license</a></div>
<p>This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered, in terms of what others can do with your works licensed under Attribution.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Read the Commons Deed</a> | <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode">View Legal Code</a></p>
<h3>Attribution Share Alike (by-sa)</h3>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; width:15em;"><img src="img/standard.gif" alt="by" border="0" /><img src="img/standard.gif" alt="nd" border="0" /><br />
<a href="/license/results-one?license_code=by-sa">Choose by-sa license</a></div>
<p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial reasons, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.</p>

<h3>Attribution No Derivatives (by-nd)</h3>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; width:15em;"><img src="img/standard.gif" alt="by" border="0" />  <img src="img/standard.gif" alt="nc" border="0" /><br />
<a href="/license/results-one?license_code=by-nd">Choose by-nd license</a></div>
<p>This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.</p>

<h3>Attribution Non-commercial (by-nc)</h3>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; width:15em;"> <img src="img/standard.gif" alt="by" border="0" />  <img src="img/standard.gif" alt="nc" border="0" /><br />
<a href="/license/results-one?license_code=by-nc">Choose by-nc license</a></div>
<p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don't have to license their derivative works on the same terms.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Read the Commons Deed</a> | <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/legalcode">View Legal Code</a></p>
<h3>Attribution Non-commercial Share Alike (by-nc-sa)</h3>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center; width:15em;"><img src="img/standard.gif" alt="by" border="0" />  <img src="img/standard.gif" alt="nc" border="0" /> <img src="img/standard.gif" alt="nd" border="0" /><br /><a href="/license/results-one?license_code=by-nc-sa">Choose by-nc-sa license</a></div>
<p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. Others can download and redistribute your work just like the by-nc-nd license, but they can also translate, make remixes, and produce new stories based on your work. All new work based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also be non-commercial in nature.</p>

<h3>Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives (by-nc-nd)</h3>

<p>This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, allowing redistribution. This license is often called the "free advertising" license because it allows others to download your works and share them with others as long as they mention you and link back to you, but they can't change them in any way or use them commercially.</p>

<h2>Your license choice will be expressed in three ways:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Commons Deed</strong>. A plain-language summary of the license, complete with the relevant icons.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Code</strong>. The fine print that you need to be sure the license will stand up in court.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Code</strong>. A machine-readable translation of the license that helps search engines and other applications identify your work by its terms of use.</li>
</ol>
