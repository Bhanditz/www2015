<p>The more we understand about science and its complexities, the more important it is for scientific data to be shared openly. Itâ€™s not useful to have ten different labs doing the same research and not sharing their results; likewise, weâ€™re much more likely to be able to pinpoint diseases if we have genomic data from a large pool of individuals. Since 2004, weâ€™ve been <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Science">focusing our efforts</a> to expand the use of Creative Commons licenses to scientific and technical research.</p>

<h3>PLOS</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.plos.org/">PLOS</a> (Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit scientific and medical publishing venture that provides scientists and physicians with high-quality, high-profile journals in which to publish their most important work. Under the open access model, PLOS journals are immediately available online, with no charges for access and no restrictions on subsequent redistribution or use, as long as the author(s) and source are cited, as specified by the Creative Commons Attribution License.

<h3>BioMed Central</h3>
<p><a href="http://biomedcentral.com">BioMed Central</a> is an STM (Science, Technology and Medicine) publisher which has pioneered the open access publishing model, and was acquired by Springer Verlag in 2008. All original research articles published by BioMed Central are made freely and permanently accessible online immediately upon publication. BioMed Central views open access to research as essential in order to ensure the rapid and efficient communication of research findings.

<h3>PLOS Blogs</h3>
<p>PLOS Blogs was set up to bring a select group of independent science and medicine bloggers together with the editors and staff who run the independent network made up of writers who love science and medicine, and scientists and physicians that love to write. Here, youâ€™ll find an equal mix of blogs from journalists and researchers tackling diverse issues in science and medicine. All content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license.

<h3>Personal Genome Project</h3>
<p>The Personal Genome Project hopes to make personal genome sequencing more affordable, accessible, and useful for humankind. Volunteers make their full sequence genomes, information about their health, and a line of stem cells derived from their bodies available for all research and commercial purposes. CC0 is used to free the data and health information, and our Materials Transfer Agreements keep the lines of stem cells in the commons.

<h2 id="open access">Open Access</h2>
<h3 class="light">The <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/">Scholarsâ€™ Copyright Project</a></h3>
<p>Creative Commons plays an instrumental role in the Open Access movement, which is making scholarly research and journals more widely available on the Web. The worldâ€™s largest Open Access publishers in the world all use CC licenses to publish their content online.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re also expanding Open Access to research institutions. Creative Commons licenses are directly integrated into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_repository">institutional repository</a> software platforms like <a href="http://www.dspace.org/">DSpace</a> and <a href="http://www.eprints.org/">ePrints</a>. University libraries at MIT, Johns Hopkins, and Carnegie Mellon offer access to our <a href="http://scholars.sciencecommons.org/">Scholarâ€™s Copyright Addendum Engine</a>, which helps faculty members upload their research for public use while retaining the rights they want to keep.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve created <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/advocacy/nih/copyright.shtml">policy briefings</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/opendoors_v1.pdf">guidelines</a> to help institutions implement Open Access into their frameworks.</p>
<h2>Open Data</h2>
<p>At Creative Commons, we believe scientific data should be freely available to everyone. We call this idea Open Data. Creative Commons legal tools can be used to make data and databases freely available. Weâ€™ve already had successful implementations in <a href="http://www.eol.org/">taxonomic</a>, <a href="http://en.openei.org/wiki/Main_Page">energy</a>, <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/">genomics</a>, <a href="http://sagebase.org/">disease research</a>, <a href="http://wiki.americaview.org/display/miview/Home">geospatial</a>, <a href="http://www.polarcommons.org/">polar</a>, and <a href="http://openbiblio.net/2010/11/17/jisc-openbibliography-british-library-data-release/">bilbiometric</a> disciplines, and are providing guidance to funders, institutions, private foundations, governments, the corporate sector, and other stakeholders. Read more about <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Data">Creative Commons and data</a>.</p>
<h2>R&amp;D</h2>
<p>The commons doesn't begin and end with copyrighted works. We think open research materials are vital to innovation, not just data and documents; to that end, weâ€™ve developed and deployed CC-inspired legal tools for<a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/licensing/"> transferring biological materials</a>. For example, the <a href="http://personalgenomes.org/">Personal Genome Project</a> licensed 1,000 lines of stem cells under CCâ€™s<a href="http://mta.sciencecommons.org/agreements/sc-ou/2.0/"> Materials Transfer Agreement</a>,Â <a href="http://ccr.coriell.org/Sections/Collections/CHDI/?SsId=45">CHDIâ€™s repository of Huntingtons Disease research tools</a>. And we have built a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Patent_Tools_Public_Discussion">public patent licensing conversation</a> through our involvement inÂ theÂ <a href="http://greenxchange.cc/">GreenXchange project</a>.</p>
<p>We have also invested years in researching the realities of re-using open data at web scale through our <a href="http://neurocommons.org">Neurocommons</a> project, which serves integrated life sciences databases and open-source software essential for re-using data.</p>
