<h2>License</h2>
<h3>License Your Work</h3>
<p>Creative Commons licenses would do little without enthusiastic use by creators across disciplines. If youâ€™ve created any sort of copyrightable material, such as video, text, images, websites or blogs, license them! See the <a href="/about/license/">select license page</a> for information about choosing a license.</p>
<h3>Marking Standards</h3>
<p>In many cases (blogs, web-based text), the standard CC licence button will be appropriate for designating your work with the freedoms you wish to carry. In certain mediums, this isn't the case. In order to make sure your audience understands the license you have chosen, follow our <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking">marking standards</a> on how to correctly label your respective work.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Creative Commons stays alive because of donations and other gifts from our community. Please help <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support">support Creative Commons and grow the commons</a>!</p>
<h2>Look & Listen</h2>
<h3>Media Publishing</h3>
<p>We have profiles on many of the major media-sharing websites, check out where on the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Media">wiki</a>.</p>
<h3>Content Curators</h3>

<h2>Congregate & Communicate</h2>
<h3>Social Networks</h3>

<h3>CC Salons</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Salon">CC Salon</a> is a bi-monthly event focused on building a community of artists and developers around Creative Commons licenses, standards, and technology. Although started in San Francisco, due to vigor of the CC community, more and more Salons are popping up around the world all the time. Be sure to check if there is a Salon in your city. If not, and you are interested in starting one, let us know so we can help you out w/ some schwag and publicity!</p>
<h3>Conferences</h3>
<p>Creative Commons is a small nonprofit. CC presents at several conferences a year, but our staff is limited. We often need other CC community members to help us at conferences by helping present projects, fliers, and other issues. For more information, please check the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Conference">conference page</a> on the wiki.</p>
<h3>Local Outreach</h3>
<p>Integrating CC into local communities is one of the best ways to help spread CC's mission. As always, evangelize amongst your peers, family, and friends to your best abilities! Informal person-to-person discussions are a great way to spread the word about CC - if you need talking points, check out our <a href="/about">about page</a>. For more detailed ideas and examples, check out <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Local_Outreach">the local outreach page</a> on the wiki.</p>
<h3>Discussion and Communication</h3>
<p>We have a number of <a href="/contact#discussion">active discussion lists</a> that serve as phenomenal gateways into the CC community, primarily in terms of development. While our weblog remains the general discussion area for news and developments at Creative Commons, the discussion lists should be seen as the laboratories where you can help make new and exciting CC development ideas real. Also, <a href="/contact#discussion">see the same page</a> for information about our development chat channel and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/">public wiki</a>. If that doesn't suffice, go ahead and <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Lawyer">Lawyers</a></h3>
