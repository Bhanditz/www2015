You will be responsible for securing the resources and relationships necessary to fulfill our vision to realize the full potential of the Internet â€” universal access to research and education, full participation in culture â€” to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity. Our reach is global and our ambitions are far-reaching â€” youâ€™re going to have your work cut out for you.</p>

<p><strong>Goals and Targets</strong><br />
Sustainability and diversification of revenue are our immediate goals in development, followed by growth and exploration of areas of opportunity and interest to fulfill our mission. For individuals, we are starting with a small, dedicated base, and will need to aggressively drive list growth and professional fundraising. With hundreds of millions of CC licensed works, and strong corporate platform partners, raising at a minimum $1M in new individual small-dollar donations is an attainable goal in the first 2 years. The successful candidate will outline a plan for how they will use their skills and experience to realize this goal, and set targets for corporate and grant revenues to meet the organizationâ€™s needs.</p>
