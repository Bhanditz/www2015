<p>There&#8217;s no right or wrong Creative Commons license. That said, some licenses are more appropriate for some applications than others--for example, only the free licenses (CC0, BY, BY-SA) should be used for public sector information. Sometimes licensors mistakenly think that the license they're using allows types of reuse that it actually restricts, or vice versa. For more information on this problem, <a href="/freeworks">see our page on the differences between free and non-free licenses</a>.</p>
<p>When deciding which license to apply to your work, ask yourself what types of reuse you'd like to encourage, and license accordingly.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve chosen examples of users of each CC license, as well as the CC0 Public Domain Dedication, with information about why each licensor selected the license she did. While there are always arguments to be made for different licenses, we think that these examples serve as good illustrations of the various factors that licensors often take into account when choosing which license to use.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.europeana.eu/">Europeana</a></h3>
<p>Europeana&#160;&#8212; Europe&#8217;s digital library&#160;&#8212; <a href="//weblog/entry/34017">releases its metadata into the public domain using CC0</a>. This massive dataset consists of descriptive information from a huge trove of digitized cultural and artistic works. By removing all restrictions on the use of the metadata that describes these cultural works, Europeana creates opportunities for developers, designers, and other digital innovators to create applications, games for mobile devices, and websites that visualize and represent the diverse collection of artistic works in Europeana.</p>

<h3><a href="http://figshare.com/">figshare</a></h3>
<p>figshare allows researchers to publish all of their research outputs in an easily citable, searchable, shareable manner. Figshare has adopted CC0 as the default tool for researchers to share their datasets. In many cases, it can be difficult to ascertain whether a database is subject to copyright law, as many types of data aren&#8217;t copyrightable in many jurisdictions. Putting a database or dataset in the public domain under CC0 is a way to remove any legal doubt about whether researchers can use the data in their projects. Hundreds of organizations use CC0 to dedicate their work to the public domain. Although CC0 doesn&#8217;t legally require users of the data to cite the source, it does not affect the ethical norms for attribution in scientific and research communities.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/">Open Goldberg Variations</a></h3>
<p>Before the Open Goldberg Variations, public domain recordings of Bach&#8217;s Goldberg Variations were hard to find, even though the scores themselves were in the public domain. Open Goldberg Variations wanted to change that, so it teamed up with professional musician Kimiko Ishizaka and started a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/293573191/open-goldberg-variations-setting-bach-free">Kickstarter project</a> to create studio-quality recordings, promising to release them into the public domain using the CC0 public domain dedication tool. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/293573191/open-goldberg-variations-setting-bach-free">According to the project founders</a>, &#8220;Musicians are usually not willing to withdraw their copyrights and their control over usage, but we feel that they thus miss opportunities to contribute to the greater good and benefit from wider distribution of their works. If this project succeeds, we hope that the recording will be available to everyone forevermore, and that it will be a truly widely known and enjoyed artistic work.&#8221; Sure enough, the project was funded at nearly double its original funding goal, and as a result all 30 variations performed by Kimiko Ishizaka are now available for free download via CC0.</p>

<p>In 2003, the Public Library of Science (PLOS) launched a nonprofit scientific and medical publishing venture that provides scientists and physicians with high-quality, high-profile journals in which to publish their most important work. Under the Open Access model, PLOS journals are immediately available online, with no charges for access and no restrictions on subsequent redistribution or use, as long as the author(s) and source are cited, as specified by the Creative Commons Attribution License. PLOS publishes approximately 50,000 CC BY articles every year. <a href="/weblog/entry/35545">Says former PLOS CEO Peter Jerram</a>, &#8220;The work of Creative Commons ensures that [other projects] can use the papers we publish without requiring the additional time and cost that asking special permissions would require.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chris Zabriskie is an artist who specializes in cinematic soundscapes, ambient piano compositions, and minimal synth music. Originally a user of the the <a href="/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC Attribution-Noncommercial license</a>, Chris decided to drop the Noncommercial clause from his work, opting for CC BY. <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/member/chriszabriskie/blog/Why_I_Went_CC_BY">He explains his reasoning</a>: &#8220;There are 48 hours of new video being uploaded just to YouTube every minute. Somebody, somewhere, always needs music for their project. Let people do what they want with your music, and they&#8217;ll promote you.&#8221; Zabriskie describes how his decision paid off in ways he never expected: &#8220;I&#8217;ve scored several feature films, a number of shorts, and am doing a bunch of other contract work for people and projects all around the world.&#8221; His inbox was flooded with requests from fellow creators, and he keeps a list of clients that includes the Cartoon Network, New York Public Library, Gizmodo, and Mashable alongside independent feature films and shorts.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons</a></h3>
<p>Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites allow content to legally flow in and out with ease, enabling one of the great cultural resources of the digital revolution to legally interact with an endless array of works from similar cultural institutions. Says Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, &#8220;Creative Commons is about building infrastructure for a new kind of culture&#160;&#8212; one that is both a folk culture, and wildly more sophisticated than anything before it.&#8221; Much of the media that accompanies Wikipedia articles, such as photos and illustrations, are also licensed under CC BY-SA or a more liberal license.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a></h3>
<p>Arduino is an open-source computing chip &#8220;that can sense and control more of the physical world than your desktop computer.&#8221; It consists of a microcontroller board (the hardware) and the language that programs the board (the software). The software is under an open source software (OSS) license, and the reference designs for the hardware are under a CC BY-SA license, because <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/FAQ">Arduino creators believe</a> &#8220;that people should be able to study our hardware to understand how it works, make changes to it, and share those changes.&#8221; Thanks to CC BY-SA, anyone can modify the designs, reproduce as many microcontroller boards as they like, and make money off of the modifications&#160;&#8212; as long as the derivative designs are published under the same license. Because everything about Arduino is open, Arduino chips have become the de-facto computing chip for open-source hardware makers and have become the processing power behind numerous creations, including open source synthesizers, MP3 players, guitar amplifiers, and even high-end voice-over-IP phone routers.</p>

<h3><a href="https://p2pu.org/">P2PU</a></h3>
<p>The Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is a grassroots open education project that organizes learning outside of institutional walls and gives learners recognition for their achievements. By leveraging the Internet and open educational resources (OER), P2PU creates a model for lifelong learning while enabling high-quality, low-cost education opportunities&#160;&#8212; in everything from web programming to copyright for educators. The P2PU community chose CC BY-SA as the default license for its platform in order to enable maximum reusability and simultaneously encourage participation and contributions back to the community. <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/pages/license/">P2PU produced a report</a> on its commmunity process and reasoning for choosing the CC BY-SA license.</p>

Most interestingly, Creative Commons licensing is the default on Behance. When you select &#8220;All Rights Reserved&#8221; for a project, you&#8217;re warned that &#8220;This will limit your exposure.&#8221; Many creatives opt to license their works under CC BY-ND, including <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Putih-White-WInes/2986233">this set of labels and packing for an exclusive line of white wines</a>, and <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Tarnated-Typeface/5780963">several</a> <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Sansus-Webissimo/1483039">typefaces</a>. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/35882">Says Founder and CEO Scott Belsky</a>, "Over 75% of content published on Behance is CC-licensed&#8230; the power is shifting away from agencies and middlemen to the creatives themselves.

<p>TPB AFK is a documentary about the founders of the The Pirate Bay, the massive site that provides millions of links to torrent files of music, film, and software. The documentary tracks the lives of the founders during their copyright infringement trial in Sweden. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tpbafk/tpb-afk-the-pirate-bay-away-from-keyboard<br />
">The filmmakers used Kickstarter to raise over $50,000</a> for the film editing. <a href="http://www.tpbafk.tv/2013/01/why-i-chose-creative-commons-for-tpb-afk/<br />
">The filmmakers originally hoped to release the film under an open license that would permit remixing, but ended up having to release it under a CC BY-NC-ND license.</a> &#8220;Since we bought and included around 4 min of archive news material from the Swedish Broadcaster SVT they wouldn&#8217;t allow us to use a license that allowed remix of the film. Since we love remixing and think it&#8217;s an important part of internet culture we will upload a remix-friendly version of the film without the archive material.&#8221; The film is also available without the 4 minutes of SVT footage, licensed under the BY-NC-SA license.</p>
