<p>The following describes each of the six main licenses offered when you choose to <a href="/choose">publish your work</a> with a Creative Commons license. We have listed them starting with the most accommodating license type you can choose and ending with the most restrictive license type you can choose.</p>
<div id="license_conditions">
<h2>License Conditions</h2>
<p>Creators choose a set of conditions they wish to apply to their&nbsp;work.</p>
<div class="attribute_blurb">
<div class="attributes"><img src="img/attrib.gif" alt="Attribution" border="0" height="32" width="32" />
<div><strong>Attribution</strong><br />by</div>
<p>All CC licenses require that others who use your work in any way must give you credit the way you request, but not in a way that suggests you endorse them or their use. If they want to use your work without giving you credit or for endorsement purposes, they must get your permission first.</p>
</div>
<div class="attributes"><img src="img/standard.gif" alt="ShareAlike" border="0" height="32" width="32" />
<div><strong>ShareAlike</strong><br />sa</div>
<p>You let others copy, distribute, display, perform, and modify your work, as long as they distribute any modified work on the same terms. If they want to distribute modified works under other terms, they must get your permission first.</p>
</div>
<div class="attributes"><img src="img/noncomm.gif" alt="NonCommercial" border="0" height="32" width="32" />
<div><strong>NonCommercial</strong><br />nc</div>
<p>You let others copy, distribute, display, perform, and (unless you have chosen NoDerivatives) modify and use your work for any purpose other than commercially unless they get your permission first.</p>
</div>
<div class="attributes"><img src="img/nomod.gif" alt="NoDerivatives" border="0" height="32" width="32" />
<div><strong>NoDerivatives</strong><br />nd</div>
<p>You let others copy, distribute, display and perform only original copies of your work. If they want to modify your work, they must get your permission first.</p>
</div></div>

<div><img src="img/88x31.png" alt="image" width="88" height="31" align="left" /></div>
<h2>Attribution<br /><em>cc by</em></h2>
<p>This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of  licensed materials.</p>

<div><img src="img/88x31.png" alt="image" width="88" height="31" /></div>
<h2>Attribution-ShareAlike<br /><em>cc by-sa</em></h2>
<p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to â€œcopyleftâ€ free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.</p>

<h2>Attribution-NonCommercial<br /><em>cc by-nc</em></h2>
<p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they donâ€™t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.</p>
<p class="deed_links"><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0">View License Deed</a> | <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode">View Legal Code</a></p>
