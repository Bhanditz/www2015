<p>All Creative Commons licenses have many important features in common. </p>
<p>Every license will help you</p>
<ul>
<li>retain your copyright</li>
<li>announce that other people's fair use, first sale, and free expression rights are not affected by the license. </li>
</ul>
<p>Every license requires licensees</p>
<ul>
<li>to get your permission to do any of the things you choose to restrict &#8212; e.g., make a commercial use, create a derivative work;</li>
<li>to keep any copyright notice intact on all copies of your work; </li>
<li>to link to your license from copies of the work; </li>
<li>not to alter the terms of the license </li>
<li>not to use technology to restrict other licensees' lawful uses of the work </li>
</ul>
<p>Every license allows licensees, provided they live up to your conditions,</p>
<ul>
<li>to copy the work </li>
<li>to distribute it </li>
<li>to display or perform it publicly </li>
<li>to make digital public performances of it (e.g., webcasting) </li>
<li>to shift the work into another format as a verbatim copy </li>
</ul>
<p>Every license</p>
<ul>
<li>applies worldwide </li>
<li>lasts for the duration of the work's copyright </li>
<li>is not revocable </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this list of features does not apply to the <a href="/licenses/publicdomain/">Public Domain Dedication</a>, our <a href="/about/sampling/">Sampling Licenses</a>, or <a href="/projects/founderscopyright/">Founder's Copyright</a>.</p>
