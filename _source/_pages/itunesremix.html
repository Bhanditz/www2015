<p><strong>What is iTunes Remix?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>iTunes Remix is a proposed iTunes channel that sells music that is legal for consumers to remix, sample from, and mash-up.</li>
<li>The music will be made available in the form of DRM-free instrument stems, (i.e. separated vocal track, drum track, guitar track, etc.).</li>
<li>The stems will be distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial (CC BY-NC) copyright license. This license gives a clear indicator of what permissions and conditions are attached to the music. Under the CC BY-NC license, a consumer is given the legal right to use the stems as the basis for remixes and mash-ups, as long as he or she only does so for noncommercial purposes and <span id="attribution-container">also attributes the original work to its author or licensor. </span></li>
<li>iTunes Remix music can be made available for purchase either per-stem (i.e. just a song's vocal track) or on an "Album Only" basis - the latter being the way that <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/node/145763">Radiohead's recent remix project</a> stems are sold on iTunes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why should iTunes launch a remix channel?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unmet demand:</strong> As iTunes well knows, todayâ€™s music consumers want interactivity from their music. There are currently millions of unauthorized fan-made remixes of songs available online.</li>
<li><strong>Untapped revenue: </strong>No company is efficiently monetizing this increasingly large market. As iTunes has proven, when you make the experience of buying digital music easy and fun, you can capture revenue that might otherwise be lost to unauthorized downloads. The same is true with remixable music.</li>
<li><strong>A clear opportunity: </strong>Currently, remixers get their source material from either underground (and unauthorized) sources or from a handful of small sites that provide free stems as part of artists' publicity campaigns. iTunes Remix will pioneer the one-stop shop for commercially-available remix-friendly music.</li>
<li><strong>Premium pricing: </strong>iTunes Remix downloads will offer alluring features: previously-unavailable access to song stems and, of course, remix rights. These features could be offered to fans for a premium price â€“ perhaps as much as $1.99 per set of song stems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why should iTunes Remix use Creative Commons licenses?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to use: </strong>All that is required of a licensor is to choose a CC license and express this choice in a way that is clear to the public. In the case of iTunes Remix, this could be as simple as including notification of a CC license alongside the genre, release date, and publishing information that is currently expressed on download pages.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to understand: </strong>Creative Commons licenses offer a simple and "human readable" alternative to full copyright. CC licenses explain in clear and concise language which rights the public has to a given work, as well as which rights the licensor is reserving. (See the CC BY-NC license deed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">here</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Fan friendliness: </strong>While Radiohead's recent remix endeavor is pioneering in some aspects, many fans have complained that the project actually offers the same old deal, in that its terms of use are overly restrictive and don't recognize the rights of the remixer (see, for instance, <a href="http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/04/get-naked-and-r.html">this <em>Wired</em> article</a>). Creative Commons licenses offer the best of both worlds. Licensors grant some rights to the public (i.e. noncommercial use and remix rights) and retain the rest (i.e. commercial rights); licensees know that they are participating in a system that keeps them from being exploited.</li>
<li><strong>Brand recognition: </strong>Creative Commons is the name most strongly associated with remix for artists online. Millions of creators around the world have used our licenses, and there are more than 130 million creative works available to the public under CC terms.</li>
<li><strong>Track record: </strong>Recent high-profile CC licensors includes <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong> (Trent Reznor released his two most recent albums under CC to encourage remixing and sharing; read more <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8095">here</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8267">here</a>) and <strong>Radiohead</strong> (the band released the animation data behind its "House of Cards" video under CC; read more <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8476">here</a>). Many other well-known acts, including the <strong>Beastie Boys, Pearl Jam, David Byrne, Deerhoof, My Morning Jacket, Spoon, Fort Minor, </strong>and <strong>Danger Mouse</strong>, have also used CC licenses to encourage certain uses while retaining the rights to others.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> It is difficult for fans to legally use Radiohead's remix stems in conjunction with other artists' stems (i.e. for mash-ups), because the terms of use that govern the two sets of stems are often not interoperable. Creative Commons licenses solve this problem. CC-licensed material can be mixed and mashed with other CC-licensed material, so that if a fan buys an M.I.A. stem and a Lil Wayne stem, he or she knows that they can be combined, as well as used individually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pilot project: Gilberto Gil's entire new album available via iTunes Remix<br />
</strong></p>
<p>TropicÃ¡lia superstar Gilberto Gil wants to release all of the instrument stems from his upcoming album - not just from one song, but the entire album - under a Creative Commons license. We propose that iTunes Remix launches with this project, where one version of Gil's album is made available for purchase in its standard form, and another version as a collection of stems that are legal to remix under the terms of a CC license. Gil is a well-known promoter of remix culture, music business innovation, and Creative Commons. His support for CC in particular has generated major media interest (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/arts/music/11roht.html">this <em>New York Times</em> article</a>), and there are many outlets who would be interested in telling the iTunes Remix story via Gil's participation. Gil's project is ready to go - he is waiting to release it until the opportunity comes along to do it exactly the way he wants. We believe that iTunes Remix is that opportunity.</p>
