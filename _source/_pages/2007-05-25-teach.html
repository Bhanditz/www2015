Experts predict that the US will need more than two million new teachers in the next decade. So, how do we inspire todayâ€™s young adults to become tomorrowâ€™s educators?</p>
<p>
In 1999, director <a href="/about/people#20">Davis Guggenheim</a> and producer <a href="http://theoscarsite.com/whoswho8/schacter_j.htm">Julia Schachter</a> undertook an ambitious project &mdash; to document the experiences of teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District. In examining the trials and rewards that come with educating our children, the filmmakers created two powerful documentaries: the Peabody Award-winning <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/firstyear">The First Year</a></em>; and <em>Teach</em>, a short film created to attract talented and passionate people to the teaching profession.</p>
<p>
<em>Teach</em> is available under a Creative Commons <a href="/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">BY-NC-ND</a> license and is offered online to the public for free. By using a CC license, Guggenheim and Schachter are allowing people to legally download and share <em>Teach</em>, so that its inspirational message can be easily seen by anyone in the world.</p>
