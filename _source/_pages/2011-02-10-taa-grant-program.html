<h2>High-level description of services</h2>
<p>The partnering organizations will provide TAACCCT grantees a comprehensive set of support and technical assistance to ensure their success. Those services include reinforcing open licensing practices, increasing access to existing open educational resources (OER), Universal Design for Learning (UDL), accessibility and web-based design best practices, as well as professional development in critical policy and adoption practices. Every effort will be made not only to link grantees with existing resources, but also to encourage linkages among them to maximize benefits and build open licensing capacity in the community college space.</p>
<p><strong>Open Licensing Support:</strong> Creative Commons will lend technical support in meeting the open licensing requirement and ensuring interoperability of content. Creative Commons will explain its licenses and tools (especially CC BY) to grantees, and provide both explanatory documentation and outreach to help institutions understand and effectively implement this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Course Design and Best Practices: </strong>OLI and CAST will provide expertise and enabling technologies to ensure that all of the digital content and learning environments developed in this project are designed to succeed with the widest range of learners possible.</p>
<p><strong>Web-Based Learning Environments: Plus Platform and Plus Co-Development:</strong> OLI and CAST will offer two additional options for deeper involvement in building web-based interactive environments. Institutions selected to participate in the â€œPlus Platformâ€ option will have access to OLI's web-based learning platform to host their own open educational resources. A group of multiple subgroups will be selected for â€œPlus Co-developmentâ€ support and engage in a full design process for OER resulting in 3-4 complete learning environments created and hosted on the UDL-enhanced OLI web-based learning platform.</p>
<p><strong>Making the Case: Policy and Best Practices:</strong> SBCTC will utilize its system-wide experience in adoption, re-mix, re-use and distribution of OER to help grantee institutions develop best practices and policies that take full advantage of the TAACCCT grants and process. SBCTC will help grantees understand the direct connections between OER adoption and performance-based funding. SBCTC will develop and provide professional development on adoption and re-use of TAACCCT open content for faculty, deans, provosts, presidents and trustees.</p>
<h2>What is the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) grant program?</h2>
<p>The TAACCCT is a <a href="http://www.federalgrantswire.com/trade-adjustment-assistance-community-college-and-career-training-taaccct-grants.html">grant fund</a> cooperatively administered through the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of Education. The program will make available US $2 billion over the next four years for grants that will â€œprovide community colleges and other eligible institutions of higher education with funds to expand and improve their ability to deliver education and career training programs.â€ The <a href="http://www.doleta.gov/grants/pdf/SGA-DFA-PY-10-03.pdf">solicitation for grant applications</a> (PDF) requires that all resources created using these funds must be released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC BY) license:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to further the goal of career training and education and encourage innovation in the development of new learning materials, as a condition of the receipt of a Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grant (â€œGrantâ€), the Grantee will be required to license to the public (not including the Federal Government) all work created with the support of the grant (â€œWorkâ€) under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (â€œLicenseâ€). This License allows subsequent users to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt the copyrighted work and requires such users to attribute the work in the manner specified by the Grantee. Notice of the License shall be affixed to the Work.</p></blockquote>
<p>The program supports President Obamaâ€™s goal of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020 by helping to increase the number of workers who attain degrees, certificates, and other industry-recognized credentials. The first round of funding will be $500 million over the next year. Applications to the solicitation are now open, and will be due April 21, 2011.</p>

<h2>What is Creative Commons?</h2>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> is a nonprofit organization that develops copyright licenses and other tools used by individuals, nonprofits, governments, and companies to encourage sharing and innovation. Our free tools provide a simple, standardized way for creators to keep their copyright while allowing certain uses of their work â€” a â€œsome rights reservedâ€ approach to copyright. CC <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">licenses</a> incorporate a unique and innovative three-layer design, with a traditional legal tool (Legal Code), a â€œhuman readableâ€ deed (Commons Deed), and a â€œmachine readableâ€ format that describes license information in a way search engines and other kinds of technology can understand. Creative Common licenses and tools are <a href="http://creativecommons.org/education">already in use</a> by educators, schools, content platforms, and publishers. Our licenses make textbooks and lesson plans easy to find, easy to share, and easy to customize and combine â€” helping to realize the full benefits of digitally enabled education.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC BY) license?</strong></h2>
<p>CC BY is a copyright license that grants permission to the public to reproduce, distribute, perform, display or adapt the licensed materials for any purpose so long as the user gives attribution to the author or as otherwise directed by the copyright holder.Â CC licenses are built on top of and encourage respect for copyright and copyright holders. CC licenses are non-exclusive, allowing publishers of works to further license their works under different licence terms. For more information about CC BY, see theÂ <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">license deed</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode">legal code</a>.</p>
<h2>Why is CC BY required?</h2>
<p>Requiring the release of materials created using TAACCCT grant funds under CC BY maximizes the public benefit of the funding dollars expended. CC BY gives individuals, nonprofits and businesses permission to use and build upon material created with public funds, so long as the creator is credited. Innovative use of these materials may be made by any teacher, parent, and school district, nationwide and beyond. The materials will be available for reuse and value-add by creative entrepreneurs, education start-ups, and traditional commercial businesses.</p>
<p>In order to be used dependably by teachers, businesses, or institutions that desire to innovate, publicly funded materials must be clearly licensed and marked as such in order to modify the default copyright rule that â€œall rights are reserved.â€ CC BY is the gold standard for doing so, permitting publicly funded materials to be reliably leveraged and used alongside similarly licensed content and in conjunction with existing initiatives at community colleges and elsewhere.</p>
