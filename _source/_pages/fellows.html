<span class="smalldates">Started: August 2008</span></p>
<p>Jacob Beal is a researcher working on engineered self-organization: the science of obtaining predictable aggregate behavior from collections of unreliable devices with local and non-linear interactions. His focus in this area is on problems of system integration for human-level intelligence and on problems of modelling and control for spatially-distributed networks like sensor networks, robotic swarms, and cells during morphogenesis. Dr. Beal, who has a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, is completing a postdoctoral position at MIT and beginning as a Scientist at BBN Technologies in Fall, 2008.</p>

<span class="smalldates">Started: April 2009</span></p>
<p>Puneet evangelizes open access to geospatial data, science and technology as a senior Science Commons Fellow. Puneet was a Science Policy Fellow at the National Academies which got him interested in open data. He is an elected Charter member of the Open Source GeoSpatial Foundation, and a researcher in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is building a web-based carbon modeling tool. Puneet has worked as an engineer in a small New Delhi NGO, internationally as a GIS specialist at the World Bank in Washington DC, and at a private GIS consulting firm in Madison, Wisconsin. Puneet has an engineering degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, an M.S. from UW-Madison, and is a Ph.D. candidate at UW-Madison trying to develop a methodology for measuring information accessibility.</p>

<span class="smalldates">Started: June 2009</span></p>
<p>Jordan is best known for building the Napster backend software including real-time search and chat and scaling it up to 80 million users.  He has founded multiple companies, the most recent one was SNOCAP. It was a real-time copyright clearinghouse that allowed P2P systems to identify content and retrieve licensing information. SNOCAP became the primary MySpace storefront for music. As a Science Commons Fellow, Jordan is working on a system to transition scientific publications from isolated islands of text to highly interconnected collaborative pages that can be discussed, annotated, organized and edited. </p>
