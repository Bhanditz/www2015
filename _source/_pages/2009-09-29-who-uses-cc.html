<h3>Al Jazeera</h3>
<p>In early 2009, Al Jazeera <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12049">launched</a> a <a href="http://cc.aljazeera.net/">Creative Commons Repository</a>--a section of their website dedicated to posting videos under the CC Attribution license. These videos were shot in Gaza, highlighting the Israeli/Palestine conflict. Whereas most Western media had no access to the area, Al Jazeera was visibly present. As a result, the footage was both eye-opening and highly functionalâ€”it was footage that <strong>anyone</strong> could view and use freely, from the general public to rival news networks, as long as Al Jazeera was credited. More recently Al Jazeera launched <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/18599">Al Jazeera Blogs</a>, a website featuring posts written by prominent journalists and correspondents from  Al Jazeera television network, all released under a CC BY-NC-ND license.

<h3>Flickr</h3>
<p>Flickr was one of the first major online communities to incorporate Creative Commons licensing options into its user interface, giving photographers around the world the easy ability to share photos on terms of their choosing. As the Flickr community grew, so did the number of CC-licensed images &mdash; currently there are well over 200 million on the site &mdash; establishing Flickr as the Web's single largest source of CC-licensed content. Flickr's services have grown to include a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">CC image portal</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/advanced/">advanced CC search features</a>, making the site one of world's most useful resources for discovering creativity that is available for free and legal sharing, use, and remixing.

<h3>Google</h3>
<p>Google has utilized CC licenses in a variety of instances throughout their digital services. Either by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5693">enabling CC-search capabilities</a> through their main search engine, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15691">image search engine</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/16823">book search engine</a>, or by allowing users to CC license their own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/9160">content in Picasa</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8506">Google Knol</a>, and documentation at Google Code. YouTube, which is Google-owned, has <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27533">added the CC BY licensing option</a> for video uploads; used CC-licenses in their <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12183">audio-swap program</a>, allowing users to swap "All Rights Reserved" music for similar-sounding CC-licensed tracks; and has also enabled CC-licensing for select institutions.

<h3>Nine Inch Nails</h3>
<p>When Trent Reznor decided to shake up the music industry through a new distribution model, the Nine Inch Nails front-man used CC as an anchor point, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8095">releasing</a> the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11293">Grammy nominated</a> Ghosts I-IV under a CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. While Reznor gave the first disc away for free digitally, NIN sold tiered offerings ranging from a $5 download of the full album to a $300 premium box set. Limited to 2,500 units, the box set netted $750,000 in profit for the band. Ghosts went on to become the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11947">#1 paid MP3 download</a> on Amazon.com for 2008. NIN's next album, The Slip, was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8267">released</a> for free under the same license, fueling a sold-out tour.

<h3>OpenCourseWare</h3>
<p><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> has been releasing its materials under a CC BY-NC-SA license since 2004.

<h3>Public Library of Science</h3>
<p>Open Access journals are a key component to the knowledge sharing cycle in scholarly communication. There are a number of journals that are leading the way in ensuring and enabling the sharing and reuse of scholarly content, most notably the <a href="http://www.plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a> (PLoS), <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/">BioMed Central</a>, and <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/">Hindawi</a>. PLoS, for example, publishes <a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/">seven scientific journals</a>, including the high-impact <em>PLoS Biology</em> and <em>PLoS Medicine</em>, and <em>PLoS ONE</em>, a web-centric rethink of the scientific journal. All PLoS content is published under a Creative Commons Attribution license - the freest license in the Creative Commons suite, and also in compliance with the definition of <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm">Open Access</a>.

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>Wikipedia <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/15411">recently migrated</a> its licensing structure from the GNU Free Documentation License to a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. The world's largest and most cited collaborative encyclopedia made this move via a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/14647">community vote</a> and for <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13967">good reason</a>. By changing to a CC BY-SA license, Wikipedia (and the entire collection of Wikimedia sites) allows content to legally flow in and out of the site with ease, enabling one of the great cultural resources of the digital revolution to legally interact with an endless array of similar cultural institutions.

<h3>Whitehouse.gov</h3>
<p>The Obama Administration has used Creative Commons licenses in a variety of ways, from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/10541">licensing presidential campaign photos</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/11081">releasing information</a> on transition site Change.gov via a CC Attribution license, to requiring that third-party content posted on Whitehouse.gov be <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/12267">made available</a> via CC Attribution Only as well. The US Government's stance on openness is unsurprising, as its CTO, Aneesh Chopra, has <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17863">gone on record</a> stating that CC licenses have directly informed his perspective on how intellectual property should be accessed, shared, and reusedâ€”not to mention derived, adapted, and remixed.
