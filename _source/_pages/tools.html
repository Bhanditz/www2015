<h2><a href="/tools/ccpublisher">CC Publisher</a></h2>
<p>CC Publisher is a tool that does two things: it will help you tag your audio and video files with information about your license and it allows you to upload Creative Commons-licensed audio <strong>and</strong> video works to the <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> for free hosting. You also have the option of publishing the licensed and tagged audio works on your own site.</p>
<p><a href="/tools/ccpublisher">Download and read more about it</a></p>
<h2><a href="/tools/cclookup">CC Lookup</a></h2>
<p>CC Lookup is a tool to verify embedded license information. MP3 files tagged with <a href="ccpublisher">our CC Publisher application</a> carry information about what license was chosen for the file and a public URL where the license can be validated. If you've downloaded an audio file from <a href="http://archive.org/">the Internet Archive</a> or a P2P network like <a href="/audio/publish-morpheus">Morpheus</a> that claims to be Creative Commons licensed, this application will verify that for you.</p>

<p>We have some extensions for Mozilla-based browsers (including Firefox), to enable viewing of Creative Commons licenses within your browser automatically.</p>
