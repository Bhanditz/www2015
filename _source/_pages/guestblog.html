<p>The <a href="/weblog/">Creative Commons blog</a> is a resource for the open community, featuring news and analysis on Creative Commons licenses as well as broader issues like open access, open science, open educational resources, and more. We invite members of our community to write guest blog posts for the CC Blog.</p>
<h2>What we're looking for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Interesting stories of how people, companies, organizations, and governments use Creative Commons licenses.</li>
<li>Coverage of legislation or policy changes of interest to the CC community: copyright law, funding for open educational resources, open access, etc.</li>
<li>Reviews of CC-licensed content.</li>
<li>Interviews with people who use CC licenses or advocate for open policy.</li>
<li>Generally, content that's easy to read on a computer. Once in awhile, we'll publish a longer interview or well-written thought piece, but most of our blog posts are under 1000 words.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we're not looking for</h2>
<ul>
<li>The same press release you sent to 100 music or art blogs. Tell us a bit about why CC licensing is a part of your project, or a story about how someone transformed your project thanks to open licenses. That will be much more interesting to us and to our readers.</li>
<li>Advocacy of a specific political party or candidate. Creative Commons does not and cannot endorse political candidates, but we can and do write about their policies, when those policies are relevant to our mission.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to submit a guest blog post</h2>
<p>Email <a href="mailto:press@creativecommons.org">press@creativecommons.org</a>, either with the text of your blog post or a proposal for what you'd like to write about. If it's the latter, include a link to another piece of writing or two.</p>
<p>We'll reply as quickly as we can. If it looks like a good fit, we'll be in touch with any suggested edits.</p>
<p>Creative Commons has the final say on any content that we publish. That said, we won't make any edits beyond basic grammar and style edits without running them by you first.</p>
